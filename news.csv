"2025-04-24 22:14:46";"Another Bitcoin Treasury Is Coming To Wall Street";"Wall Street's getting a new Bitcoin treasury. Shares of Cantor Equity Partners (CEP)—ablank check companyheaded by Brandon Lutnick, son ofPresident Trump's commerce secretary—soared 50% on Thursday, a day after it announced a deal to take “Bitcoin-native” Twenty One, “a newly formed entity,” public viaSPACmerger.The stock has risen more than 200% since Wednesday's announcement. Twenty One is expected to go public with more than 42,000 bitcoin, the third-largest corporate bitcoin treasury in the world. The company will be majority-owned by stablecoin issuerTetherand its affiliated exchangeBitfinex, which are supplying 31,500 bitcoin. Investment holding company SoftBank has agreed to purchase some of Tether’s shares to take “significant minority ownership.” In a pitch to private investors, the company said it would “leverage its Bitcoin to generate returns for shareholders and benefit from Bitcoin’s potential for price appreciation.” The Trump administration was one element of the company's pitch. In March, Trump ordered thecreation of a bitcoin reserveand has advocated for Congress and federal agencies to develop a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Twenty One follows in the footsteps ofMichael Saylor’sStrategy (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, which in recent years has morphed from a company that makes software to a company thatissues stock to collect Bitcoin. Beyond accumulating Bitcoin, Twenty One says it plans “to accelerate Bitcoin adoption” at the corporate and sovereign level through media operations and develop “Bitcoin-related financial and advisory services.” The company will be led by Jack Mallers, the founder and CEO of Strike, a payments platform.Mallers, the company said, is “one of Bitcoin’s most influential advocates” and “was instrumental” in El Salvador’s decision to become the first country to recognize Bitcoin asfiat currency.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/another-bitcoin-treasury-is-coming-to-wall-street-twenty-one-lutnick-trump-11721669"
"2025-04-25 02:48:29";"Watch These Intel Price Levels as Chipmaker's Stock Tumbles on Soft Outlook";"Intel (INTC) shares slumped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmakerposted a quarterly outlook that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The chipmaker saiduncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s tariff policieshad led customers to stockpile chips in the first quarter, which it expects will weigh on current quarter revenue as a result.Newly installed CEO Lip-Bu Tan cautioned that it would take the company time to gain market share and drive sustainable growth. Intel shares have outperformed theS&P 500since the start of the year amid hopes of a turnaround under Lip-Bu Tan’s leadership. However, the stock is down about 37% over the past 12 months amid worries about the company’s strategic direction and its inability to make inroads into the booming AI chip market. Intel shares, which gained more than 4% during Thursday's regular session, fell 5.1% to $20.39 in after-hours trading. Below, we take a closer look at Intel’s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. Sincegappingsharply lower last August, Intel shares have driftedsidewaysin an extendedtrading range, helping to establish identifiable trading levels. More recently, an upswing in the stock, which coincided with therelative strength index (RSI)reclaiming the 50 threshold, looks set to end abruptly on Friday following the chipmaker’s uninspiring earnings report. Let’s identify lower price levels on Intel’s chart that could providesupportand also point out two key overhead areas that may attract interest during future upswings. Amid projected post-earnings weakness in the stock, investors should initially watch a major level of support at $19. This area on the chart would likely attract considerable buying interest near the extended trading range’s lowertrendline. Abreakdownbelow this key technical area could see the shares trend lower toward $15. We projected this level by taking the price bars comprising the stock’s decline from late March to early April and overlaying them from Thursday’s high. This analysis projects that three down trending legs may potentially be playing out on the chart. During an upswing in the stock, it’s worth keeping track of the $22 area, which sits roughly at the midway point of the extended trading range. The shares could run into overhead selling pressure in this location near the 50-day and200-day moving averagesand a trendline that connects multiplepeaks and troughson the chart stretching back to early August last year. Finally, a broader recovery could see Intel shares revisit the extended trading range’s upper trendline around $26. Investors who haveaccumulated the stockat lower levels may decide to book profits in this region near three notable peaks that formed on the chart between November and March.

"2025-04-25 10:30:00";"Amid Market Chaos, Downside Protection Securities Beloved By Brokers Are Booming";"Structured Notes and Buffer funds are sleep-well-at-night products designed to protect investors from market drops. Brokers and nervous investors love them, despite their complexity and fees.  Talk to any financial advisor these days, and he or she is likely to have a strong opinion about something known as “structured notes.” These complex products are sold as the “have your cake and eat it” investments of the wealth management world. Their specialty is flexibility –some are geared toward growth and others toward income. Returns are generally capped and in all cases the goal is to limit downside risk. They are manufactured by big banks like JPMorgan using derivatives, and are often sold as “stock market-linked” with “sleep well at night” protection. They come with various maturities, typically ranging from six months to five years, provide principal protection and sometimes offer annual yields of 10% or more.  Up until the last few years, structured notes were mostly the domain of hedge funds and other sophisticated investors or ultra-wealthy clients. But thanks to clever engineering, the notes are now being offered by scores of brokers and sold in bite-sized $1000 increments. The current market volatility and uncertainty has caused them to surge in popularity. Last year the broker-sold U.S. structured notes market reached a record high of nearly $150 billion, up 46% from the previous year, according to London’s Deriva Intelligence. JPMorgan was the top issuer in 2024, followed closely by the likes of Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays.  “I absolutely love structured notes,” says Anh Tran, an independent advisor at $350 million (assets) SageMint Wealth in Irvine, California. Structured notes make up about 30% of the allocation in most of Tran’s client portfolios. “I’ve never had so many calls from advisors reaching out asking if we can talk to them about how we run our portfolios,” says Tran.  “Clients are using structured notes not because they’re ‘hot,’ but because they allow you to take more control of the outcome,” insists Michaelangelo Dooley, Structured Note Strategies Portfolio Manager at $30 billion investment advisory NewEdge. Dooley is referring to the fact that these securities can be tailor made to meet the demand created by specific market environments. A few years ago when rates were low, for example, stock market notes offering income of 10-12% were popular. “Each [note] is entirely different with the risk that it takes on. Even within the same category—like contingent yield notes—two products might have similar structures but vastly different outcomes based on the underlying assets.” One could be tied to the S&P 500, another to Tesla or Nvidia stock, Dooley notes, adding: “They are not comparable trades.”  Take Bank of Montreal’s freshly issued Senior Medium Term Notes, Series K, Market Linked Notes due April 2028. The notes, which are one of the first products to roll off of a $78 billion shelf registration, bear no interest and are designed to track the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, which is down 11% year to date. The maximum gain noteholders are entitled to is 22.8%. Thus, if in three years, when the notes are due, the Nasdaq100 is up 35% from its level on April 25, 2025, investors will only be entitled to $1,228.00 for each $1000 par amount note. However if tech stocks continue to fall and the Nasdaq 100 is down 35%, the BMO structured note holders get their original $1,000 returned.  Another type of structured note is known as a “buffered” note. These, which typically track an index like the S&P 500, allow for a cushion—say, 20% or 30%—against losses. If the asset declines 15%, the investor’s principal is preserved. If it drops 35%, the first 30% is protected and the investor takes only the final 5% loss. Contingent income notes offer periodic income—say, 9% annually—as long as the underlying asset or index doesn’t fall below a preset barrier. They are often “autocallable,” meaning they redeem early if the reference asset hits a high price target price. If markets are stable or rising, this feature can allow for quick realization of gains and capital return. But when markets stay choppy—like they have been in 2025—the notes may linger to maturity, still paying income but testing investor patience. Contingent barrier notes, meanwhile, act like a trapdoor. If the index stays above a set barrier—commonly 60-75% of its initial value—the investor gets their principal back, possibly with a coupon. But if the barrier is breached, protection vanishes, and the note’s return moves in tandem with the underlying asset, meaning that the client assumes a 1:1 loss. According to Andrew Kuefler, SVP of Product Strategy at alternative investments marketplace iCapital, the current volatility has made these autocallable contingent income notes especially attractive. “When uncertainty spikes, these products offer yields in the 7–10% range with 30–45% downside protection,” he says. “Advisors are using them to harvest volatility and generate income without taking full equity risk.” Following market events like Trump’s tariff announcement, Kuefler noted quote requests surged by 140% week-over-week—clear evidence of rising advisor interest. These novel securities are not without their costs. Bank of Montreal charges advisory firms a 2.5% commission for creating the notes. Then financial advisors likewise, get their cut from clients after that. Unlike ETFs of mutual funds, these notes also have limited liquidity and even under the best case scenario, an investor would likely do just as well by investing in a high yield corporate bond fund, which is inherently less risky and less complex. Vanguard’s High Yield Bond Fund, with its expense ratio of 0.22%, is currently yielding 7%, about the same annual return you would achieve under the best case scenario with the BMO’s new Nasdaq100-Linked structured notes. Greenwich Connecticut’s AQR Research is a big critic of structured notes like BMO’s, as well as similarly structured funds and ETFs that are sold as “Defined Outcome” or “Buffer” Funds. In March, AQR issued research saying it would be smarter and cheaper for investors to simply their exposure from 100% stocks, to say 70% with 30% in Treasury bills, than to invest in one of these options-fueled funds. “These ‘buffer funds’ are a marketing success, a success for the managers selling them, and a failure for investors lured in by the overpromise of magical equity returns without equity risk and then overcharged for the pleasure,” writes Daniel Villalon, Global co-head of portfolio solutions at AQR. Like their broker-sold cousins “buffer ETFs” have soared in popularity recently. According to Morningstar, assets have ballooned to $58 billion up from their inception in 2018. One of the most popular is Defined Wealth Shield ETF, from Wheaton, Illinois’ Innovator Funds. The $1.4 billion (assets) fund whose symbol BALT, stands for “bond alternative” and like other buffer ETFs, is designed to allow for some market gain participation but limit losses. BALT allows investors to participate in S&P 500 gains capped at 2.47% each quarter, but protects them from any losses up to 20% on the downside during the same quarter. During 2024’s roaring 23% run in the S&P 500, BALT owners would have earned just under 10%. Year-to-date, with the S&P down 9% BALT is off only 1%. Critics of structured investment vehicles argue that the complexity masks inefficiencies and cost. They also warn that their perceived safety evaporates during black swan type economic events—like a global recession. Structured notes are unsecured obligations and are thus, only as sound as the financial institutions issuing them. During the financial crisis, investors lost nearly all of their principal in the more than $18 billion in structured notes issued by Lehman Brothers. “Banks and advisors make a ton of money on them,” says one Morgan Stanley advisor who asked to remain anonymous. “But in worst-case scenarios like 2008, they were the worst thing to hold.

Who are we referring to? It’s TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Still overlooking it? We understand. It’s not an exciting tech name or a new AI superstar. It may seem dull. However, this is precisely the tactical error you should sidestep if you aim to grow your wealth.   Evading significant fluctuations is crucial for wealth accumulation. The High-Quality portfolio, which aims to minimize volatility while providing compounding upside, has surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.  Let’s see if you still consider TDG stock unexciting after what we’ll share.  You’ve heard enough about tech stocks that fluctuate like trapeze artists. But what if there exists a stock that offers tech-like returns without the chaotic movements? One that provides you with a 5.5% dividend– right now – and possesses the strength to increase that payout continuously?   Introducing the defense stock that quietly exceeds expectations – TDG MORE FOR YOU‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 26New Google Leak Reveals Subscription Changes For Gemini AIGoogle Issues Emergency Chrome Security Update — Act Now Your Bank Isn’t Paying You This At 5.5%, this dividend outperforms most savings accounts, money markets, and even Treasuries. But here’s the catch – this dividend isn’t a “set-it-and-forget-it” yield. It has momentum behind it.   Revenue growth: 16.9% in the past 12 months, and 18.7% average over the last 3 years Margins: 46% operating margin, 22% net margin, and 23% operating cash flow margin  What does this signify? This isn’t merely a dividend investment – it’s a cash-generating machine with growth potential. With healthy margins and swift revenue growth, dividends are set to increase as well. This implies that yields could rise or stay consistent as the stock price appreciates. Either way – you benefit! You enjoy growing income year after year. But Hold On – It’s Not Just About Yield Many income stocks offer substantial dividends. Few provide them in conjunction with stability and capital appreciation.   This defense stock has produced an annualized 38% return over the last 5 years. And here’s the exciting part: no dramatic 50%+ drops – except during the COVID crash when everything plummeted.  Contrast that with your favorite tech stocks. Nvidia: -62% in 2022, Meta: -75% drop from peak to trough, and Tesla – well, let’s not even discuss that. With this defense investment, you’re compounding quietly and steadily. And guess what – with its impressive margins, robust cash flow, and a DE ratio of 30%, this stock has considerable capacity to manage increased interest costs as debts are refinanced at higher yields in the coming years. This indicates that the risk to dividend growth is minimal.   Designed for Uncertainty – And the Next Economic Landscape Think defense stocks are dull? Think again. Tariffs have returned. U.S.-China tensions are rising. The new industrial policy wave (whether called re-shoring, de-risking, or “Make America Build Again”) represents a favorable environment for defense expenses. Defense firms are not only safeguarded – they are positioned to prosper. And TDG has remained steadfast during market crises in the past.  2018 Market Correction: Stock declined only 16% from its peak in October while major companies faced severe declines, and for the entire year, it yielded 24% compared to -4.5% for the S&P – a significant outperformance 2022 Inflation Shock: Stayed positive throughout the year, at +1.7%, while the S&P fell by more than 18% 2025 Tariff Turmoil: Currently outperforming again, surpassing the S&P by nearly 15%.

More in Berlin, Germany. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)Photothek via Getty Images Microsoft’s stock has declined approximately 7% this year, primarily due to investor concerns about potential tariff impacts. However, this concern appears largely overblown as Microsoft’s business model centers around Azure cloud services and software rather than hardware, making it substantially less vulnerable to tariff-related disruptions than hardware-focused tech companies. Separately, for another strong tech name, see Should You Buy GOOG Stock After A Q1 Beat?   Long-Term Performance Looking beyond short-term fluctuations reveals an impressive trajectory: Microsoft's stock has gained approximately 65% since early 2023, driven by:   28% expansion in P/E ratio (from 24 to 31) 1% reduction in outstanding shares (now 7.5 billion) 27% increase in net profits (from $73B to $93B)  Sustainable Growth Drivers Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% revenue increase, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $262 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors:    Cloud Services: Azure and Microsoft 365 continue to be powerful growth engines as businesses accelerate digital transformation initiatives. Artificial Intelligence: Microsoft has strategically integrated AI across its product portfolio, with its AI business already exceeding $13B in annual revenue. Gaming Expansion: The Activision Blizzard acquisition has significantly strengthened Microsoft's gaming division, substantially boosting Xbox content and services revenue.  Profitability Picture Despite a slight margin contraction (from 36.7% to 35.4%) due to increased AI and R&D investments, Microsoft maintains an exceptionally healthy 35% net margin. The company's EPS has increased 29% from $9.65 in 2022 to $12.41 in the trailing twelve months.  Market Resilience Microsoft has demonstrated remarkable resilience during market downturns:  During the 2022 inflation shock, Microsoft recovered fully from a 36.3% decline within seven months During the 2020 pandemic, the company rebounded from a 28.2% drop in just four months  MORE FOR YOU‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 26New Google Leak Reveals Subscription Changes For Gemini AIGoogle Issues Emergency Chrome Security Update — Act Now Why Microsoft? Microsoft has positioned itself as essential infrastructure for the AI revolution. Similar to how Nvidia provides the GPU processing power, Microsoft delivers the computing resources, data storage, and networking capabilities that underpin AI development across numerous companies, including OpenAI. This allows investors exposure to the broader AI growth story without needing to predict which specific AI application will ultimately dominate.  The Verdict Microsoft represents a compelling investment opportunity despite near-term volatility. Its cloud-first business model shields it from significant tariff impacts, while its position as fundamental infrastructure for the AI revolution provides substantial long-term growth potential with less risk than pure-play AI companies. Currently trading around $390, Microsoft's stock has a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31x. Although this is higher than the 24x P/E ratio observed in 2022, it is still below the stock's four-year average P/E of 35x, suggesting potential for further appreciation.

Before you say it - yes we know the chip giant's stock just surged on tariff relief rumors - but that’s like a dead cat bounce. Under the hood, risks are piling up. Don’t be surprised if Nvidia tanks to $60 before another truly bullish rally takes over.   This contrarian view isn’t just gut instinct - it’s part of the macro-conscious, fundamentals-first philosophy that drives our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception.  That same philosophy also guides our thinking beyond individual stocks.

Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against NAPCO and the underwriter defendants.” “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter.

Hint: It's More Than What's in Fort Knox";"Collectively, families across India have almost 25,000 tonnes of gold, making them the highest private owners of gold in the world. To put it in perspective, Indian families have a gold stash almost six times greater than the gold stored in Fort Knox. Gold serves various purposes in India. It is collected and kept as afinancial shieldshould economic turmoil arise, it is given as a gift at celebrations, and in rural areas, it takes the place of banking. As part of the cultural fabric, women collect gold jewelry, which is seen as a symbol of wealth, and it is often passed down from one generation to the next. And atweddings, gold jewelry is given to the bride, and gold bars are presented to the happy couple. Despite its importance in Indian life, there are restrictions on how much gold individuals can hold. According toincome taxlaws in India, married women are allowed to hold as much as 500 grams of gold. For unmarried women, this amount is lower, at 250 grams. Indian men may only hold up to 100 grams of gold. The total discovered gold in human history. In addition to its cultural importance in India, gold serves as a financial investment worldwide. It is often seen as an economic hedge when markets tumble. The price of gold as of April 25, 2025, is $3,305.70 per ounce. This is up from $2,331.71 per ounce in April 2024. Gold has been a solidinvestmentover the past 17 years. In April 2008, the price of gold was $1,354.54 per ounce, a triple-digit increase compared with today's price. However, gold is also a highly speculative asset with volatile price shifts and doesn't provide interest or dividends. Owning physical gold also comes with security and storage demands. Beyond owning bars or jewelry, gold investments can include exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks in gold mining operations. Indian families, particularly Indian women, are large holders of gold. This precious metal has a significant cultural meaning for Indian people, as they gift gold at weddings and pass it down from generation to generation.

"2025-04-25 21:40:00";"Stashing Cash While You Wait for Trump's Tariffs to Shake Out? Today's Top Safe Havens Pay Up to 5.00%";"The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Giventhe economic rollercoaster triggeredby President Trump's continually evolving tariff policy, boosting the cash you have in reserve seems wise. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or shifting funds from stocks into cash vehicles, it's important to consider how much you can earn from different strategies. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, indicating the change from a week ago. Right now you can earn the highest rate with ahigh-yield savings account, with two options paying 5.00%. However, those two leaders have some special requirements that might not suit your needs, with 4.60% being the top high-yield savings rate with ""no strings attached."" Savings and money market account rates can drop at any time, however. To ensure you earn today's rates for months or even years into the future,consider a CD instead. The top rate there is also 4.60%, for terms of 6 to 10 months. Or you can lock in a slightly lower APY that will be guaranteed for longer. Rates on brokerage money market funds and cash management accounts showed little change this week, while rates on Treasurys held mostly steady in the shorter durations but declined somewhat among longer bonds. The rates below are the top nationally available APYs from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed, but can change at any time. Treasury securities pay their rate through maturity and can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect, or can be bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage. I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirect and can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account—sometimes called ahigh-yield savings account—that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you18 options paying 4.35% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type—money market or savings—pays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.40% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includesoptions paying up to 4.60% APY. Note that the ""top rates"" quoted for savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research of hundreds of banks and credit unions. These are very different from the national averages, comprising all institutions offering accounts of those types—including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, national averages are always low, while the top rates we present are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.96% to 4.22% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds ""swept"" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- to 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.74% to 4.75%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsdirectly fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect—the U.S. Treasury’s online platform for buying federal government securities—has no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. Every six months you own the bond, your rate will change. I bond rates will go up on May 1. While we don't know the exact rate Treasury will announce that day fornewbonds, we know that for existing I bond holders, your next six-month rate will increase by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe upcoming rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

The stock’s next catalyst might be just a few days away. Lip-Bu Tan, who presided over thechip company’s quarterly resultsThursday for the first time as CEO, will on Tuesday give the keynote address at an event associated with Intel’s Foundry business, which makes chips for other companies.Bank of America analysts in a Friday note said the event could be paired with the announcement of partnerships with other big tech firms. Intel has sought to grow the Foundry business; early last year, itspoke of ambitionsto be the world’s second-largest foundry behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) by 2030. Its 2024 foundry revenue, however, fell from a year earlier—it came in north of $17 billion, roughly 30% of the company’s total—and its operating loss widened. This year reports have suggested that Intel might look to sell a stake in the Foundry operation to TSMC; that company, however,has denied talks. Investors were tracking the possibility that a spinoff or sale of Foundry might be in the works wellbefore Tan took over. Investors continue to look for signs of dealmaking. Optimism about a range of possibilities, ranging all the way up to a sale of the entire company, has moved the shares in recent months. That could still be the case. But Tan has said cost-cutting is also a priority: On Thursday, while not formally announcing layoff plansreported earlier in the week, he made clearthey are coming. Bank of America analysts, who have a neutral rating for Intel's stock and a $23 price target that is a few cents above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, said Intel is “too big to turn around quickly, but optionality [is] still there.” The stock has lost over a third of its value in the past year through Friday's close.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/this-event-could-be-the-next-catalyst-for-intel-stock-11722067"

"2025-04-26 12:25:00";"2 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now";"Tech stocks have taken investors on a wild ride in 2025, with tariffs, interest-rate jitters, and a new presidential administration fueling market volatility. But while many are running for the exits, savvy investors know that short-term chaos can create long-term opportunity. Here are a few of those stocks -- trading at significant discounts -- that are worth a closer look while Wall Street catches its breath. AppLovin(APP3.39%)provides technology and tools to help mobile app developers effectively market, monetize, and grow their apps.The stock trades recently traded around $270 per share and has increased by more than 300% since its initial public offering in 2021. Yet the stock is down roughly 23% in 2025, in part due to the investigative investment firm Muddy Waters Research releasing a short report on the company claimingthat AppLovin appears to be violating the platforms' terms of service. As a result, Muddy Waters believes AppLovin could lose business to competitors, claiming a 23% client churn rate in the first quarter 2025. AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi pushed back against the short report, describing it as ""littered with inaccuracies and false assertions."" Foroughi emphasized that the company operates in full compliance with App Store policies and stressed that its business is ""based on transparency and integrity."" AppLovin delivered strong financial results in 2024, generating $4.7 billion inrevenueand $2.1 billion infree cash flow-- marking year-over-year increases of 43.4% and 100%, respectively. The company has been putting its free cash flow to work by buying back stock, reducing its shares outstanding by 10% over the past three years. As of the end of 2024, it still has $2.3 billion remaining under its share repurchase program.  APP Price to Free Cash Flowdata byYCharts AppLovin's valuation may look steep at first glance -- trading at 43.6times free cash flow-- but high multiples are par for the course in the world of tech and growth stocks, where investors pay for future potential. What makes AppLovin stand out is its rapid growth: With free cash flow doubling in 2024, the premium looks far more palatable. Plus, the stock is currently trading about 50% below its peak price-to-free cash flow multiple, making this high-growth company look like a bargain. Arguably, at this stage of theartificial intelligence (AI)boom,Nvidia(NVDA4.11%), a chip supplier, has been the largest beneficiary. It provides the ecosystem of software and materials to support AI development.After its stock skyrocketed over the past few years, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable publicly traded company. Since then, the stock has cooled to $104 per share, falling more than 30% from its peak of $153 per share. Despite the price fluctuations, the business is humming along. In fiscal 2025, Nvidia generated $130.5 billion in revenue and $72.9 billion innet income, representing an incredible increase of 114% and 145%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2024. One reason for the recent dip in Nvidia's stock is growing uncertainty around tariffs, which could pressure the company's highgross margin. Nvidia's gross margin, a key indicator of cost efficiency and pricing power, stood at 78.4% in fiscal Q1 2025, but management expects it to decrease to between 70.6% and 71% in fiscal Q1 2026. If that projection holds, it would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of margin contraction. Addressing the issue during the company's February earnings call, CFO Colette Kress acknowledged the uncertainty around tariffs, saying, ""It's a little bit of an unknown, it's an unknown until we understand further what the U.S. government's plan is, both its timing, it's where, and how much."" For a mature company like Nvidia, theprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioremains a widely used valuation tool, measuring a company's stock price relative to its earnings over the past 12 months. Currently, Nvidia trades at 35.6 times trailing earnings -- a figure that might seem steep to traditional value investors. However, when considering theforward P/E ratio, which reflects expectations for the next 12 months of earnings, the valuation appears far more attractive at 23.6 times earnings.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Looking further ahead, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's long-term optimism surrounding the AI revolution helps support the company's valuation. On the company's most recent earnings call, Huang outlined a sweeping vision for the role of AI, stating: Every fintech company will [use AI]. Climate tech companies use AI. Mineral discovery now uses AI ... every higher education, every university uses AI, and so I think it is fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream and that it's being integrated into every application. Whenever the market turns turbulent, growth stocks are often the first to take a hit -- and that's exactly what investors are seeing now. Both AppLovin and Nvidia have delivered explosive growth in recent years, resulting in premium valuations. But with the latest pullback, investors finally have a rare chance to scoop up shares at far more reasonable prices. Given the long-term tailwinds behind mobile advertising for AppLovin and the surge of AI for Nvidia, this moment of market uncertainty could end up being a prime opportunity for investors who can look beyond the next few quarters and focus on the long term.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/2-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/?.tsrc=rss"

"2025-04-26 13:15:00";"Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Rigetti Computing vs. Nvidia";"Two popular stocks among tech investors lately areRigetti Computing(RGTI0.86%), which makes quantum computing hardware and software, and the semiconductor companyNvidia(NVDA4.11%). While Nvidia is a much more direct bet on the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market, Rigetti's quantum computing systems are integrated into some existing AI. Both stocks have soared, too, with Rigetti up 34% and Nvidia skyrocketing 342% over the past three years, compared to theS&P 500's 15% rise. But, which is the betterAI stockfor long-term investors? Let's take a look. Image source: Getty Images. If you're in the market for an AI stock, it's hard to beatNvidia. All major global tech companies have ramped up their data center spending over the past few years as they compete for artificial intelligence dominance. That's led to a bonanza of data center spending and rising demand for the processors in them. The result has been a boon for Nvidia's chip sales. Revenue from its data center segment soared 142% in fiscal 2025 to $115 billion, and the company's non-GAAP earnings soared 130% to $2.99 per share. It's also given Nvidia a massive lead in the AI data center processing space, with an estimated 70% to 95% market share. And the AI boom isn't over yet. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks tech companies will invest $2 trillion in AI data center spending over the next few years, which could lead to even more demand for Nvidia's advanced processors. The company is well-positioned to benefit from its latest AI processor, Blackwell, which has already spurred strong demand from tech giants and resulted in $11 billion in sales, the company's ""fastest product ramp."" Quantum computingoffers investors a compelling opportunity because the ramifications of the technology could advance everything from materials science to disease prevention and climate science. Unlike traditional computers, which process bits as either 0s or 1s, quantum computers use qubits, which can be either 0 or 1, or both simultaneously. That allows them to scale hypothetical scenarios much faster than traditional computers, although sometimes at the cost of making more mistakes. Rigetti makes hardware, software, and quantum cloud computing systems that tap into the massive potential of this market, which could be worth $170 billion by 2040. Rigetti's comprehensive approach to quantum computing is attractive to investors. It also partnered with some heavy hitters in the cloud space, includingAmazonandMicrosoft, giving Rigetti's tech real-world credibility (as opposed to theoretical applications that are often associated with quantum computing). But despite all of the interest in Rigetti, the company's recent financial results weren't impressive, considering sales fell 32% in the fourth quarter to just $2.3 million. That's not a good look for a young quantum computing company that's trying to carve out a niche in a speculative, new market. Rigetti's share price has soared 639% over the past year, giving its stock an expensive price-to-sales ratio of 147. Investors are now paying a premium for a company whose sales are falling and that's betting on an unproven market. There's no getting around the fact that all stocks are facing some uncertainty right now. President Trump's tariffs have left the market reeling, and many companies are scrambling to adjust to potential changes. Investors should be more cautious than in the recent past about the potential growth for any company, including Nvidia and Rigetti. But if you're looking for the better AI stock right now, Nvidia is it. Even if an economic slowdown arises from tariffs, Nvidia has a strong lead in the AI processor market, and tech giants are still clamoring for its chips. AI spending could slow a bit during a downturn, but the spigots won't likely turn off. Tech giants have too much at stake in their race for AI dominance to slow spending too much. As for Rigetti, I think the stock is simply too speculative. Sure, quantum computing holds a lot of promise, but it could still be years before most companies have real-world uses for the tech. Meanwhile, Rigetti's revenue is tumbling when it should be rising quickly, and its stock is expensive. All of which means it's probably best to leave Rigetti's shares alone right now.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/better-artificial-intelligence-rigetti-nvidia/?.tsrc=rss"
"2025-04-26 13:45:00";"Contrarian Opinion: Tariffs, Inflation, and Recession Fears Could Be a Tailwind for This Retail Stock and Propel It to a $1 Trillion Valuation";"Right now, there are only seven public companies that are trading at a market capitalization north of $1 trillion. The exclusive list of trillion-dollar stocks includesApple,Microsoft,Nvidia,Amazon,Alphabet,Meta Platforms, andBerkshire Hathaway. Beyond trillion-dollar stocks, the next three largest companies in the world as measured by market cap areBroadcom,Tesla, andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Do you see any themes here? With the exception of Berkshire, each trillion-dollar or near-trillion-dollar business dominates the technology sector. The next largest company after those referenced above is retail specialistWalmart(WMT-0.89%). With a market value of approximately $760 billion, Walmart is the most valuable non-pure-play technology business on the planet besides Berkshire. Image source: Getty Images. What's interesting is that each company valued higher than Walmart could be facing some unwelcome deceleration across their various businesses thanks in large part to newtariff policies. A common fear in the stock market right now is that tariffs could lead to higher prices (inflation) for consumer goods and raw materials, thereby sparking an economic slowdown (recession). As a contrarian, I think a tariff-induced slowdown could actually benefit Walmart. Let's explore why Walmart's business is ideally positioned to maneuver around any crises caused by tariffs. From there, I'll make the case for why Walmart could soon earn its entry into thetrillion-dollar club. Walmart is primarily known as abrick-and-mortarpowerhouse -- offering consumers a variety of goods across apparel, consumer electronics, produce, home remedies, and much more. While that might not sound too different from stores likeTargetorCVS, Walmart's main value proposition is its attractive prices. Cost-conscious shoppers tend to gravitate toward stores such as Walmart during periods underscored by rising prices or economic uncertainty. To back this idea up, let's take a look at some key performance indicators for the retail juggernaut over the last few years.  US Inflation Ratedata byYCharts The chart above illustrates trends seen in Walmart's revenue and gross profit, indexed against inflation rates over the last five years. In addition, I've included the brief (but important) COVID-19 recession -- as illustrated by the grey column on the left. Let's unpack what's happening here. Following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020, inflation levels started accelerating -- peaking at around 9% in mid-2022. During this period, Walmart's revenue and gross profit started to steadily climb. This is an impressive feat, considering many retailers were plagued by lower foot traffic during the pandemic. Not only are Walmart's prices one way to attract to consumers, but the company has also done a stellar job complementing its physical retail storefronts with ane-commercemarketplace of its own -- providing it with multiple avenues to monetize shoppers. Taking this a step further, let's analyze some important metrics retailers use to gauge the health of their business. During the fourth quarter of Walmart's fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 31), the company recognizedsame-store salesgrowth of 4.6%, while transactions rose by 2.8% and average ticket size grew by 1.8%. This means that Walmart is seeing more people come to its stores and spending more money while they are there. Although same-store sales, transaction volumes, andaverage order sizecan be variable in the retail space, I think any concerns related to this are mitigated by Walmart's ability to hold onto its shoppers. The big takeaway I gather from the chart above is that Walmart's revenue and gross profit continue to steadily rise, even as inflation levels have cooled over the last two years. I think ongoing economic uncertainty from tariffs could wind up being a tailwind for Walmart and its ability to lure consumers in and keep them part of its ecosystem in the long run. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, Walmart's earnings per share (EPS) totaled $2.42. Given the company's current share price of $95, Walmart stock trades for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 39. A $1 trillion market capitalization implies roughly a 32% increase Walmart's current valuation of $760 billion. This means in order to reach the trillion-dollar club, Walmart stock would need to be trading around $125 per share. If I assume that the company expands both its EPS and P/E ratio by 15%, that would imply future earnings of $2.81 and a P/E ratio of 45 for Walmart. In turn, this results in a future share price of about $126, which would put Walmart just above a trillion-dollar market capitalization. I think this level of EPS growth is attainable for Walmart, especially against the backdrop of a cloudy economic picture. The bigger question mark is whether investors will start applying a premium multiple to Walmart -- viewing it as a more essential player in the retail arena, all while giving the company credit for some of its higher-margin pursuits beyond brick-and-mortar sales. While the exercise above is rooted in simple math, I am cautiously optimistic that Walmart could emerge as a member of the trillion-dollar club sooner rather than later. Investors looking for opportunities that may be slightly more insulated from tariffs or economic slowdowns may want to consider a position in Walmart right now.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/contrarian-opinion-tariffs-inflation-and-recession/?.tsrc=rss"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket. AI (Artificial Intelligence) isn’t just a buzzword anymore—it’s becoming a part of our everyday lives, from the apps we use to how businesses operate. For investors, that means opportunity. As AI continues to grow, some companies are leading the charge and showing real potential for long-term gains. Whether you’re looking to diversify your portfolio or tap into the future of tech, this article will walk you through some of the best AI stocks worth watching right now. AI stocks saw incredible gains over the last couple of years, particularly in 2024, as AI applications burgeoned. The current weakness in AI stocks, caused by geopolitical tensions, may be a good opportunity to load up on AI stocks. In an interview with CNBC, the CEO and CIO of Ark Invest, Cathie Wood, underscored her bullishness on the AI sector despite the recent weakness in those stocks. According to Wood, AI has a massive runway. She compared the current AI position to the internet in the early to mid-90s. Wood is optimistic about robotaxis in the near term and the application of humanoid robots in the long term. However, the most under-appreciated application of AI, according to Wood, is healthcare, as AI will accelerate the curing of diseases. Within the medical application of AI, Cathie Wood is particularly bullish on sequencing technology, which is used to read DNA. AI is a great application in sequencing as it helps analyze, interpret, and act on that genetic data much quicker and more accurately than traditional methods. A segment within AI that is hot right now is Generative AI. Generative AI creates customized answers for the user based on real underlying data. Gen AI has created a massive investment cycle of over $200 billion annually, led by the ‘magnificent 7’. The tech behemoths are competing intensely over leadership in Gen AI. Meanwhile, an upcoming AI theme centers on how large language models (LLMs). According to Morgan Stanley, leading companies behind the most advanced LLMs are prioritizing high-performance chips and top-tier software to deliver AI solutions that are becoming essential for both businesses and consumers. While initial LLM use cases primarily included content creation, summarization, and categorization, industry leaders believe that the greatest yet-to-be-realized opportunity lies in applying AI reasoning to enterprise data. To compile the list of AI stocks that will skyrocket, we reviewed AI ETFs to compile a preliminary list of stocks and then selected the ones with the highest upside potential based on Wall Street analysts’ average price targets. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Note: All data was recorded on April 21, 2025. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

The tech giant’s innovations drive advancements in AI, data processing, scientific research, and 3D visualization, serving a wide range of industries. NVIDIA’s GPUs are essential for powering AI technologies, including deep learning in autonomous systems. More than 75% of the world’s leading supercomputers rely on its GPUs. In the gaming sector, NVIDIA enhances the experience for both gamers and content creators. It is also investing heavily in AI for self-driving vehicles. On April 16, Mizuho Securities maintained its “Outperform” rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a $168 price target, despite new US export restrictions affecting shipments of its H20 series products to China and other embargoed countries. These restrictions may impact around $5.5 billion in revenue from an estimated $16 billion in H20 orders. However, Mizuho analysts remain optimistic about NVIDIA’s near-term prospects, driven by the shipment of the GB200 series, increased GPU testing capacity, and significant capital investment in AI for 2026. With leadership in AI, data centers, and gaming, NVIDIA is well-positioned for long-term growth in multiple large markets, including AI and robotics. Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of AI stocks that will skyrocket. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks to watch ahead of May. Aswath Damodaran from NYU Stern School of Business said in a latest interview with CNBC that while investors are “celebrating” positive results of a few major tech companies, the problems haunting these firms will take a while to show up in their results. However, Damodaran, also known as ‘Dean of Valuation,’ said it won’t be prudent to “give up” entirely on Mag. 7 companies. “They can consolidate their advantage. In a weird way, again, all these troubles might play into the hands of the Mag 7, because the more troubles there are, the more flexibility gets rewarded. And as you pointed out, these companies are incredibly flexible, incredibly adaptable. We saw that with COVID, we saw that in 2022 with inflation, and I’m convinced you’re going to see it again. Doesn’t mean you load up on the Mag 7, but if you’ve never owned them, you had a chance to buy into at least one or two of them in the last month. You might have missed that chance, but the chance was there. So I wouldn’t give up that easily on the Mag 7.” Damodaran said investors experienced a lot of “trauma” in April. He argued against reactionary investing and said that when investors respond to daily events and news cycles, they damage their portfolios. “Maybe the best thing investors could have done is left at the start of the month, gone somewhere without internet service, and come back at the end of the month. Because everything we do is reactive, and often when you’re reacting to day-to-day events, you’re going to end up doing more damage to your portfolio than helping.” READ ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article, we picked 10 stocks Wall Street analysts are talking about as the chaotic month of April nears its close. With each stock, we have mentioned its latest hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Kevin Hincks from TD Ameritrade said in a program onSchwab Networkearlier in April that NVIDIA’s Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) demand remains strong “I think the Blackwell numbers for the fourth quarter last year were way better than expected. I think there’s still everyone, Tom, there’s no cracks in the demand story for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and chips in general. Everyone is confirming that demand is crazy. OpenAI just—or yeah, OpenAI ChatGPT—they just confirmed their demand is still strong. So I just think there’s so many things, and Tom, here’s my question that I used to say about Tesla a lot, now I say about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA): what’s in their pipeline? We know the Rubin chips are in their pipeline, and I’ll give investors, our viewers, one thought—what if they have a Palantir story, Tom? What if they take something that’s general to hyperscalers and make it for the general public? What if they start doing that? Think of what that could do to their demand, right? And so what’s the next generation of what NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is doing? Jensen Huang, really smart guy, is good at what he does. And so I think this is a sell-off with the rest of the market, a little bit heightened because of the popularity of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).” Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC’s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia’s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses  TSMC’s 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offer alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia’s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance due to several factors. In January 2025, investor concerns grew regarding the emergence of advanced AI models from China, reportedly developed at lower costs and with reduced computing requirements, raising doubts about Nvidia’s market dominance. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs targeting industries increased worries about higher operational costs. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia reported robust fiscal fourth-quarter results, highlighted by significant revenue growth driven by its data center segment. On the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the increasing computational requirements of future AI models, noting, “The more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer,” and adding that future reasoning models could demand substantially more compute resources. We believe Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure—including advancements in inference and reasoning during inference—continues to drive adoption among enterprises and startups, ensuring sustained demand for its high performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed and new clusters deployed, we see Nvidia as well-positioned to capitalize on rising computational needs across AI applications.” Overall, NVDAranks 3rdon our list of top stocks to watch ahead of May. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

"2025-04-26 18:25:00";"1 No-Brainer AI Stock Down 27% to Buy the Dip on Right Now (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)";"There's no question that 2025 has been a rough year for AI stocks thus far. Pressure from the trade war, high valuations in the sector, and signs that demand may be slowing have all weighed on these fast-growing stocks as nearly all are down year-to-date. As of April 25, theNasdaq Compositewas down 11% for the year, and in a bear market, according to some definitions. However, seasoned investors know that these sell-offs present buying opportunities, and one of the most attractive right now isTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.57%), which is trading down 27% from its peak earlier this year. Image source: Getty Images. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, often known as TSMC, is the world's biggest contract semiconductor, handling more than 50% of contract chip production in the world, and an estimated 90% of contract production for advanced chips. TSMC is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, and it's the company that tech titans likeApple,Nvidia,Broadcom,Advanced Micro Devices, andQualcomm, among others, making it a linchpin in the global technology supply chain. Because of its advanced chip-making capabilities, it's also a major player in artificial intelligence (AI). TSMC has delivered impressive growth through the AI era, and the company benefits from significant competitive advantages in capacity, expertise, technology, and customer relationships. In its recently released first-quarter earnings report, revenue jumped 41.6% to $25.5 billion even as the company dealt with the fallout from an earthquake in January, and operating income clocked in at $12.4 billion, giving it an operating margin of 48.5%. Management noted a sequential slowdown in smartphone demand due to seasonality, but said that AI-related demand continued to grow, driven by sales of 3nm and 5nm chips. It also said that tariff policies have not had an impact on customer behavior so far. Advanced chips, defined as 7nm or less, made up 73% of the company's revenue in the first quarter, showing its strength in advanced technologies. Additionally, 59% of its revenue came from high-performance computing, representing the kind of AI applications that partners like Nvidia turn to TSMC for. Based on the explosion in AI demand and TSMC's impressive revenue growth, it's clear that there's plenty of growth potential for the company, especially as demand for semiconductors should expand over the long term as semiconductors work their way into more products and the tech frontier pushes forward. Because of the need for semiconductors and concerns about geopolitical tensions around Taiwan, where the company is based, TSMC is building several new plants around the world, including in the U.S., where it's seen as an attractive manufacturing partner. TSMC was a big winner under the CHIPS Act passed under the Biden administration, and the Trump administration and TSMC recently announced that the company would invest $100 billion in the U.S. in chip manufacturing. If TSMC can geographically diversify its manufacturing base and adequately grow its capacity, the company's competitive advantages should become even stronger over the coming years. TSMC is a dominant tech company with a long runway of growth ahead of it and sustainable competitive advantages. However, the stock also trades at a surprisingly low valuation for a company of its stature at aprice-to-earnings ratioof just 21, meaning it trades at a discount to theS&P 500. That seems to reflect investor nervousness around geopolitical tensions in Taiwan, but it's in the interest of both the U.S. and China to avoid a military conflict around the island, and even during the trade war, there's been no hint of potential military aggression. Additionally, the semiconductor sector is cyclical, and it would be sensitive to a lasting trade war or a global recession. However, those risks seem to be more than priced in at the current valuation. Over the long term, given its growth potential, competitive advantages, and low valuation, TSMC looks like an easy winner.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/1-no-brainer-ai-stock-down-to-buy-the-dip-on-right/?.tsrc=rss"

"2025-04-27 07:45:00";"2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy With $2,000";"The stock market has gotten off to a rocky start this year, but market volatility is a small price to pay for the large gains of holding shares of a great business over many years. If you put your money in the right growth stocks, you can build wealth that lasts for generations. Consider thatCoca-Colahas been around since 1886, yet its stock is still hitting new highs in 2025. If you have $2,000 extra cash you don't need for other life priorities, putting that cash to work in shares of leadingartificial intelligence (AI)companies could be very rewarding over the next decade and beyond. The following AI stocks would make solid additions to a well-rounded portfolio of growth investments. Companies are in the process of investing substantial sums in AI.ServiceNow(NOW0.74%)is a leader provider of AI software that helps businesses streamline workflows and increase operating efficiency. It is used by leading companies, including the U.S. government, and it continues to see strong demand. The company just announced another quarter of strong growth that has the stock moving higher. ServiceNow's subscription revenue grew 19% year-over-year in Q1, exceeding expectations. Wall Street was fearful that uncertainty in the economy would weigh on near-term investment in software, but ServiceNow's momentum isn't slowing. It closed 72 deals over $1 million in net new annual contract value. It is positioning to be a leader in agentic AI. AI agents are super-intelligent assistants that can take a request by the user and complete a series of tasks to solve a problem. Demand for advanced AI features drove a 150% year-over-year increase in the number of deals for ServiceNow's Pro Plus AI offerings last quarter. ServiceNow also seems well positioned to benefit from potential new deals in its federal government business, where it has more than 1,700 federal and public sector customers. The Trump administration's goal to increase government efficiency certainly plays to ServiceNow's capabilities.Its U.S. public sector revenue grew over 30% year-over-year in Q1, including one new customer in the federal government. What's clear is that ServiceNow is emerging as a go-to solution for leading organizations wanting to use AI to improve productivity and modernize operations. The need to reduce costs and improve efficiency is becoming more urgent than ever. As each company adopts AI solutions, it leads to a domino effect where other companies are basically forced to adopt similar solutions to stay competitive. This is fueling ServiceNow's momentum. The stock popped 23% following its Q1 earnings results, but it's still trading more than 30% from its recent highs. Investors could split their $2,000 and buy one share of ServiceNow. Analysts are projecting the company'searningsto grow at an annualized rate of 30%, which could fuel handsome gains for investors over the next several years. The demand for AI software also fuels growth for leading suppliers of advanced computing chips. Training applications to solve problems without human input requires substantial investment in graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI training, andNvidia's(NVDA4.11%)GPUs are the gold standard. Nvidia has been the leader in GPUs for many years. As the leading supplier of very pricey chips, it is a highly profitable business, with $73 billion in trailing-12-month net income. It has growing resources to invest in innovation to remain the leader for years to come. Nvidia's chips were the popular choice the past few years that helped train the AI for OpenAI's ChatGPT and other popular AI models. Cloud giants likeAmazonWeb Services and Google Cloud are some of Nvidia's top customers. Nvidia's new Blackwell chips are in high demand, with analysts expecting the company's revenue to increase 55% to $201 billion this year. Annual spending ondata centerinfrastructure, which is Nvidia's largest addressable market, is expected to reach $1 trillion in the coming years, according to Dell'Oro Group. But CEO Jensen Huang believes that the market for GPU-based computing systems could be hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars. That's based on the idea that every company and industry will one day run on AI. Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to grow more than 35% per year over the next several years. Yet investors can currently buy the shares for 22 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. That's modest for a company growing at these rates. Investors who split their money between ServiceNow andNvidiawill own shares of two dominant AI companies on the software and hardware side and will be in a great position to profit from the growth of AI.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/2-artificial-intelligence-stocks-to-buy-with-2000/?.tsrc=rss"
"2025-04-27 08:29:00";"Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar After May 1";"Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)has been taking a beating so far this year. Shares have plunged nearly 30% year to date as of this writing. Yet the stock is stillhigherby more than 27% over the past 12 months. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader remains one of thelargest companies by market cap, valued at about $2.4 trillion. The question for investors is whether Nvidia stock can regain its momentum and return the company to a valuation of $3 trillion or beyond. I believe it can, and I think one key date to watch is coming up on May 1. The decline in Nvidia shares in recent months has had several forces behind it. Most obvious was the stock's more than 800% return over the two-year period ending Dec. 31, 2024. It's natural for some investors to want to protect those gains. Trying to time stock prices can be hazardous to one's financial health, though. Long-term investments are better left untouched if the company's underlying business prospects remain strong. That brings us to another headwind for Nvidia stock. Uncertainty related to tariffs and general demand for AI infrastructure. The company was recently forced to take a $5.5 billion charge as the U.S. government placed indefinite restrictions on its H20 chip sales to China. Those chips were specifically designed for the Chinese market, and that business will inevitably be filled by other, potentially domestic, Chinesechip suppliers. Image source: Getty Images. While China sales are important for Nvidia, they only represented about 13% of total revenue in fiscal year 2025. More critical is the trajectory of demand for its AI products frommajor tech companieslikeMicrosoft,Amazon, and others. That is also now coming into question. Recent reports have reiterated aWells Fargoanalyst note saying that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has delayed prior plans fornew data center leases. Microsoft, another large cloud infrastructure provider, has made similar decisions to slow data center expansion, according to the analysts. That comes after plans to aggressively expand cloud infrastructure capacity with hundreds of billions of dollars in capital spending for Nvidia'sGPU hardwarehad been announced by several companies. Others, including xAI andMeta, appear to be continuing with growth plans. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had previously toldCNBCthat he didn't expect to cut back on capital spending for data center compute capacity. That's why investors need to mark May 1 on their calendars. Amazon is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on that date. Microsoft will be providing its quarterly update the day prior. Amazon AWS vice president of global data centers Kevin Miller called any modification in plans ""routine capacity management."" If the companies reiterate that capital spending plans are basically on track, investors could pour back into Nvidia stock after its recent plunge. Nvidia'sprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratiois now near a three-year low based on current fiscal year earnings estimates.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts The long-term growth of AI doesn't look to be hitting a wall. Enterprises, as well as consumers, should increase use. And Nvidia isn't just making money on AI hardware. It has robust software architecture offerings that companies are buying. It also has a fast-growing robotics and assisted driving segment. Business spending could fluctuate. An economic slowdown or even recession could delay the pace of AI expansion. In the end, though, Nvidia remains the sector leader. I suspect long-term investors will look back on its recent stock price as a fine investment opportunity.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/prediction-nvidia-stock-will-soar-after-may-1/?.tsrc=rss"
"2025-04-27 08:49:00";"Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 3 Years?";"Since the beginning of 2023,Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)has added more than $2.2 trillion to its market capitalization on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Demand is through the roof for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the gold standard for developing AI models. Nvidia's customers include some of the world's biggest technology companies, which are battling for AI supremacy, includingMicrosoft,Amazon,Meta Platforms, andAlphabet.These four companies are forecast to spend a record amount of money on data center infrastructure during 2025. But according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, that spending will increase significantly every year for the foreseeable future, and cross an important milestone in 2028. The company continues to launch new chips to maintain its edge over the competition, so here's where its stock could be in three years. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia's H100 data centerGPUdominated the industry in 2023 and for most of 2024. It was based on the company's Hopper architecture, which has since been superseded by Blackwell and, more recently, Blackwell Ultra. The upcoming Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU can deliver up to 50 times more performance than the H100 in certain configurations, because it was designed for next-generationAI models, which are capable of ""reasoning."" In the past, chatbots likeOpenAI'sChatGPT would quickly render one-shot responses to users' queries, which made them convenient, but they occasionally blurted out inaccurate information. Reasoning models spend more time thinking and correcting potential errors in the background in order to deliver more polished responses. While this is a great step forward for the AI industry, it does create some new challenges. Huang says reasoning models require a staggering 100 times more computing power than their predecessors for two reasons. First, they consume 10 times more tokens than traditionallarge language models(LLMs) because of all the thinking that goes on in the background. Second, they are much slower to render responses, which means GPUs need to be up to 10 times more powerful to offset the delays, or else AI will lose the convenience factor that people have grown to love. That's why new chips based on the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra architectures are in such high demand. The four Nvidia customers I mentioned at the top -- Microsoft,Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet -- have told investors they plan to spend over $300 billion (combined) on data center infrastructure and chips this year, which would be a record. That doesn't include other big spenders like OpenAI,Tesla, orOracle. But Huang thinks this is just the beginning, because three years from now in 2028, he predicts data center spending will top $1 trillion annually, which would be a monumental tailwind for Nvidia's business. Nvidia generated a record $130.5 billion in totalrevenueduring its fiscal year 2025 (which ended Jan. 26). The data center segment accounted for $115.2 billion of that figure, which represented a whopping 142% increase from the prior year, highlighting how quickly GPU demand is growing. Nvidia's soaring top line also drove a significant increase in profits, with the company'searnings per share(EPS) soaring by 130% to $2.99 in fiscal 2025. That places its stock at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof just 36, which is a 39% discount to its 10-year average of 59.6. But the stock looks even cheaper on a forward basis. Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Nvidia will deliver $4.42 in EPS during the current fiscal year 2026, placing its stock at aforward P/E ratioof 23.9: NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts. In other words, Nvidia stock would have to soar by around 149% over the next 12 months just to trade in line with its 10-year average P/E ratio of 59.6, implying a price of $263 per share. But even if its P/E ratio remains at 36 instead, the stock could still top $200 in fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027) based on Wall Street's earnings forecast for that year. Therefore, as long as Nvidia maintainssomeannual earnings growth after that, its stock should be trading well beyond $200 in calendar year 2028. Considering that's the year Huang is forecasting $1 trillion in data center spending, the company should have no problem generating more earnings. The reason Nvidia's P/E ratio looks so attractive right now is because its stock is down 29% from its all-time high amid thesimmering global trade tensions, which threaten to dampen economic growth in the near term. Some of Nvidia's top customers might be forced to temporarily pull back on their data center investments if they suffer a slowdown in their core businesses, which would reduce demand for GPUs and dent the company's earnings potential. However, AI is shaping up to be a long-term boom, and the industry can't move forward without the hardware supplied by companies like Nvidia. Therefore, investors who buy Nvidia stock todaymight have to weather some volatilitywhile the U.S. negotiates new trade deals with other countries, but they could do extremely well if they put the short-term noise aside and stay focused on the years ahead.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/where-will-nvidia-stock-be-in-3-years/?.tsrc=rss"
"2025-04-27 09:51:00";"Prediction: This Stock Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple 5 Years From Now";"Two companies have sat at or near the top of the list of the world's most valuable companies for the better part of a decade:Apple(AAPL0.41%)andMicrosoft(MSFT1.21%). The longtime tech giants were recently joined at the top of the list byNvidia(NVDA4.11%), which has skyrocketed in value as demand for its market-leading GPUs soared. All three of these companies have, at one time or another, surpassed a market valuation of $3 trillion, although Apple is the only one hanging onto that milestone at the moment. Meanwhile, there's a clear gap between the three giants in the market and the next group of mega-cap stocks. But there's one company that could join and even surpass Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple's valuation over the next five years, and its stock looks like an incredible value right now. Image source: Getty Images. The appeal of a company like Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia, which have come to completely dominate certain markets like smartphones, PC operating systems and enterprise productivity software, andGPUsis clear. But a company that dominates multiple industries can be even more appealing. Especially if those industries have strong growth potential. That's whyAmazon(AMZN1.35%)looks like such a great opportunity for investors right now. Amazon holds a dominant position ine-commerce. It's the market leader incloud computing. It's one of the largest digital advertising channels, and it's growing quickly. And it has several additional growth opportunities ahead. Amazon got to this point by being willing to sacrifice in the short-term for long-term potential gain. And that gain started to come to fruition in the last few years. That's evidenced by its massive free cash flow growth and expanding operating margin. Amazon set new records for both in 2024, generating $32.9 billion in free cash flow with a 10.75% operating margin. Importantly, Amazon has seen improvements in profitability across all of its businesses. North American retail saw its operating margin expand to 6.4% last year from 4.2% last year. Its international segment turned positive last year as well, generating operating margin of 2.7% versus -2% in 2023. And Amazon Web Services generated a massive operating margin of 37% in 2024 versus 27% in 2023. That margin expansion should continue in 2025. Amazon spent the last two years revamping its logistics network in the United States to reduce costs and improve delivery times. It's gone from a heavy investment cycle and it's now capitalizing on that investment with improved profitability. Amazon's high-margin advertising business is also wrapped up in its retail business. That's poised to grow quickly as it expands advertising inventory with more video ads in Prime Video and its marketplace. Meanwhile, Amazon has committed to spending heavily on Amazon Web Services in 2025 to meet the growing demand for AI services. But its spending ahead of forecasted demand. Management said it remained capacity constrained in 2024, so it expects significant revenue growth in 2025 as it builds out more data centers for AWS. Despite the massive spending on AWS, the improved profitability should produce continued growth in free cash flow over time. Amazon has never been afraid to expand into new opportunities when it sees them. And there are two big opportunities where the company can leverage its massive infrastructure to provide services few others can compete with. The first big opportunity is in the continued growth of artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon can benefit not just from a raw compute perspective, but from additional services that can help enterprises make the most oflarge language models. It introduced Amazon Bedrock to help customers leverage the foundation models of others, customized with a customers' own data, to build new AI applications. Its also building its own AI applications for consumers, and providing frameworks for businesses to easily develop their own applications or internal AI agents. This likely is still the early innings of AI development, and Amazon is positioned to be one of the big winners from continued growth. The other opportunity is in logistics. Amazon has built an extensive network of fulfillment centers and warehouses throughout the country. Amazon shipped more packages than any other carrier in the United States in 2022. As mentioned it recently revamped its system to maximize the efficiency of the massive network. Amazon offers limited services for merchants outside of its marketplace, but it could launch its own logistics service for third parties in the future, andits a big opportunity. Considering Amazon could mostly leverage existing infrastructure and systems, the incremental profits from logistics services could be another major growth lever for the business. With multiple leading positions in several fast-growing markets and new opportunities ahead, it may be only a matter of time before Amazon overtakes Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock currently looks relatively undervalued. Its forward PE sits around 29.5 as of this writing. While that's higher than the three biggest companies in the market, it's relatively low for Amazon. That's especially true if youcompare Amazon to other retailers right nowor its historic PE ratio. Moreover, Amazon is charting a path to grow its free cash flow significantly over the next few years as AWS scales and its retail operations become more profitable. By 2030, the company could easily surpass $100 billion in annual free cash flow. (It's worth noting, analysts previously thought Amazon would reach that level by next year, but Amazon's plans to spend $100 billion on capex this year and greater economic uncertainty have reduced those estimates.) With a 2% free cash flow yield, that would put its valuation at $5 trillion, a 2.5% yield would put it at $4 trillion. Even if Amazon doesn't overtake Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple by then, that still presents an appealing opportunity with a current market valuation less than $2 trillion.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/prediction-this-stock-will-be-worth-more-than-nvid/?.tsrc=rss"

Meta Platform's scheduled report for the same day comes as the Instagram parent is embroiled in a Federal Trade Commissionantitrust court case. Coca-Cola’s earnings on Tuesday come as the soda maker’s global business is still exposed to trade barriers, though analysts at JPMorgan said thecompany is well-positionedto weather economic uncertainty from tariffs. McDonald's' scheduled report on Thursday will also provide insight into the health of the U.S. consumer, while General Motors' scheduled report comes amid questions over howtariffs are affecting automakers. Visa’s report on Tuesday comes as the credit card issuer is reportedly bidding to take over the role ofApple’s credit card payment network. Other financial firms scheduled to report this week include Mastercard, HSBC Holdings, UBS, and PayPal. Cryptocurrency investors will be following Thursday’s report from Strategy (MSTR), the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, coming after the bitcoin buyer reportedwider-than-expected lossesin the prior quarter. Several pharmaceutical firms are on the weekly reporting calendar, including AstraZeneca, Novartis, and Pfizer on Tuesday, followed by Eli Lilly and Amgen on Thursday.  Energy will be in focus on Friday with ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell all scheduled to deliver earnings. Exxon has already warned that lower oil prices could result in ahit to its earnings. Other noteworthy earnings scheduled for this week include Starbucks and United Parcel Service on Tuesday, Caterpillar on Wednesday and Airbnb on Thursday. Trump's 100th day in office, the April jobs report, and the latest inflation data are all on the calendar this week as investors look for the impact of tariff policy to begin toshow in economic indicators. Friday’s scheduled release of the employment report comes as the jobs market hasremained resilientamid the uncertainty surrounding tariff policies. March’s report showed a surprising jump in job creation even though the unemployment rate moved slightly higher. Investors will also be watching the private sector payrolls report from ADP and job openings data scheduled for earlier in the week. ThePersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)report for March comes after the Fed’s preferred inflation readingcame in as expected in February, while inflation remained above the central bank’s target rate of 2%. The jobs and inflation data will be closely followed by the Federal Reserve ahead of its upcoming meeting on May 6-7,coming as Trump has increased pressure on Chair Jerome Powell over thecentral bank’s interest rate policy. Fed officials are in the commentary blackout period ahead of the meeting. On Wednesday, market watchers will get their first look at how the broad economy performed in the first quarter, with the scheduled release of U.S. gross domestic product data. Theeconomy grew less-than-expectedin last year’s final quarter. Consumer confidence data on Tuesday comes as economists watch how the public reacts to the uncertainty surrounding trade policy. Tuesday’s expected advanced trade balance report will shed more light on the early impact that tariffs are having on U.S. imports and exports. Investors will also be watching for fresh housing data, including the home price index for February and pending home sales for March.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-the-markets-this-week-april-28-2025-11721321"
"2025-04-27 10:21:00";"2 Bargain Stocks You Can't Afford to Miss Out on During the Stock Market Sell-Off";"Even though the market has slightly recovered from the lows it experienced not long ago, it's still well off its all-time highs. Despite this, there are plenty of bargains to be found in the market. Two that I'm most excited about areTaiwan Semiconductor(TSM0.57%)andThe Trade Desk(TTD1.33%). Although they operate in completely different industries, they will be OK over the long term. Taiwan Semi is the leading contract chip manufacturer and has contracts with many of the largest tech companies around the globe. Companies likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)andNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)don't have chip production capabilities; they just handle end assembly of their chips. Instead, they source their chips from Taiwan Semi, which acts as a fabrication facility. While there may be some concerns with TSMC's geographical location outside the U.S. andpotential exposure to tariffs, there are no tariffs on semiconductors right now. However, the Trump administration has stated that one will come soon. Taiwan Semiconductor is already taking steps to sidestep these tariffs by building facilities in the U.S. In addition to the $65 billion facility already built in Arizona, Taiwan Semi announced a $100 billion investment to stand up six new facilities in the U.S. However, those facilities will take some time, which leaves TSMC on the hook if semiconductor tariffs are eventually implemented. However, the fear of tariffs didn't stop Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO from stating: We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies. However, we have not seen any change in our customers' behavior so far. Therefore, we continue to expect our full year 2025 revenue to increase by close to mid-20s percent in U.S. dollar terms. That's bullish news for investors, yet the stock has barely budged after that announcement.  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At 17 times forward earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is a steal at these levels, and investors should use this market-wide weakness as their opportunity to scoop up the top player in the chip production industry. The market is valuing TSMC's stock like it will lose substantial business, yet management is stating the exact opposite. The Trade Desk has been hit by two sell-offs in 2025: one from the broader market and the other from a bad earnings report. In the fourth quarter, The Trade Desk missed revenue expectations for the first time in company history, which caused the stock to sell off by more than 30% the next day. This occurred in mid-February, which was right before the broader market sell-off began. These two events compounded each other, which is why The Trade Desk's stock is down around 65% from its all-time high. However, this is a very shortsighted reaction. The Trade Desk is one of the most dominant companies in the digital advertising space. It helps ad buyers (those with a product or service to sell) find the most opportune spaces to place their ads on the Internet. This can range from the margins of a website to connected TV to podcast ads. Targeted ads are the most effective form of advertising, and using AI to power that feature is key to success. The Trade Desk has been urging clients to migrate from its old offering to the new AI-powered platform, and the company largely wrapped up that process in Q4. This is what caused the revenue miss, as The Trade Desk prioritized long-term customer relationships rather than short-term revenue. This will pay off over the next few years, but the market really only cares about the next few months. The digital media space still has a massive growth runway, and The Trade Desk is primed to benefit from this migration. But after the sell-off, all the optimism in The Trade Desk's stock seems gone.  TTD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Thought 28 times forward earnings may not seem like a bargain compared to other stocks in the market (like Taiwan Semiconductor), the company's dominance in this growing industry can't be ignored. As a result, I think investors should be taking advantage of themarket's sale price on The Trade Desk's stock.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/2-bargain-stocks-you-cant-afford-to-miss-out-on-du/?.tsrc=rss"
"2025-04-27 10:45:00";"3 Growth Stocks Down 30% or More to Buy Right Now";"Pinpointing strong bargains in the stock market is key to success, and the market is full of them right now. While some may be concerned about tariff effects in the short term, most of these stocks have incredibly bright long-term outlooks. By shifting your focus from the next few months to the next few years, you can ignore some of today's events, and it will be obvious which stocks are great buys now. Three companies that are down more than 30% from their all-time highs and look like excellent buys areNvidia(NVDA4.11%),Taiwan Semiconductor(TSM0.57%), andASML(ASML0.38%). These three also represent a great picture of the AI chip value chain, and as long as AI continues to be an area where businesses invest, these three will succeed. As a quick overview of the supply chain, Nvidia places Taiwan Semiconductor's chips in itsGPUs (graphics processing units), which have been the primary computing unit deployed by the AI hyperscalers. To make these chips, Taiwan Semiconductor needs specialized machines from ASML known as extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography machines. No company in the world has EUV technology besides ASML, so its engineering dominance has earned it a technological monopoly. As the demand for Nvidia GPUs rises, so does the need for more Taiwan Semi chips. Increased chip demand requires more production capacity, which means more ASML EUV machines. Again, this requires AI demand to continue rising, which seems to be the way that it's heading. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated at its 2025 GTC event that data center buildouts will increase from about $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. Considering that Nvidia's trailing 12-month total data center revenue was $115 billion, it gets nearly a third of all data center spending. That's a huge chunk of the market, and if Nvidia can maintain that percentage, it will deliver monster growth over the next few years. This also jives with what Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO, C.C. Wei, has been saying. For 2025, they expect revenue from their AI-related chips to double. Additionally, over the next five years, they expect AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compounded annual growth rate, which would be an incredible achievement. While investors can speculate whether these projections are valid, the reality is that these two CEOs are better connected to the demand than almost anybody else. While they can still make mistakes, the odds of getting this information completely wrong are unlikely. As a result, investors need to take refuge in the fact that there is still a massive AI buildout going on, and this trend will be unlikely to be disrupted over the next five years unless a severe economic collapse occurs. I don't think that's likely, which makes these three stocks intriguing considering their sale prices. While these stocks used to be highly valued, they aren't that way anymore following the sell-off.  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts ASML is the most expensive stock on the list at 24.4 times forward earnings, but those projections don't include ASML's recently announced plan to repurchase up to 10% of its stock. This could be a huge boost for the stock, making it even cheaper than it currently appears. Nvidia at 23 times forward earnings is a no-brainer, as the growth it's expected to achieve over the next few years is quite impressive. Lastly, Taiwan Semiconductor is a steal at these levels because the broader market (as measured by theS&P 500(^GSPC0.74%)) trades for 19.8 times forward earnings. TSMC is expecting market-beating growth over the next five years, so buying it at a discount to the market is a great investment opportunity. These three may be hurting, but the long-term outlook is still clear. All three of these stocks look like excellent bargains, andinvestors should scoop them up while they're still cheap.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/3-growth-stocks-down-30-or-more-to-buy-right-now/?.tsrc=rss"

All of the 20 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have issued “buy” or equivalent ratings for the stock, which has lost 7% so far in 2025. Their consensus price target slightly above $492 would suggest over 25% upside from Friday’s closing price of $391.85. Wedbush analysts recently lowered their price target to $475 from $550 amid worries aboutPresident Trump's tariffs, but said they ""remain long term bullish"" on Microsoft, pointing to its AI potential. ""It has become crystal clear to us that the monetization opportunities around deploying AI in the cloud is a transformational opportunity across the industry with Redmond remaining in the driver's seat,"" they said. Goldman Sachs analysts, who similarly maintained a ""buy"" rating for Microsoft but lowered their price target to $450 from $500, said the current economic environment has created a ""wide range of different outcomes,"" but that they believe Microsoft could be ""well positioned to capitalize"" on AI opportunities. Morningstar analystssaidMicrosoft could also be in a stronger position than many other tech companies, because it ""has minimal risk exposure to retail, advertising spending, cyclical hardware, or physical supply chains."" Analysts polled by Visible Alpha on average expect Microsoft to report third-quarter revenue of $68.44 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year, and net income of $23.94 billion, or $3.21 per share, compared to $21.94 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier.

Latest reports from the IMF reveal that economic gains from artificial intelligence are likely to outweigh the costs of rising carbon emissions from the data centers needed to run AI models. The report, released at the IMF’s annual spring meeting in Washington, revealed how artificial intelligence is going to boost global output by around 0.5% a year between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, it also noted how these output gains will not be shared equally worldwide. READ NOW:Top 10 AI Stocks Making Headlines TodayandTop 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week ""Despite challenges related to higher electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions, the gains to global GDP from AI are likely to outweigh the cost of the additional emissions. The social cost of these extra emissions is minor compared with the expected economic gains from AI, yet it still adds to the worrisome buildup of emissions”. Considering that energy policies remain the same and artificial intelligence use becomes widespread, greenhouse gas emissions will see a cumulative global increase of 1.2% between 2025 and 2030. However, a switch to greener energy policies would limit the increase to 1.3 Gt. Quantifying the social cost of these emissions, the report calculated that the extra cost is likely to be at $50.7-$66.3 billion, which is smaller than the income gains that can help boost the economy by 0.5% each year through AI. According to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, AI may even be able to generate an overall reduction in carbon emissions if it accelerates advances in low-carbon technologies in the power, food, and transport sectors. ""But market forces alone are unlikely to successfully drive AI's application toward climate action.

"2025-04-27 13:00:00";"Big Tech’s Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High";"(Bloomberg) -- The last time Big Tech delivered earnings, Donald Trump had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors’ main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits. Most Read from Bloomberg Why Car YouTuber Matt Farah Is Fighting for Walkable Cities Newsom Says California Is Now the World’s Fourth-Biggest Economy At Bryn Mawr, a Monumental Plaza Traces the Steps of Black History Backyard Micro-Flats Aim to Ease South Africa’s Housing Crisis Los Angeles Downgraded to AA- by S&P Due to Budget Woes Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture. This week’s quarterly results from Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that’s wiped $5.5 trillion from the S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap. Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn’t giving the companies’ estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven — which also includes Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions. That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks’ share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster fears of muted corporate spending ahead. “Any modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,” said Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year’s weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity. Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its worst quarter in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive Elon Musk intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet beat expectations but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 index jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it’s still down 15% in 2025. Profits and Spending A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams. Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders — Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta — are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft’s sudden decision to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures. Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. That said, there’s little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty. American Airlines Group Inc. and Skechers USA Inc. are among companies that have abandoned forecasts this quarter. Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters. “I think the more experienced management aren’t even going to try,” he said. A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants’ dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies — even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trump said a deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs he’s posted on Chinese goods. But for Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, it all comes down to the denominator in the price-to-earnings ratio. “The valuations are getting more interesting down here, but we haven’t pulled the trigger yet,” he said. “There are a lot of questions on the E-side of the equation.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek As More Women Lift Weights, Gyms Might Never Be the Same Why US Men Think College Isn’t Worth It Anymore Eight Charts Show Men Are Falling Behind, From Classrooms to Careers The Mastermind of the Yellowstone Universe Isn’t Done Yet Healthy Sodas Like Poppi, Olipop Are Drawing PepsiCo’s and Coca-Cola’s Attention ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.";"News";"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-problem-estimates-130000512.html?.tsrc=rss"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best safe stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In times when you never know what you’ll wake up to the next morning, playing safe seems to be the wisest choice. Amid consistent market shifts and global uncertainties, it’s difficult not to lean towards reliability. With rising global recession risks and political uncertainties, protecting the capital has become a priority for many. As Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, once said, “The idea of investing in a company just because it’s safe is not necessarily a good idea. But it’s a much better idea than investing in something that is clearly risky.” If we think about a “safe” stock, a low-risk stock usually comes to our mind. While it’s true, there is even more to it. A safe stock generally stems from a well-established company possessing a strong balance sheet, a track record of decent performance, solid market positioning, and a dividend history. So, when looking for a safe stock, it’s important to look for not one, not two, but all of these metrics. In its entirety, these are usually “blue chip stocks” that are market leaders in the industries they operate. Hedge funds, recognized for their strategies and in-depth market understanding, have long advocated for such stocks for their reliability and resilience. These managers carefully study the market trends and then weigh in on businesses that are deemed to deliver both value and predictability. As reported by Reuters, hedge funds are fleeing the stocks of companies that are providing what customers want, and what they don’t need. As the signs of a global recession are becoming more and more evident, hedge funds are dumping their positions in consumer discretionary. “Hedge funds dumping consumer discretionary stocks strongly suggests they’re bracing for economic trouble, likely a recession,” mentioned Bruno Schneller, the Managing Director at Erlen Capital Management. Similarly, a Goldman Sachs report, comparing the gains by Hedge Fund VIP basket and the broader market, indicates that the top 50 stocks preferred by hedge funds have collectively returned 10% in 2025 relative to the market’s 3% gain. In a “Low-Risk Stocks Outperform within All Observable Markets of the World” paper by Nardin Baker and Robert Haugen, the differences in performance by low-volatility stocks and high-volatility stocks in developed and emerging equity markets worldwide were compared. The results revealed that stocks with low realized volatility exhibit higher future returns at lower risk than stocks with relatively higher realized volatility, thus contradicting the traditional inference that attributes higher returns to higher risks. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best safe stocks to consider. In compiling a list of the 11 best safe stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of Q4 2024, and picked mega-cap stocks with positive five-year returns and next-year revenue growth. All of these factors are considered to ensure that the stocks selected yield low volatility and high safety. In addition, we also considered stocks that pay dividends to shareholders to ensure safety and reliability. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the hedge funds having stakes in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

A pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing, the company is igniting modern AI and serving globally leading companies like Meta Platforms. NVDA has been almost everyone’s favorite stock for the past few years. Nothing but exceptional, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is leading the market due to its innovation and technological semiconductor superiority. With the market tossing and turning, investors are valuing stocks that ought to rebound strongly, and that’s what NVDA is. When it can thrive as a fledgling start-up offering graphics cards, which sparked a heated and cyclical race, becoming a graveyard to many, we believe NVDA can survive anything. The company has strategically prepared a three-year plan. Coupled with the Hopper series, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is going to focus on Blackwell GB200, Blackwell NV36 and NV72, and Blackwell Ultra (Blackwell 300), each with its own offering, during FY25-26.
