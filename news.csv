Stocks on theNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE)on Thursday completed aZweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT), which is realized when the share of rising stocks increases from a moving average of less than 40% to more than 61.5% within a 10-day period. The rare occurrence, which has only been seen 19 times in the last 80 years, is considered a sign of increasing market momentum driven by broad bullishsentiment. ""This signal has been 100% accurate since WWII, with theS&P 500higher 6- and 12-months later every single time,"" according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group.Looking at the last 19 ZBT signals, the S&P 500 has averaged a 6-monthreturnof 14.8% and a 1-year return of 23.4%, according to Detrick. Stocks have rebounded from their""Liberation Day"" slumpamid optimism that the White House iseager to defuse tensionswith China, which the administration has slapped with tariffs totaling 145% this year. The S&P 500 wasup slightly on Fridayafter rising more than 1.5% in each of the last three sessions. Not everyone is sold on ZBT’s predictive power.Technical analystTom McClellan, in 2015, examined Breadth Thrusts between 1929 and 1934 and found them to be much less reliable bullish signals. The first signal in this period came in November 1930, and it did precede a strong upswing. ""But its bullish effect petered out after just a few months, and the bear market was back on,"" McClellan wrote. Over the next two years, four more Breadth Thrusts failed to break thebear market.

Hint: It's More Than What's in Fort Knox";"Collectively, families across India have almost 25,000 tonnes of gold, making them the highest private owners of gold in the world. To put it in perspective, Indian families have a gold stash almost six times greater than the gold stored in Fort Knox. Gold serves various purposes in India. It is collected and kept as afinancial shieldshould economic turmoil arise, it is given as a gift at celebrations, and in rural areas, it takes the place of banking. As part of the cultural fabric, women collect gold jewelry, which is seen as a symbol of wealth, and it is often passed down from one generation to the next. And atweddings, gold jewelry is given to the bride, and gold bars are presented to the happy couple. Despite its importance in Indian life, there are restrictions on how much gold individuals can hold. According toincome taxlaws in India, married women are allowed to hold as much as 500 grams of gold. For unmarried women, this amount is lower, at 250 grams. Indian men may only hold up to 100 grams of gold. The total discovered gold in human history. In addition to its cultural importance in India, gold serves as a financial investment worldwide. It is often seen as an economic hedge when markets tumble. The price of gold as of April 25, 2025, is $3,305.70 per ounce. This is up from $2,331.71 per ounce in April 2024. Gold has been a solidinvestmentover the past 17 years. In April 2008, the price of gold was $1,354.54 per ounce, a triple-digit increase compared with today's price. However, gold is also a highly speculative asset with volatile price shifts and doesn't provide interest or dividends. Owning physical gold also comes with security and storage demands. Beyond owning bars or jewelry, gold investments can include exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks in gold mining operations. Indian families, particularly Indian women, are large holders of gold. This precious metal has a significant cultural meaning for Indian people, as they gift gold at weddings and pass it down from generation to generation. Gold also serves as a financial means of protection in difficult economic times, as it does throughout the rest of the world.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/amount-of-indian-familys-gold-holdings-11703898"

Alphabet reiterated its plans to spend$75 billionin capital expenditures this year, most of which is expected to go toward building out the company's AI infrastructure. Alphabet shares were up 1.8% at around $162 in late trading, as several analysts raised their price targets for the stock after the strong earnings report. Despite gains over the past week, the stock is 15% lower since the start of the year, due in part to worries over whether the company’s significant investment in AI infrastructure will pay off. Below, we analyze thetechnicalson Alphabet’s chart and identify crucial price levels that investors will likely be watching. Alphabet shares have trended lower within adescending channelthroughout most of this year, with the50-day moving average (MA)recently crossing below the 200-day MA to form an ominousdeath cross, a chart pattern that signal lower prices.

The first area to monitor sits at $168. This location on the chart may provide overheadresistancenear a trendline that links multiplepeaks and troughson the chart extending back to late July last year.

The stock gained 18% this week, easily its best week this year and its biggest weekly gain since rising nearly 30% the weekDonald Trump was re-elected. Shares rose more than 4.5% on Tuesday amid a broad stock rally driven by optimism that the Trump administrationwill lower the steep tariff ratesit imposed earlier this month. The stock's ascent picked up pace on Wednesday after Musk assured investors that, starting in May, he wouldspend less timeleading President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, a position that investors worry has bothdistracted Muskanddamaged Tesla’s brand. Musk’s decision to re-focus on Tesla offset otherwisebleak quarterly results. The electric vehicle maker reported a 20% decline in automotive revenue, narrower margins, and a nearly 40% decline in adjusted earnings. It also declined to issue full-year guidance in light of the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the overall economic outlook. In the near term, the company faces a bumpy road, with tariffs expected to drive up manufacturing costs and, in the event of a recession, curb consumer spending. The company could also struggle to shake its association with President Trump, whose unpopularity abroad has contributed toa sharp dropin Tesla sales even as total EV sales have risen. Analysts at several firms, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, lowered their estimates of Tesla’s full-year earnings after Tuesday’s disappointing numbers. At the same time, severalleft their price targets unchanged, reflecting Wall Street’s faith in Tesla’s ability to overcome near-term headwinds. Musk has said Tesla’s value—he has forecast it will be “the most valuable company in the worldand probably by a long shot”—has as much, if not more, to do with its development of AI, autonomous driving, and robotics than the electric vehicles that account for the bulk of its revenue today.

Oppenheimer said its bullish estimate could prove to be too aggressive if the console-refresh cycle fails to meet investor expectations over the next few years, if sales of older games fall at a higher rate than their replacements' growth, or if EA can't continue to tightly manage itsoperating expenses. “While EA enjoys successful evergreen [video game] properties like Madden NFL and FIFA, future growth will suffer if consumer perception of microtransactions turns negative,” the report also said.

Giventhe economic rollercoaster triggeredby President Trump's continually evolving tariff policy, boosting the cash you have in reserve seems wise. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or shifting funds from stocks into cash vehicles, it's important to consider how much you can earn from different strategies. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, indicating the change from a week ago. Right now you can earn the highest rate with ahigh-yield savings account, with two options paying 5.00%. However, those two leaders have some special requirements that might not suit your needs, with 4.60% being the top high-yield savings rate with ""no strings attached."" Savings and money market account rates can drop at any time, however. To ensure you earn today's rates for months or even years into the future,consider a CD instead. The top rate there is also 4.60%, for terms of 6 to 10 months. Or you can lock in a slightly lower APY that will be guaranteed for longer. Rates on brokerage money market funds and cash management accounts showed little change this week, while rates on Treasurys held mostly steady in the shorter durations but declined somewhat among longer bonds. The rates below are the top nationally available APYs from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed, but can change at any time. Treasury securities pay their rate through maturity and can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect, or can be bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage. I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirect and can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account—sometimes called ahigh-yield savings account—that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you18 options paying 4.35% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type—money market or savings—pays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.40% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includesoptions paying up to 4.60% APY. Note that the ""top rates"" quoted for savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research of hundreds of banks and credit unions. These are very different from the national averages, comprising all institutions offering accounts of those types—including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, national averages are always low, while the top rates we present are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.96% to 4.22% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds ""swept"" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- to 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.74% to 4.75%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsdirectly fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect—the U.S. Treasury’s online platform for buying federal government securities—has no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. Every six months you own the bond, your rate will change. I bond rates will go up on May 1. While we don't know the exact rate Treasury will announce that day fornewbonds, we know that for existing I bond holders, your next six-month rate will increase by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe upcoming rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

"2025-04-26 09:00:00";"This Event Could Be the Next Catalyst for Intel's Stock";"Shares of Intel (INTC) finished the week on a down note after its latest financial outlook disappointed investors. The stock’s next catalyst might be just a few days away. Lip-Bu Tan, who presided over thechip company’s quarterly resultsThursday for the first time as CEO, will on Tuesday give the keynote address at an event associated with Intel’s Foundry business, which makes chips for other companies.Bank of America analysts in a Friday note said the event could be paired with the announcement of partnerships with other big tech firms. Intel has sought to grow the Foundry business; early last year, itspoke of ambitionsto be the world’s second-largest foundry behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) by 2030. Its 2024 foundry revenue, however, fell from a year earlier—it came in north of $17 billion, roughly 30% of the company’s total—and its operating loss widened. This year reports have suggested that Intel might look to sell a stake in the Foundry operation to TSMC; that company, however,has denied talks. Investors were tracking the possibility that a spinoff or sale of Foundry might be in the works wellbefore Tan took over. Investors continue to look for signs of dealmaking. Optimism about a range of possibilities, ranging all the way up to a sale of the entire company, has moved the shares in recent months. That could still be the case.

Bank of America analysts, who have a neutral rating for Intel's stock and a $23 price target that is a few cents above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, said Intel is “too big to turn around quickly, but optionality [is] still there.” The stock has lost over a third of its value in the past year through Friday's close.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/this-event-could-be-the-next-catalyst-for-intel-stock-11722067"
"2025-04-26 18:42:04";"Big Tech carries Wall Street to the close of its winning, roller-coaster week";"Big Tech stocks carried Wall Street Friday to the close of a winning, roller-coaster week, one that saw markets swing from fear to relief and back to caution because of President Donald Trump’s trade war. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to add some more to a big three-day rally, and it’s back within 10.1% of its record set earlier this year. Spurts for Nvidia and other influential tech stocks sent the Nasdaq composite up a market-leading 1.3%. But they masked a mixed day of trading on Wall Street, where more stocks fell within the S&P 500 than rose, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added only a modest 20 points, or 0.1%. Alphabet climbed 1.7% in its first trading after Google’s parent company reported late Thursday that its profit soared 50% in the beginning of 2025 from a year earlier, more than analysts expected. Alphabet is one of the biggest companies on Wall Street in terms of size, and that gives its stock’s movements extra influence on the S&P 500 and other indexes. Another market heavyweight, Nvidia, was also a major force pushing the S&P 500 index upward after the chip company rose 4.3%. They helped offset a 6.7% drop for Intel, which fell even though its results for the beginning of the year also topped expectations. The chip company said it’s seeing “elevated uncertainty across the industry” and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It wasn’t just Intel. Roughly three out of every five stocks in the S&P 500 sank, including Eastman Chemical, which dropped 6.2% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Mark Costa said that the “macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased” and that future demand for its products “is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs.”    Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to “macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies” even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 5.3%. Companies across industries have increasingly been saying the uncertainty created by Trump’s tariffs is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year. Stocks bounced back from a steep slide on Monday on hopes that Trump may be softening his approach on trade and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which had earlier shaken markets. The hope is that if Trump rolls back some of his stiff tariffs, he could avert a recession that many investors see as otherwise likely because of his trade war. But Trump’s on-again-off-again tariffs may nevertheless be pushing households and businesses to alter their spending and freeze plans for long-term investment because of how quickly conditions can change, sometimes seemingly by the hour. “Business owners scrambling to figure out their supply chains and exposure to tariffs is more than just a distraction,” according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “It could be an existential threat, especially for smaller businesses that don’t have the scale or resources to have the same supply chain flexibility as larger firms.” All told, the S&P 500 rose 40.44 points to 5,525.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 20.10 to 40,113.50, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 216.90 to 17,382.94. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly across much of Europe following more mixed movements in Asia. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9%, but stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.1%. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased some more, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.25% from 4.32% late Thursday. It’s been generally falling since approaching 4.50% earlier this month in a surprising rise that suggested investors worldwide may have been losing faith in the U.S. bond market’s reputation as a safe place to park cash. Yields have dropped as several reports on the U.S. economy have come in weaker than expected, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates later this year to support growth. A report on Friday morning said sentiment among U.S. consumers sank in April, though not by as much as economists expected. The survey from the University of Michigan said its measure of expectations for coming conditions has dropped 32% since January for the steepest three-month percentage decline seen since the 1990 recession. The value of the U.S. dollar meanwhile held steady against the euro and other rival currencies. It’s been recovering some of its sharp, unexpected losses from earlier this month that had rattled investors.

"2025-04-27 11:00:00";"A Possible Recession Clue And Earnings Bonanza Upcoming";"In addition to the busiest week of earnings season, the economic calendar is packed with impactful ... More data, like first-quarter US GDP and the monthly jobs report. It is possible that US GDP contracted in the first quarter, but tariffs complicate the analysis.getty In the second busiest period of earnings releases, 119 S&P 500 companies reported earnings last week. 73% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With 184 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week, it is the busiest week of the reporting season. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with impactful data, like first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly jobs report.  S&P 500 Earnings SeasonGlenview Trust, FactSet, Bloomberg Earnings At A Glance The communications services sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL) was the most significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the communications services sector, which rose to 23.3% from 4.4%.   Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 10.1% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far.

The better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks soaring by 4.6% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 10% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed by a wide margin last week. The group exited bear market territory but is 19.8% below the mid-December all-time high. Market ReturnsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield After the concern a few weeks ago about the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness, yields have been drifting lower since April 11. At the time, several less frightening factors seemed to be more likely causes of the increase in yields than some mass exodus from U.S. dollar-based assets, and yields even moved lower last week despite the robust rally in risk assets.   The 10-year Treasury yield has been down 0.25% since April 11, with most of the decline in yields due to a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. This usually happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks.10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield DecompositionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Dollar Strength The U.S. dollar has rebounded from its April 21 low, despite concerns among some that it might be falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. A look at the dollar's longer-term history shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999, so it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration might welcome some depreciation of the dollar to boost exports.US DollarGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported last week, and they provided a mixed bag. Tesla earnings were below expectations, but the stock rallied on the news that Elon Musk would soon be curtailing his government activities and returning to company management. Alphabet’s results were impressive, showing strong growth in cloud services and better monetization of its artificial intelligence offerings. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday.Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings GrowthGlenview Trust, FactSet, Bloomberg Beyond the Magnificent 7, the busiest week of the reporting season, has many notable companies scheduled, including Pfizer (PFE), Mastercard (MA), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), and Berkshire Hathway (BRK/A, BRK/B). Earnings Insights By Sector According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Comcast (CMCSA) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the communication services sector. Healthcare, industrials, and technology sectors also saw better earnings growth rates last week. The healthcare sector benefited from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which both swung from losses in the same quarter last year to better-than-expected profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices.Estimated Earnings Growth By SectorGlenview Trust, FactSet Revenue Results By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth.Estimated Sales Growth By SectorGlenview Trust, FactSet What To Watch This Week Markets will remain very attuned to news flow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of economic growth headwind. In addition to a packed earnings calendar, some top-tier economic releases this week could impact markets. Though it is backward-looking, the first quarter GDP report should provide some clues as to how much momentum the U.S. had at the start of the year. Care will need to be taken when looking at the GDP data, since there are some unique factors due to the tariff announcements. Because the data is messy and its current forecast calls for a 2.5% contraction in first-quarter GDP, the Atlanta Fed even produced an alternative forecast that adjusts for the import and export of gold, which is at a more reasonable -0.4%. Consensus estimates from economists are currently at +0.4%.1Q 2025 US Economic Growth EstimatesGlenview Trust, Bloomberg A negative first-quarter GDP print could prompt many people to argue that the economy is already in recession. While the simple definition of recession has been two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the National Bureau of Economic Research has historically been the final arbiter of dating the business cycle. The NBER uses many factors and typically takes a significant period before an official verdict, so it isn’t invaluable in the moment. Given that the threat of tariffs likely caused a substantial increase in imports to front-run the additional costs, which would decrease headline GDP, final sales to private domestic purchases will be a better measure to watch. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. For example, in 2022, the initial estimate of second-quarter GDP contracted, completing the second decline in a row. While the second quarter GDP was eventually revised away, the continued growth of final sales to private domestic purchases at the time would lead a sensible person to conclude that it remained a soft patch but not yet a recession. The disruptions aren’t the same in 2025, but the 2022 economic data was also subject to significant noise after the pandemic.Measures Of US Economic ActivityGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The monthly jobs report is likely even more critical than GDP since jobs are crucial to allowing U.S. consumers to continue spending to support economic growth. The job market has been softening this year, but is still adding jobs, which is not a recessionary characteristic. Consensus estimates point to modest non-farm payroll growth of 130,000 in April and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%.US Unemployment RateGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Investors must work hard to cut through the tariff noise in the economic and earnings releases this week. While a recession signal is unlikely, there should be some signs of an economy continuing to lose some steam.

All of the 20 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have issued “buy” or equivalent ratings for the stock, which has lost 7% so far in 2025. Their consensus price target slightly above $492 would suggest over 25% upside from Friday’s closing price of $391.85. Wedbush analysts recently lowered their price target to $475 from $550 amid worries aboutPresident Trump's tariffs, but said they ""remain long term bullish"" on Microsoft, pointing to its AI potential. ""It has become crystal clear to us that the monetization opportunities around deploying AI in the cloud is a transformational opportunity across the industry with Redmond remaining in the driver's seat,"" they said. Goldman Sachs analysts, who similarly maintained a ""buy"" rating for Microsoft but lowered their price target to $450 from $500, said the current economic environment has created a ""wide range of different outcomes,"" but that they believe Microsoft could be ""well positioned to capitalize"" on AI opportunities. Morningstar analystssaidMicrosoft could also be in a stronger position than many other tech companies, because it ""has minimal risk exposure to retail, advertising spending, cyclical hardware, or physical supply chains.""

China’s Huawei Technologies is preparing to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, hoping to replace some higher-end products of U.S. chip giant [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/), The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese company hopes that the latest iteration of its Ascend AI processors will be more powerful than Nvidia’s H100, and is slated to receive the first batch of samples of the processor as early as late May, the report added.

Reuters reported on Monday that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month.

Huawei and its Chinese peers have struggled for years to match Nvidia in building top-end chips that could compete with the U.S. firm’s products for training models, a process where data is fed to algorithms to help them learn to make accurate decisions.

Seeking to limit China’s technological development, particularly advances for its military, Washington has cut China off from Nvidia’s most advanced AI products, including its flagship B200 chip.

The H100 chip, for example, was banned from sale in China in 2022 by U.S. authorities before it was even launched.

"2025-04-27 15:52:41";"Big Tech’s Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High";">The last time Big Tech delivered earnings, Donald Trump had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors’ main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits.

>Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture.

>This week’s quarterly results from Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that’s wiped $5.5 trillion from the S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap.

>Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn’t giving the companies’ estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven — which also includes Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions.

>That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks’ share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster fears of muted corporate spending ahead.

>“Any modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,” said Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year’s weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity.

>Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its worst quarter in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive Elon Musk intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet beat expectations but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 index jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it’s still down 15% in 2025.

>A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams.

>Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders — Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta — are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft’s sudden decision to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures.

>Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.

>That said, there’s little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty. American Airlines Group Inc. and Skechers USA Inc. are among companies that have abandoned forecasts this quarter.

>Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters.

>“I think the more experienced management aren’t even going to try,” he said.

>A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants’ dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies — even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

>That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trump said a deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs he’s posted on Chinese goods.

Wall Street will be paying close attention to the tech giant’s guidance for the current quarter in an effort to determine whatimpact tariffs and potential price increaseshave had on consumer demand for the company’s devices. Investors will also be looking for updates on recent reports that Apple intends to produce most of its U.S.-sold iPhones in India by the end of 2026. The company is aiming to mitigate risks related to the Trump administration’s steep import duties imposed on China, a country where Apple reportedly assembles up to 90% of its iPhones. Apple shares trade 16% lower year to date as of Friday’s close but have recovered nearly 25% from this month’s low as investors assess the company’s plans to navigate tariff-related challenges. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Apple’sweekly chartand identify key price levels worth watching ahead of the tech giant’s earnings report. After staging a dramatic intradayreversalat the 200-week moving average (MA) on above-averagevolumeearlier this month, Apple shares have continued to gain ground. However, while therelative strength index (RSI)has moved upwards ahead, the indicator remains just below the 50 threshold, signaling lackluster price momentum. Let’s point out keysupport and resistancelevels on Apple's chart that investors will likely be monitoring. The first area to monitor sits around $169. Retracements to this level on the chart would likely attract strong buying interest near this month’s low, which also closely aligns with the August 2022peak and troughsin October 2023 and April 2024. Thebulls’ failure to defend this key technical level opens the door for a drop to lower support at $157. Investors could seekentry pointsin this region near ahorizontal linethat connects several peaks and troughs on the chart between September 2021 and March 2023. In the event of a rally, it’s worth keeping an eye on the $220 level, an area currently just below the 50-week MA. The shares could run into selling pressure in this location nearprice actionon the chart extending back to June last year. Finally, further buying could see Apple's stock revisit the $237 area. Investors who haveaccumulated sharesat lower prices may seekprofit-takingopportunities in this region near last year’s July and October peaks.

"2025-04-28 15:09:39";"How To Start a Successful Dropshipping Business: A Comprehensive Guide";"If you're looking for a way to earn some extra cash while working from home, dropshipping could be an option for you, though it's not without it challenges. Dropshipping involves partnering with a third-party supplier to ship products and goods directly to customers. Unlike a traditional retailer, you don't have to worry about manufacturing products, keeping inventory in stock, or leasing out a retail space. While influencers on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, tout dropshipping as a way to get rich quick, building a successful dropshipping business—like developing any othere-commercesite–can take time, effort, and a willingness to expand your knowledge. Dropshippers essentially make money by being middlemen. A dropshipper will buy an item from a vendor at a certain price point and then turn around and sell it for more to a customer, while pocketing the difference. Here’s an example: A customer purchases an item from a dropshipper’s store for $25. The dropshipper then purchases that item from a third-party vendor for $10. The vendor then ships the product directly to the customer, and the dropshipper profits $15 from that transaction, excluding other expenses like shipping costs. Some e-commerce platforms even allow dropshippers to link their store directly to the third-party vendors. This means that any new purchases are automatically sent to the vendor, streamlining the process. One of the most important steps in creating a successful dropshipping business is choosing the right products. In order to turn a profit, you’ll want to choose products that will be appealing to potential customers. You may consider doingmarket research, which involves gathering information on possible customers, determining if there’s a need or want for the products you want to offer, and identifying competitors. By analyzing competitors, you can get an idea of what prices you should charge or if the market for a particular product is oversaturated, meaning there’s less consumer demand for that product. Lastly, you’ll want to determine what third-party vendors you’ll rely on forinventory. If you plan to use a supplier located abroad, look into the cost of any potentialduties,tariffs, or fees that may be charged for shipping goods to the U.S.. You'll want to factor those costs into the price you’ll ultimately charge for the products you sell. To open an online store, you’ll first need to find an e-commerce platform that suits your needs. You’ll want to ask yourself a few questions when evaluating different platforms: After you’ve determined which platform is right for you, the work has just begun. You’ll need to create a digital storefront and make listings for all the products you plan to offer. Whenever you create your listings, make sure to include multiple high-quality images of the product and a specific, yet concise description of the product. After you open a digital storefront, you'll want to focus on marketing your business online.Social mediaplatforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X are free to join, but if you want to advertise on these platforms, you'll typically need to pay extra. Additionally, you may want to rely on your network to help boost your business's profile. For example, if you know anyone with lots of followers, you may consider asking them to post about your store and provide them with affiliate links so they get a kickback. Another important marketing tool you may want to use issearch engine optimization (SEO). When you're designing your store, make sure to include certain keywords or phrases that potential customers search for when looking for businesses or stores that sell products like yours. Building a successful dropshipping business can be challenging because the market can be competitive, and it may be hard to stand out from businesses selling similar items. While dropshipping involves purchasing cheap products from abroad, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on certain foreign goods imported to the U.S. will likely make it harder to launch a new business, as those tariffs will drive up the cost of goods. Theelimination of an important trade loopholecould raise costs dramatically, too. The Trump administration has announced that it will eliminate the ""de minimis exemption"" on packages from China and Hong Kong. This exemption, which allowed foreign companies to ship small-value packages (worth less than $800) to the U.S. without paying duties or fees, will expire on May 2. On May 2, the per postal item fee for packages shipped directly from China will be $100, rising to $200 on June 1.Dropshippers may find that potential customers have little appetite for their goods when products aren't so cheap anymore. Dropshipping can be a flexible way to earn money from home, but it requires careful planning. While it may be promoted as a way to get rich quickly, building a sustainable business takes time and effort. Yet dropshipping businesses may soon face headwinds due to increasing tariffs and changes to trade rules, which could shrink profit margins and reduce consumer demand.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-start-dropshipping-business-11719913"

This video was recorded on April 23, 2025 Mary Long:The robots are coming, but maybe not very quickly. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Mary Long, joined on this fine Wednesday morning by Sanmeet Deo. Sanmeet, great to see you. How are you doing? Sanmeet Deo:Hey, nice to see you. Mary Long:We've got one story that's going to be our single story today because there's a lot to talk about in this report, none other than Tesla. Dropped earnings yesterday after the bell. Lots of anticipation with this one. Obviously, it's a large company. It's a company led by a controversial leader. Let's put it at that. Coming into this report, we had Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. He's a longtime Tesla Bull, and he told NBC that this report is a ''Moment of truth for Tesla.'' We're going to dive into the details of this report in a second. As I said, it's our single, our sole story today. But let's start with the big picture idea here. You own Tesla? What truth was revealed in this report? Sanmeet Deo:I think the truth is that the automotive segment is hitting the brakes. The one number that can symbolize everything that's happening for their segment this quarter was the 2.1% operating margin, which was significantly lower than last year's 5.5%. The whole story is really captured in that margin number. It's lower average selling prices for vehicles, lower delivery volumes, volume time price, lower revenues, and higher R&D expenses. That margin has significantly is lower than what they've had in really over the past few quarters, so very concerning in that sense. Now, energy and storage, and services came in very strong. That was great, but they're much smaller part of their revenue. The question is have they taken the eye off the ball? Is competition hitting them harder than the market suspects? The one other truth I'll say is that the market liked Musk's comment, which I think we're going to talk about, about reducing his time with DOGE and getting back to focusing on Tesla. Mary Long:Let's hone in on that piece, because in spite of that comment seems to be what is causing this rise in Tesla stock that we're seeing this morning. We also saw a rise after hours yesterday, pre-market this morning, and that's only continued throughout today. But again, you just walked through the earnings. There were some glimmers there in other segments, but this automotive segment, as you said, largely was hitting the brakes. It seems that the surge is largely attributable to Musk's comment that he'll be taking time away from DOGE and returning to Tesla as soon as May. I've got a question on this, but is that what you two attribute this jump to, or do you think, maybe, there's something else going on? Sanmeet Deo:No, absolutely. This quarter, if you look at it, with automotive segments being probably 80, 85% of their revenues, this is a bad quarter for them. Their vehicle deliveries were disappointment. That we already knew. That was already reported. Profitability came in a lot lower than expected. I would anticipated on a report like this, the stock would be down. But given that Musk made a statement that he's going to focus back on Tesla, that's something that has been an overhang on the stock. Also, the market is very big today off of relief rally. That, too, is helping their stock bounce. Mary Long:This time allocation comment is an interesting one to me because I can see, obviously, why Musk returning to Tesla could be a boost for the company. But I also wonder how much of Tesla's miss here, in this quarter, is attributable to the time that he's not spending at Tesla versus how much of it is attributable to the political associations that he's tied himself to. How do you think about that? How much of this miss, especially in the automotive segment, do you say, hey, this is a problem that's due to Musk not actually being at the helm, and that will be solved by his return to the helm or actually, this is a problem that's attributable to the political associations that Musk has made for himself. Sanmeet Deo:I think a decent amount could be alleviated with Musk spending more time at Tesla. He's known to have a tight reign and high attention to detail when he's focused on the company. I've heard reports from people that work at Tesla that he's very detail-oriented. He's very in the weeds when it comes to the company, but that's if his attention is there. His attention has not been there, so that's that eye off the ball part where he's not allocating the time needed to really guide that ship. Some of it, too, is increasing competition, cheaper cars from China, causing some effects there. I think there's been a lot of talk about brand degradation. Tesla is a brand. It's successful a lot due to its brand. Musk political associations have rubbed people the wrong way. People may not like his associations, how much time he's spending. It has taken a hit to the brand. That's pretty noticeable in the numbers as well. Mary Long:We talked about this morning about how Wall Street is buying up Tesla. They like this comment from Musk. But if you look at insider activity at the company, it seems that over the past 12 months, Tesla insiders have been doing the opposite. Over the past 12 months, Tesla insiders have sold 28 times and bought zero times. You like to pay attention to insider activity here at The Fool. What do you make of this? Is this a red flag, yellow flag, or something that you can put an asterisk by and justify somehow? Sanmeet Deo:I think there's no flag on the play, honestly. All these sales were part of a planned or pre-arranged stock option exercise strategy. I like to look at open market buys and open market sales when it comes to insider buying or transactions, and none of the ones I saw were really open market sales. Although there was one open market sale in the past six months from Elon's brother, Kimbal Musk, for 75,000 shares totaling $25.6 million. Maybe he's buying a new house? I don't know. That in itself could possibly be a yellow flag, but all the others I'm not too concerned about. Mary Long:If he's buying a new house with $25.5 million, I want to see that house. [laughs] Sanmeet Deo:Absolutely. Mary Long:Tesla's all-time high was last hit on December 17th when it closed at nearly $480. Today, it's closer to 250, again, it's moving up, so that might change by the end of the day, but that's where it is right around the time we're recording. Breakfast News, which is our daily newsletter here at The Fool. It gives a rundown of daily market happenings. They asked readers this morning in the newsletter when they think Tesla will return to its all-time high, if ever. I'll pose that question to you before we dive into more of the details of this report. When do you think Tesla will hit its all-time high again, if ever? How do you think it gets there? Sanmeet Deo:I think it's going to hit the all-time on April 23rd, 2030. Now, I'm kidding. [laughs] I think it could be at least five plus years or so, something like that. Usually, when we see these huge massive market corrections, what I've noticed is whether it be the market or certain stocks, they hit highs, they correct heavily, and then it takes a long time to hit that all-time high again at some point. That's assuming the businesses continue to succeed and do well. In order for them to get there, the automotive segment needs to gain its growth momentum, and we're going to talk a little bit about that later, too, about how they could do that. Some positive traction on the fully autonomous driving humanoids, which we'll talk about, too. That could really boost the enthusiasm for the future prospects of the company and the business, and the stock. If they can start making more traction rather than empty promises, then it could hit all-time high again. Mary Long:The large weak spot in this report was the automotive segment. We were told during the earnings call that, ''Given economic uncertainty, resulting from changing trade policy, more affordable options are as critical as ever.'' The idea of a more affordable Tesla has been teased for a while now, though plans have remained ambiguous, elusive. Growing this segment back and gaining traction here again, a clear path to that seems to be, if you can make this affordable option a reality, that would be a great way to, again, revive this automotive segment. How do you see that playing in? Again, I've mentioned that these plans for an affordable Tesla remain ambiguous. What would you like to see that plan and practice for a more affordable Tesla actually look like? Sanmeet Deo:I think that affordability is absolutely critical to Tesla's automotive thesis related to their electric vehicles because they're getting heavy competition from Chinese makers. Like I said before, they're producing very cheap cars. Now, whether those cars are just as cheap here in the United States versus those in their home countries is something to wonder. When I think of affordability, when it comes to cars, I think the Gold Standard Hondas and Toyotas. Those are the most affordable that are out there. You see them all over, and they're for the masses. If Tesla can create a car for the masses, I think they need to get it to around $20,000 price point because you have Hondas and Toyotas at their lower base models at around $23,000, $25,000. I think that if they can get to that price point, make it profitable, it could be huge for the automotive segment. Then you'll start seeing Teslas literally everywhere, not just for the high-end. I think, though, they need to create a clear product roadmap and what is going to look like for them to get there, because Musk has the tendency to overpromise and underdeliver, and they need to flip that script and really make it plausible that they can achieve this mass market. Mary Long:If Tesla can develop this more affordable option, that's one way to revive its automotive segment. But if we see vehicle deliveries truly begin to flatten out, as seems to be happening in this report, what does that mean for the Tesla growth story? Sanmeet Deo:It's going to be challenging because, again, automotives vehicles are about 80 something percent of their revenues. If that just starts to flatten, that's a majority of their business that's flattening. While energy and storage and services, and all these other great pie-in-the-sky autonomous and humanoids are great. They're not a huge core part of their business. This is vehicles are a core part of their business. If they can't make it work, their business will struggle. Now, that's not to say that autonomous and humanoids can come out of nowhere at some point down the road and make up for all those losses. That could happen, but that's still a very aggressive and far-out into the horizon prospect. Mary Long:Then let's focus on where those other business segments are today. The energy generation and storage segment of Tesla has seen nice steady growth over the past several quarters. This is an area of the business that actually saw notable revenue gains this quarter. Where is that growth coming from? Sanmeet Deo:They're getting a significant increase in demand for both residential power walls, grid scale, the megapac battery solutions because of things like renewable energy adoption, growing need for grid stabilization, resilience, rising energy costs. They're in a sweet spot of the market where their demand for their products are high. Mary Long:We had this whole conversation at the top about what it means that Musk is away from Tesla, what it might mean if he returns. What's interesting to me is that we're seeing this growth in the energy segment while Musk is away, running DOGE. Is that a bright spot? Does that mean that, hey, the energy side of the business can actually effectively run itself? Sanmeet Deo:I think the overall operations, the day-to-day, can probably do a decent job, like we've seen, because of how they've performed on a day-to-day basis without Musk, but the overall vision, strategic direction of the company. I've always thought of Musk and Tesla, you can't get into the mind of Musk, really. But he has some grand vision of how things are going to all piece together when it comes to autonomous and cars and energy, humanoids, all this stuff is going to it's probably altogether in his mind. He's probably having a hard time delivering the message to all of us. That whole vision is needed, and I think him providing that and focusing on that is going to help guide things. Day to day, they can probably do well, but whether they can scale to another level without him, I don't know if that can happen. Mary Long:A piece of that vision that's long been teased is this idea of the robotaxi and the Cybercab. Musk said on the call that ''We remain on track for the pilot launch of robotaxi in Austin by June.'' June is right around the corner, so that feels very soon. It will be interesting to see if that is indeed something that the company can deliver on. But notably, Musk also says, the purpose-built robotaxi product Cybercab, is scheduled for volume production starting 2026. We throw these terms around a lot, robotaxi, Cybercab. What actually is the difference between the two products, and how do they work together? Sanmeet Deo:I'm glad you're asking, because that's critical, and I always confused myself before I actually looked into it. The robotaxis, basically, they're going to utilize existing Tesla models, primarily the Model Y, to run the fully self-driving mode. Cybercabs are going to be specifically built cars for the robotaxi service. Its whole purpose is to be used as an autonomous taxi service. The robotaxi service it's a pilot program in Austin. They're going to collect data. They're going to get that experience out there, see how it operates. Then the dedicated cyber calves will come out, start being produced around 2026, which then they'll roll out at some point. On a side note, I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago, and I saw Wemos all over the place, and they're pretty wild. It's very futuristic. That's all I can really say about them. Mary Long:I'm sure. We'll close out by touching on what I think is your favorite piece of this company, which is the humanoids. Again, this is something that we're still seeing ramp up in production, still in development largely. Musk said, though, on the earnings call that he expects to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of the year, and that he expects to scale Optimus faster than any product he thinks in history, to get millions of units per year as soon as possible. He later clarified that timeline and said that perhaps the company could reach a million bots per year in less than five years, maybe four. Why is Optimus allegedly so easy to scale/do you buy this timeline fully, or is this another example of Musk overpromising and potentially underdelivering? Sanmeet Deo:[laughs] I love humanoids. I'm a humanoid fan. But I think it's potentially easy to scale because of Tesla's expertise in manufacturing, AI, vertical integration from developing all these, at least the EVs and the software that they build. They can scale it. Whether this timeline is believable, I'm not buying it, because I think that, again, Musk has a tendency to overpromise and underdeliver. Could it happen in 10-20 years? Possibly. Is it going to happen in the next couple of years? Not so sure about Optimus. Mary Long:Whenever this does happen, Musk has called out that he thinks that the humanoid robots can bring in $10 trillion in revenue for Tesla. What does your analysis say? Regardless of when these robots are actually delivered at the scale that Musk is talking about, do you see the same possibilities in terms of revenue that he does? Sanmeet Deo:Ten trillion does sound like a wild number, probably very unachievable. But if you take a step back and think about it, there's about 128 million households in the United States. Maybe you assume each one purchases at least one. They've been rumored to be about 30,000 once they've brought the cost down to a reasonable amount. That right there is about three trillion in revenues for households, commercial side of humanoid production, could it hit seven trillion? Possibly, you have them in factories, even in businesses, even in restaurants, you have in different places. Then you have to factor in maybe parts or pairs servicing all the revenues that you get from that, as well, because it's not just going to be sales of these humanoids. It's going to be all the other ancillary stuff, too. Ten trillion wild sounds wild. Maybe not that wild. Mary Long:Over the weekend, humanoid robots raced against actual people in a half-marathon in Beijing. The point of this isn't for humanoids to outrun humans. I saw this all over the news, and I was like, wait, really, what is the point here? It seems to me maybe more like a publicity stunt or just a test case to see, hey, how capable are these robots actually doing human actions? Well, close out on a fun question. Optimus was not in this race, but had it been, how do you think it would have stacked up? Sanmeet Deo:I think it would have been terrible. If you've ever seen them walk, they walk really slow and really measured, and I don't even know if they can run, honestly. That was funny. The first thing I thought of when I saw that race was, why are humans trying to create something better than us? Why do we do that? Mary Long:Well, and it misses the point of why people run marathons or half marathons in the first place. We all know that we can't hit the fastest time in the world, but we're about striving to be better and for self-improvement. Sanmeet Deo:Exactly. I wouldn't be as impressed if a human breaks the fastest speed record versus a human doing it. Mary Long:For sure. Sanmeet Deo, always a pleasure.

Up next, Asit Sharma joins me for a look at Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, the company that's trying to give NVIDIA a run for its money. Asit, despite the fact that semiconductor stocks are largely cyclical, it feels like they've been in the news all the time over the past few years. One of the names that's often in the news nearly every day is NVIDIA, but a competitor that gets a little bit less time in the spotlight is AMD. The news, the media love NVIDIA, you love AMD. Maybe, help us set the table here. These are both chip stocks, but how are they different? What is AMD doing that's different than what NVIDIA is doing? Asit Sharma:Mary, yes, to full disclosure. I do own both companies. I own AMD, I own NVIDIA. I have both recommended NVIDIA and AMD, and services I personally run, and services that I work on. I like both companies. AMD is a little bit different because it's more of a diversified player in the semiconductor ecosystem. Although I'm sure there's someone out there who's listening right now and saying, wait, NVIDIA is becoming incredibly diversified. It's branching into so many areas. But the traditional way we look at how semiconductor companies operate I think you give AMD the edge in diversification. It plays in the chip market, so it makes chips for servers. It makes embedded chips that go into industrial Internet of Things devices. It makes chips for gaming, GPUs for gaming, like NVIDIA does. It also makes GPU accelerators, which is where all the attention is focused. I didn't know you were saying. It seems like if these are such cyclical companies, why are they always in the news cycle? But I think we're going to be talking about such companies for quite a while. Mary Long:Help me understand this. AMD's biggest customers includeMicrosoft, Meta, Alphabet, Sony, Oracle, big names. We know a bunch of them. The list also continues beyond those big names. NVIDIA does not publicly disclose its customer list, but it is widely believed that its biggest customers are get ready, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet,Amazon. There's a lot of overlap between those customer lists. You mentioned that AMD is more diversified. But if I'm the person who works at one of these tech companies and I'm in charge of buying up AI chips, what's getting me to buy AMD chips rather than solely purchasing from NVIDIA? Asit Sharma:Mary, first, we're going to make a distinction here because you said AI chips, and that signals to me that you want to talk about GPU accelerators, the kinds of chips that are used for artificial intelligence, specifically generative AI that help us use large language models and are being applied to so many different industries. If you are, let's say, a hyperscaler, like an Amazon Web Services, or a Microsoft as your or an Oracle, why would you want to buy these chips? Number 1, it decreases your sole reliance on NVIDIA, which has been leading the charge and really developing the strongest, most powerful chips for the last three years since GenAi exploded onto the scene. But also, there's a growing argument within these companies that we want to be able to offer the ability to use generative AI at a lower cost to our customers and for our own bottom lines. Hence, Oracle just placed an order for about 30,000 MI 355x. I think that's the name of the accelerator, a series from AMD, which is an order worth billions of dollars. This was disclosed just a few weeks ago in Oracle's earnings conference call. Because one of the reasons is that total cost of ownership over time for Oracle is going to be less versus buying similar GPUs from NVIDIA. There's some case where you want to buy NVIDIA's GPUs to offer that power and performance. But there's lots of places in the generative AI world for inference, the outputs of these models and for some training purposes, too, where AMD's chips are just as good for lower cost. You name NVIDIA as being the player with the strongest, fastest chips. The general consensus is that, OK, AMD creates chips that can compete pretty well with NVIDIA, but they still have to catch up with NVIDIA from a technological standpoint. As retail investors, how can we understand the intricacies of the differences between these technologies? What does that path of catching up to NVIDIA from a technological standpoint actually look like for AMD from the outside? I think in some ways, it's becoming a little bit easier to understand than it used to be. There's one very visible thing that I think so many listeners may have heard of. One of the things that makes NVIDIA's products great not only is the GPU hardware, but it's the software libraries, collectively known as CUDA, that you get when you buy NVIDIA GPUs. Some of these come with the purchase for these big hyperscalers and even, academic institutions. Some of those have higher costs associated with them, but they make those GPUs really powerful, and that's been an edge that NVIDIA has had for a long time. Now, that's a closed system. It's NVIDIA'S own. AMD has chosen to go another route with ROCM. This is their open-source version of accelerator libraries, which they basically invite the world to come and help improve that. That's getting better and better. One of the things that we need to see out of AMD is not just being able to be within spitting distance on the GPU side, but to have its software libraries become more powerful. To bring down that total cost of ownership, but also just to make their GPUs function at a level that NVIDIA's do. Now, there's another big picture thing for folks to watch in the coming years. NVIDIA is so ahead of the race because it's now moved on from supplying these great GPUs to supplying rack-scale systems. You and I were talking about Vera Rubin a couple of weeks ago. All these crazy names that NVIDIA has that are poetic. What this simply means is that instead of buying GPUs and making them operate, companies that are hyperscale companies or think even enterprise businesses now can connect those GPUs on racks and have those GPUs communicate with each other and become this integrated unit of computation that's much more powerful than just buying them piecemeal and throwing them up on a server rack. Rack Scale means interconnecting a lot of these GPUs. NVIDIA has the connection technology, which is ENV Link, and I have talked about. They also have these great GPUs. We're going to Asterisk this bit because I know you're going to ask me about an acquisition that AMD made that answer is part of this question, but AMD needs to develop Rack Scale systems to really compete with NVIDIA. These are the two things. Get better in software and migrate to Rack Scale systems. I think between those two things, it can really have a competitive offering. I think we've moved beyond the day where we're always looking at the specs. Like, how fast is this GPU? What's the performance of it? What's the workload? How's it performed vis-à-vis benchmarks? AMD is getting closer and closer on the benchmarks. Now it becomes a question of software and making those GPs talk together. Mary Long:If you're an outside investor, one of the ways that you might measure AMD's progress in those two areas is not just listening to what the company actually says, but also keeping tabs on their R&D numbers. Between 2021 and 2022, AMD nearly doubled its R&D spend. It's continued to tick up in the years since, but at a slower pace than that interval. We haven't yet seen that payoff in AMD's margins. Operating margin was north of 22% in 2021. It's under 8% in 2024. For comparison, NVIDIA's operating margin was nearly 62.5% for fiscal 2025. You're seeing foundation being laid by AMD to try to catch up with NVIDIA. When and how will investors be able to tell whether those R&D investments are actually paying off for the company? Asit Sharma:One of the things I want to point out before I answer that question, Mary, is that NVIDIA's operating margin of 62.5% is an unfair comparison, not just to AMD, but to any major company. This is probably the first or second-highest operating margin in the S&P 500. If you think about the biggest and baddest US companies, this is NVIDIA riding a wave of demand in which it's exercising a lot of pricing power. Historically, NVIDIA's operating margin is healthy because it's more of a GPU-dominant business. It can range between 15 and 30% in good times. But it's a company that also has negative operating margins at the bottom of the cycle, we've seen that too, out of NVIDIA. Right now, it's taking that advantage and exercising the fact that its products are so in demand. As an NVIDIA investor, I watch that as one of the things that's going to come back down to earth, what should be an operating margin for AMD in a good part of the cycle? To me, it should be somewhere around 20% above. You mentioned it was hitting that in 2021. Again, it's a more diversified business. It has different paths to win. I think we're seeing that R&D investment paying off this year in 2025. We should see operating margin move up to around 10% this year. The cadence looks like it's going to hit somewhere between 12 and 14% in 2026 and should hit around 20% in 2027. Only now we're seeing the investment in that R&D payoff, but that was a lot of quick-turn investment where AMD pivoted to the accelerator space because they saw the opportunity. Recall something that Lisa Su did when she first took over at AMD in October of 2014, which is to say, guys, we're going to innovate. We're not going to worry too much about the outside world, and we're going to make great products. It took two or three years for those investments to pay off, but it became look a leader in the chip space. This year, it displaced Intel for CPU coverage in data centers. I think as these years play out, the next three years, we're going to see that operating margin climb all the way up to 20% by 2027. Mary Long:You teased out news about this recent acquisition that AMD has pursued and followed through on. If you're one way to play catch-up in this chip race is to build things in-house, another way to grow your company might be to acquire businesses that are doing work that you're already doing or that you haven't yet touched. AMD earlier in August of last year, announced that they would be pursuing an acquisition of ZT Systems. They're a service maker. AMD shelled out nearly $5 billion for that company, paid about 75% of that price tag in cash. What does ZT Systems do, and how is that going to expand AMD's potential? Asit Sharma:ZT Systems is a designer of server systems, rack systems that I was just referring to in data centers. It not only designs them, but it manufactures them. AMD, yeah, shell out that $5 billion. Interestingly enough, Mary, it's going to actually sell off the manufacturing portion of ZT Systems because at its heart, AMD is a design company. They design chips. They don't really manufacture them. TSMC is one of its partner companies that actually manufactures chips. It's going to do the same thing here. That will help it also keep from maybe competing with some of its own suppliers. But I like this a lot because it lets AMD take a technology of its own, which is called Infinity Fabric, and basically replicate what NVIDIA is doing with its rack-scale systems. We should see in a system that's called the MI 4,000 sometime in 2026, AMD's first real convincing answer to NVIDIA's dominance. My thesis all along is that AMD doesn't have to displace NVIDIA, just needs a few billions off the top. NVIDIA is rolling with tens of billions of dollars of GPU revenue every quarter. Just give AMD a few billions of that, and this company is going to see a great boost to its margins in free cash flow. Free cash flow, I should mention, is going to more than double this year, even after AMD has announced a tariff hit from export controls on a lower-level chip it was designing for the Chinese market. It's still going to double its free cash flow this year, and it's on its way to a triple probably by 2028 in terms of free cash flow. Mary Long:Throughout this entire conversation, we've been making the comparison between NVIDIA and AMD and you just pulled out some numbers stating that, AMD's free cash flow is going to double, potentially triple relatively soon. If you look back from where we are now over the past year, whereas NVIDIA shares are up nearly 30% in that year-long time frame, shares of AMD have fallen over 40% in the same time period. What gives? It sounds like you're laying out a very compelling case for AMD and its growth path forward. Why does the current share price not seem to reflect that? Asit Sharma:I think the market's concerns are legitimate. The market is saying, look, if you are so great, AMD, then why didn't we see you explode in GPU sales in the first year after you said you were also going to play in this business? They did get off to a slow start out of the gate. There are questions about execution. Companies want to know if AMD really can provide that cost advantage. The other thing, I think, that poses a cloud over AMD is just this comparison. I've argued all along that AMD doesn't need this business to succeed as a company, but the market sees it very much as a race between the two most capable makers of GPUs, and NVIDIA is today been so far ahead that I think it suffers from that comparison. There's execution risk, and there's also this, I think, slightly unfair comparison that AMD suffers under, but that's actually a good place to be. AMD loved that position when it was just a shadow beneath Intel and took over that business. I'm not trying to forecast that it's going to take over NVIDIA's business. Again, I love both companies but I do think there's room in a company that now seems relatively cheap versus its future potential for it to grab some of that market share. I think the order that Oracle made that I mentioned at the beginning of this conversation is one of the first indications that the cost proposition is making sense to companies that don't want to keep spending indefinitely year after year at the pace that NVIDIA is rolling out as innovations. Remember, you and I were chatting about NVIDIA trying to have a new better product every 12 months. That's great until people's appetite and capital propensity starts to really push up against this. I liken it to people who have sort of free money and can keep buying the latest either car or stereo equipment, and then suddenly, when that money is tight, you start to really love what you've got. I like this vehicle. Sometimes those people turn into, and I have friends like this from trading out cars and leases to, I'm going to drive this car into the ground. I paid it off. I get that. AMD can really benefit from a world in which some of these hyperscalers are like, hey, I want to run some of these GPUs into the ground.

"2025-04-28 15:25:29";"Analyst Says Hyperscalers Won’t Stop Spending on NVIDIA (NVDA) Chips ‘No Matter What’";"We recently published a list ofTop 10 Stocks to Watch as Investors Brace for Recession. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks to watch as investors brace for recession. Despite some optimism in the market after President Donald Trump’s indication of possible talks with China, Wall Street analysts are warning about recession risks due to the impending impact of tariffs and an overall decline in consumer sentiment. Adam Parker, Trivariate Research CEO, said in a recent interview with CNBC that it’s “hard” to be bullish in this market because the impact of tariffs is yet to be reflected in companies’ earnings. Parker thinks that in the coming days, earnings reports of many companies will begin to show that we are indeed facing an economic slowdown: “You know there’s a difference between a growth scare and and then an actual growth slowdown I think in this case it is a growth slowdown I don’t know how much of it is yet and that’s where I think the challenge is but you can’t just say oh it’s an irrational growth scare that everyone has and it’s like an uncertain I think if you have a business with pricing power if you have a business that you know you can be okay. But there’s a lot of economically sensitive businesses we’re going to hear from next week and the week after if you think about how earning season typically unfolds where we may get guidance that isn’t quite as peachy as we’ve seen from you know the original guys in the banks and then some of the higher quality tech companies have reported.” READ ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article, we picked 10 stocks Wall Street is currently buzzing about. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder and CEO, explained in a latest program on CNBC why NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains his top AI pick. The analyst said that the demand for the company’s chips will remain strong. “Nvidia is still our top AI pick. And I know that that is probably at this point exhausting to hear. The stock has not worked this year. It really hasn’t worked the last 6 months. But I think if you look at the bottom line, 21 times forward earnings, I think those earnings are pretty solid. We’ve derisked the China issue now with the H20 ban. And I don’t think that the hyperscalers, no matter what happens in the economy, are going to stop spending on Nvidia chips. So that is still the name that our models are sticking with.” Answering a question about the potential impact of price declines of chips, the analyst said that the use cases for the AI technology will increase over time: “This happens always in tech, right? Prices come down and the ability of whether it’s software or hardware improves over time. That’s the story of technology. But I think the other side of the AI bull market is really what is the consumer side, what is the enterprise side for demand for these products. And what we’re seeing over the last 3 months — and I don’t think this is being reflected in stocks at all — is that there is huge demand for these products. And I think it’sre increasing and even accelerating with the 03 model launched last week from Open AI. You have Grok from xAI. You have Gemini’s new model from Google. All three of them have said they have capacity constraints in terms of what they can serve to customers right now. I think the demand will be there to force more chip buying even if prices do come down.” Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance due to several factors. In January 2025, investor concerns grew regarding the emergence of advanced AI models from China, reportedly developed at lower costs and with reduced computing requirements, raising doubts about Nvidia’s market dominance. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs targeting industries increased worries about higher operational costs. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia reported robust fiscal fourth-quarter results, highlighted by significant revenue growth driven by its data center segment. On the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the increasing computational requirements of future AI models, noting, “The more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer,” and adding that future reasoning models could demand substantially more compute resources. We believe Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure—including advancements in inference and reasoning during inference—continues to drive adoption among enterprises and startups, ensuring sustained demand for its high performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed and new clusters deployed, we see Nvidia as well-positioned to capitalize on rising computational needs across AI applications.” Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of top stocks to watch as investors brace for recession. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC. In an interview with Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bid, Gelsinger credited Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang with keeping the company ahead of rivals by pushing teams to stay at the cutting edge. He said Nvidia's advantage comes from a combination of strong execution and ""meaningful moats"" that protect its position in the fast-growing AI market. Nvidia's technologies like NVLink, which links GPUs within servers, and CUDA, a platform that speeds up computing workloads, were cited by Gelsinger as key examples of those moats. He noted that investment from large corporations and a surge of AI startups particularly in the Bay Area have accelerated demand for AI chips. ""I can't throw a rock right without hitting a new AI startup in the Bay Area,"" Gelsinger said. While Nvidia has gained momentum, Intel has struggled. Once a dominant force in Silicon Valley, Intel missed major industry shifts such as the rise of mobile and AI. The company's stock fell nearly 50% in 2024, prompting layoffs and buyouts during Gelsinger's tenure.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere. Shares of Nvidia are down a little over 2% after news the Chinese company Huawei is developing an AI chip it believes can compete with Nvidia's H100. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. For a closer look at the chip sector, I want to bring in Brian Colello. He is Morningstar's equity strategist. Brian, great to speak with you this morning. Talk to me about this potential competition coming in from China, specifically Huawei here. To what extent is that a real headwind for Nvidia? Oh, I think the headwind is in place and I think it's pretty much game over for Nvidia in China. I think the ban of the H200 was probably the final straw of Nvidia being able to sell anything halfway decent into China, and I would expect that Huawei's products will probably be uh higher quality than uh the older products that Nvidia has been shipping or the H200 uh, if not today, then at some point in the new few in the near future. So I do think Nvidia is pretty much cut off, and and I do think of Nvidia from here on out is much more of a uh developed market story. There's still plenty of growth in the US, Europe, um so I I'm much more focused on on those markets at this point. Brian, I had to check the transcript when I sat down in my new seat over here to make sure I heard you correctly. You are very bearish Nvidia China business specifically off the back of this news. What do you think that initiates for Nvidia? Do you think they potentially spin off the China business at some point, or do you think they just cut their losses and invest in other markets? Well, I I think they already have a five and a half billion dollar write-off, and we'll hear from them more in in late May, so maybe, you know, it's possible. Maybe there's something they will be shipping, um, but I I think the restrictions have cut the materiality of of the China business in steps, and I think this H200 uh cut and the five and a half billion write-off is um as close to the final straw as I could think of. I think they just walk away and focus on the US. And talk to me as As long as um as long as they can, I mean, there's if the restrictions get lifted, Nvidia would love to be back there, but I I just don't think the US uh government will let them, quite frankly. So then, what does that mean for American investors, especially as we do head towards those Nvidia earnings? Do you think that there is still a bull case for this name in the short term? Absolutely. I think Nvidia is still selling everything they can make on the Grace Blackwell side. Um there's still tremendous growth from the hyperscalers, Google, Microsoft, etc. We're seeing few signs, if any, that they're really slowing spending in 2025. It seems like they're buying all the Blackwells they can for this year because of the performance improvements, and we're still skeptical that US companies are going to slow down their AI investments, even with the recession. AI is the future. It is uh certainly a race right now, uh and we think that spending continues in the short term. So I think Nvidia is set up. Now, China uh could be a hit, so maybe we do see um, you know, less earnings growth this year, less revenue growth, I maybe even revenues down quarter over quarter because of the big China hit. We'll see on that, but everything else should be pretty good, and there's still a lot to be bullish about for the US and AI in the future.";"News";"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/game-over-nvidia-china-huaweis-155523767.html?.tsrc=rss"
"2025-04-28 15:56:18";"Nvidia faces a new threat from Huawei";"Chinese tech giant Huawei is getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia (NVDA), according to a new report. Huawei Technologies will receive its first shipment of Ascend 910E chips from manufacturers as soon as the end of May, theWall Street Journalreported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The processor is Huawei’s most powerful AI semiconductor to date. According to the report, Huawei is hopeful that the chips will be more powerful than Nvidia’s H100 AI training chip, which it released in 2022. The Shenzhen-based firm boosts the chip’s performance by packing in more silicon. Shares of Nvidia were down about 3.5% by late Monday morning. The chip is in the early stages of development and will need to undergo testing with an initial batch of customers to measure its performance, the sources said. Huawei, one of China’s biggest tech companies, has made persistent technological advances in recent years despite U.S. sanctions against it. The firm has been on a U.S.-trade blacklist for six years, and the U.S. restricts chipmakers from selling certain chip technologies to Chinese firms in an effort to curb the country’s advancements with AI chip technology. The tightening restrictions under both the Biden and Trump administrations have dealt blows to Nvidia by limiting its potential market. Nvidia designed its H20 chip, in particular,to complywith U.S. export rules — but those rules became even stricter and barred the Santa Clara, California-based company from selling them in China. Beijing has slammed the U.S.’ approach and President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. Earlier this month, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable chipmaker with a market capitalization of about $2.6 trillion. But its shares are down 22.5% this year in the face of Trump’s escalating trade war with China. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

"2025-04-28 16:00:00";"4 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term";"Wall Street has seen significant volatility in 2025, triggered by fears of a potential recession and new rounds of tariff wars. However, this market turmoil can also offer an opportunity to quietly compound your long-term wealth. If you look beyond the daily panic, you will notice a few companies that are demonstrating healthy top-line growth while maintaining substantial competitive moats in their respective markets. Here's whyNvidia(NVDA-3.72%),Microsoft(MSFT-0.57%),Super Micro Computer(SMCI0.27%), andServiceNow(NOW-1.75%)are worth buying and holding for the long run. At the time of this writing, shares of Nvidia are down nearly 31% from their January peak. Yet the business has not weakened. It is still going strong. The company's recently launched Blackwell chips represent a dramatic leap in artificial intelligence (AI) computing capabilities. Compared to previous Hopper architecture chips, they deliver impressive performance at a much lower cost when handling large inferencing AI workloads. This means faster results and lower client costs, translating into high enterprise demand. Blackwell has already generated over $11 billion in revenue during the most recent quarter. Nvidia has also evolved from a gaming-focused chip player to a full-stack AI infrastructure giant, with a robust software ecosystem and networking infrastructure. The company is also focusing on upcoming AI opportunities in areas like agentic AI, physical AI, and autonomous driving. Not surprisingly,Bank of Americaanalysts see the company's addressable AI infrastructure market reach at around $2 trillion. Nvidia is still in the early stages of capitalizing on this tremendous opportunity. Microsoft has also emerged as a dominant AI player and is already monetizing its AI assets. Microsoft's primary profit driver, the Azure cloud computing platform, continues to be a major growth catalyst. Recently, however, Azure AI infrastructure services have been pivotal in attracting developers, businesses, and enterprises to the Azure ecosystem. The company's AI-powered Copilot assistant, integrated across several of its flagship offerings, is also a very promising AI initiative. Copilot is helping attract new customers and increase usage frequency among large enterprises. The company is also at the forefront of the next-generation quantum computing technology, with initiatives such as the Majorana 1 chip and advances in quantum virtualization software. Microsoft also differentiates itself from several of its peers based on its robust financial structure. The company's mostly subscription-based diversified business model is a significant strength in the current volatile environment. And here's where it gets interesting: Even with all this momentum, the company is trading at 25.9 timesforward earnings-- below its five-year average of 33 times. That disconnect may not last long. But it offers a smart opportunity to pick up this stock now. Super Micro Computer's leading position in the AI server market and its dominance in liquid cooling technology have made it a significant beneficiary of the explosive demand in the global AI infrastructure market, estimated to be over $200 billion by 2028. Super Micro Computer lowered its guidance for fiscal 2025 but remains confident about reaching $40 billion  in revenues in fiscal 2026, implying around 65% year-over-year growth from its current-year forecasts. The company expects strong demand for air-cooled and liquid-cooled AI configurations, equipped with Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs. Super Micro Computer is also working on increasing manufacturing capacity at its U.S., Taiwan, and Malaysia sites. Since utilization is just 55% in the U.S., 60% in Taiwan, and only 1% in Malaysia, there is a lot of room to grow. Although the company faces multiple challenges, including margin pressures, intensifying competition, and damaged investor trust due to historical compliance and governance issues, there is still much to like about this stock. ServiceNow's cloud-based digital workflow automation platform, known as the Now platform, has positioned the company as a key beneficiary of the growing adoption of digitization across enterprises. The company's software solutions are used to automate and streamline technology, CRM, industry, core business, and creator workflows across industry verticals such as healthcare, manufacturing, and the U.S. public sector. Thanks to the diversified business model, the company is not overtly reliant on any particular industry or workflow. ServiceNow has delivered impressive financial performance, with subscription revenues rising 20%  year over year and current remaining performance obligations (the current portion of future revenue backlog) growing 22% year over year in the recent quarter (first quarter fiscal 2025 ending March 31, 2025). The company's AI initiatives are also gaining momentum. This is evident since the number of ServiceNow Pro Plus deals (which offer advanced generative AI capabilities integrated into the Now Assist suite) more than quadrupled year over year in the first quarter. The company's next-generation AI-optimized database, RaptorDB, also gained traction and won five deals over $1 million. Finally, the company's planned acquisitions, Moveworks and Logik.ai, are further expected to strengthen its AI capabilities. ServiceNow is trading at a forward P/E of 47.8, which is not cheap. However, the stock seems a worthwhile buy now considering its robust fundamentals and the valuation, which is dramatically lower than its five-year average of 235.2 times.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/28/4-brilliant-growth-stocks-to-buy-now-and-hold-for/?.tsrc=rss"

"2025-04-28 16:48:21";"Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Most Profitable Blue Chip Stock to Buy Now?";"We recently published a list of10 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other most profitable blue chip stocks to buy now. Blue chip stocks are large, financially stable companies with strong market presence, consistent profitability, and regular dividend payments. They are generally market leaders, with strong business models that are resilient across business cycles. Many blue chip stocks are included in the Dow Index (DJIA), so the index is often considered an indicator of their overall performance. Investors would typically flock to blue chip stocks in times of market volatility, economic uncertainty, or when the economy is in late-stage expansion, as these large-cap companies tend to offer stability and consistent returns versus smaller or riskier companies. We believe that blue chip stocks, and the constituents of the Dow index in particular, represent a unique blend of the value and size factors, combining the financial stability, earnings consistency, and attractive market valuations typically associated with value stocks, with the scale and market dominance of large-cap companies. This dual exposure enhances their resilience in economic downturns and makes them well-positioned to outperform during recessions, when investors tend to shift towards quality and safer stocks. For reference, the Fama–French Three-Factor Model, introduced in 1993, concludes that incorporating exposure to several favorable factors can further enhance stock returns. In this context, both the value and large size factors outperformed in the last years, and especially year-to-date. READ ALSO:10 Most Profitable Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now Our research indicates that recession fears and Trump Turmoil are likely to persist and potentially continue to favor the most profitable blue chip stocks over everything else. The US administration appears to be eroding the trust of investors through a plethora of unpredictable and contradictory moves – Trump appeared to soften his stance on the US-China trade war, saying that tariffs on Chinese goods “will not be as high as 145 per cent” and that “it’ll come down substantially, but won’t be zero”. While this represents a good signal at first glance, such actions are very likely to deter the US’s partners from negotiating for tariff exemption, simply because the current administration has become too unpredictable. Our thoughts are confirmed by the VIX volatility index remaining elevated compared to the long-term trend, while the crude oil price remains in a downtrend, suggesting expectations of weaker industrial demand and a weaker economy. On the consumer side, there are reasons to believe that US consumers are getting more cautious than ever – the employee quits rate, as reported by FRED, declined substantially year-to-date and reached levels comparable to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. When employees are reluctant to quit it means two things: (1) it is tough to get jobs out there, implying that the economy is slowing down, and (2) their expectation about the future becomes more pessimistic, which leads to less willingness to quit and potentially risk difficulties finding a new job. Both these factors mean the consumer spending will likely slow down in the following quarters, further pressuring GDP growth. The key takeaway for the readers is that the odds of a recession and of a prolonged bear market still persist. In this context, the best hedging strategy would be to hold shares of companies that perform well in bull markets, but at the same time can offer protection against turmoil and recessions. Our belief is that the most profitable blue chip stocks are the best candidates, because they possess the wide moat and strong cash flow capacity to withstand any economic slowdown and even potentially absorb the incremental tariffs.  To compile our list of most profitable blue chip stocks to buy now, we screened for current and former members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and identified companies with the highest net income generated in the latest reported fiscal year. From that group, we picked companies with the highest net profit margin, which suggests sound financial health and excellent cost management. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their net profit margin as of the most recent quarter. For each stock, we also included the number of hedge funds that own the stock as of Q4 2024, according to Insider Monkey’s database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2025, with quarterly revenue of $39.3 billion, up 78% YoY, and full year revenue of $130.5 billion, up 114%. The company’s Data Center segment was the primary driver, more than doubling to $115.2 billion for the full year. Demand for AI chips and systems remains extremely strong as customers race to build out AI infrastructure. NVDA successfully ramped production of its new Blackwell architecture, delivering $11 billion in Blackwell revenue in Q4 despite some initial delays. Looking ahead, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects continued strong growth in fiscal 2026, forecasting Q1 revenue of $43 billion. The company sees multiple drivers of AI compute demand, including pre-training of larger multimodal models, post-training techniques like reinforcement learning, and inference scaling for reasoning AI that can require 100x more compute per task. The company is positioning itself to address the full spectrum of AI workloads from cloud to enterprise with its Blackwell platform. While gross margins are expected to dip initially with the Blackwell ramp, management expects them to recover to the mid-70% range later in the fiscal year as manufacturing efficiencies improve. With high margins and a wide technological edge, NVDA is undoubtedly one of the most profitable stocks in the world. Overall, NVDAranks 1ston our list of most profitable blue chip stocks to buy now.

Investors this week will search results from Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. for signs of how they’re being affected by tariff developments. News that China’s Huawei Technologies Co. is set to test a new chip to rival Nvidia Corp. also hurt sentiment. Short-term Treasuries outperformed. The dollar fell. Subscribe to the Stock Movers Podcast on Apple, Spotify and other Podcast Platforms. From jobs to inflation and economic growth, the pace of high-profile data will be just as strong this week. After cruising along comfortably for most of last year, the world’s largest economy lost altitude at the start of 2025 as consumers tired and the trade deficit ballooned on a tariff-related scramble for imports. With a jittery April near a close, several market pros see little reason to think volatility is in the rearview mirror. For equities to extend the recent rally, investors would need to see the White House follow through on the “dovish pivot” toward trade with China, according to Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “We expect a choppy market in the intermediate term that could be rangebound until clarity is achieved on what effect tariffs have on corporate earnings, which as of now remains very unclear,” said Brian Buetel at UBS Wealth Management. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that “all aspects” of the US government are in contact with China but that it’s up to Beijing to take the first step in de-escalating the tariff fight with the US due to the imbalance of trade between the two nations. “Underneath the surface, key risks persist — trade tensions, recession worries, and monetary policy uncertainties are very much alive,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “The ongoing US-China trade talks remain a pivotal factor.” Among corporate highlights, International Business Machines Corp. plans to invest $150 billion in the US over the next five years, joining a cohort of companies that have announced spending commitments following Trump’s election and tariff threats. Alphabet Inc. is offering about $4 billion of US high-grade corporate bonds on Monday. Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson says the weak dollar will support US corporate earnings, helping the American stock market to outperform the rest of the world. Yet Wilson expects the S&P 500 to remain in the 5,000 to 5,500 range. A more substantial increase would require a tariff deal with China, clear rebound in earnings estimates and the possibility of easier monetary policy, he wrote. US stocks are likely to remain rangebound, with attention veering between positive trade headlines and worries about a recession, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists, who recommend selling any rebounds.

This partnership, alongside other enterprise initiatives, comes during a volatile period for tech stocks. While NVIDIA's share price increased by 15% over the past week, driven by positive market trends, it's notable that the broader market was similarly buoyant, gaining 7%. As markets face upcoming economic data releases and major earnings reports, NVIDIA's strategic moves, including its partnership with Trend Micro, provided additional resilience amid fluctuating tech sector performance. We've spotted 2 possible red flags for NVIDIA you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored. Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value. NVIDIA's recent collaboration with Trend Micro aims to strengthen its security offerings by integrating with NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI Enterprise software. This development could support NVIDIA's push into AI-driven markets, enhancing its appeal in data center and automotive sectors. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return, including share price appreciation and dividends, was very large at 1,430%. This performance underscores its growth trajectory compared to the broader semiconductor sector, which experienced more modest gains over the past year. The tie-up with Trend Micro is likely to bolster NVIDIA’s revenue and earnings prospects by expanding its footprint in AI and computing services. Analysts anticipate revenue and earnings growth rates that reflect this potential, with forecasts indicating a continued upward trend. However, challenges like regulatory issues and component costs could impact margins. With the current share price at US$98.89, there is a substantial discount relative to the consensus analyst price target of US$164.74, illustrating a potential opportunity for investors if future growth estimates are met. Such a price movement suggests optimism regarding NVIDIA's strategic partnerships and product innovation. Upon reviewing our latest valuation report, NVIDIA's share price might be too pessimistic.

Some shipments have already been completed, these sources said, Reuters said. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The move comes as Chinese artificial intelligence companies scramble to secure domestic alternatives after the United States restricted access to Nvidia's (NVDA,Financials) latest chips. Washington recently informed Nvidia that sales of its H20 chips to China would require an export license, following earlier curbs that blocked the H100 chip's sale to Chinese buyers before its release in 2022. Huawei's 910C chip builds on its existing 910B model by combining two processors into a single unit through advanced integration, according to sources familiar with its design. While not viewed as a technological breakthrough, the new chip doubles computing power and memory compared to the earlier generation and includes enhancements for handling a wider range of artificial intelligence tasks. Consultancy firm Albright Stonebridge Group said Huawei's Ascend 910C is positioned to become a primary choice for Chinese developers building AI models and deploying inference capabilities following the latest U.S. restrictions. Huawei began offering 910C samples to select Chinese technology firms late last year and started accepting commercial orders soon after. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. is reported to be producing some components of the 910C using its N+2 7-nanometer process technology. However, yield rates remain low, according to sources. Some of Huawei's chips are believed to incorporate semiconductors originally manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for China-based Sophgo, sources added. The U.S. Commerce Department is investigating TSMC's past dealings after chips made for Sophgo were found inside Huawei's 910B processors. TSMC said it complies with all regulatory requirements and has not supplied Huawei directly since September 2020.

Meanwhile, therelative strength index (RSI)points to neutral conditions, providing a reading around the 50 threshold. Let’s identify several importantsupport and resistancelevels on Meta's chart. Investors should initially keep track of the $482 level. Apullbackto this area would likely attract buying interest near the prominent April troughs that form the potential double bottom pattern. It’s worth pointing out that this location also sits in the same neighborhood as the 38.2%Fibonacci retirement levelwhen applying a grid from the February high to April low.
