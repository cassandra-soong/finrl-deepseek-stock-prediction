"2025-03-15 17:55:00";"The situation of the market";"Many stocks in the market are significantly overvalued‚ÄîTesla, Apple, Costco, Palantir, and much of the FMCG and pharmaceutical sectors, considering their sluggish growth. Even Nvidia could see its valuation tumble if China or AMD develop viable alternatives.

Market crashes don‚Äôt worry me; they‚Äôre necessary and often present great buying opportunities. What truly concerns me is the long-term effect of excess liquidity. Inflation is brewing beneath the surface, and we‚Äôll see its full impact in the years ahead. Over time, the velocity of money has declined while the money supply has surged, artificially propping up asset prices. My real fear isn‚Äôt a crash‚Äîit‚Äôs that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.

Bonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn‚Äôt a market for investors‚Äîit‚Äôs a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.

If inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins. After years of zero interest rates and relentless quantitative easing, my biggest concern is that when the real downturn hits, the Fed will have little ammunition left to respond.";"Reddit";"https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc0xk4/the_situation_of_the_market/"

üî∑ Apple dropped more than 10%.
üî∑ Nvidia surged nearly 8%. 
üî∑ Intel had a strong performance after announcing a new CEO and gaining over 16% in a week.

Overall, this week was negative.

Day-by-Day Standouts;
Monday: Selling pressure was extremely strong. The Nasdaq dropped 727 points. It's biggest single-day decline since COVID crash on Mar. 16, 2020. üî¥
Tuesday: A quiet day. The stock market awaited key data releases on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. But, it's slightly negative. üî¥
Wednesday: CPI was released. The monthly estimate was 0.3%, but it came to 0.2%. The yearly estimate was 2.9%, but it dropped to 2.8%. This was perfect for stock market, because it's increased expectations of a rate cut. As a result, stock markets are surged more than 1%. üü¢
Tuesday: After CPI, PPI also came in below estimates. Core PPI turned negative (-0.1%) and the yearly dropped from 3.6% to 3.4%. However, tariff concerns created pressure and then the stock market dropped 2%. üî¥
Friday: The government shutdown reduced fears. The stock market jumped 2% to close the week on a strong. üü¢

S&P500 hit 6147 on February 19, 2025, but has now dropped to 5,638.94. The lowest level at this week was 5,504.65. That means, the index dropped slight more than 10%. S&P500 is below the 200-day EMA. 

If we can get 2 day consecutive positive close, some of money from other assets like gold may join the game into the stock market. For now, economic data supports the stock market, but we shouldn't forget that President Trump‚Äôs is more important than all the data and technical indicators.

"2025-03-16 12:51:00";"Convince me I shouldn't be a bear now, pt. 2.";"Three weeks ago, I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iu1jy7/convince_me_i_shouldnt_be_a_bear_now/) post. There, I made an argument why markets were overpriced due to valuations and the actions of the current administration.

I am still worried, and I'm wondering what are the counter-arguments. 

1. Valuations are still high. 
2. Trump admin and Musk are pushing austerity via spending cuts/mass layoffs. 
3. Unstable tariff policy. Companies and consumers can't plan ahead. April 2 is coming. More chaos or clarity?
4. Soft data has been terrible. 
5. High-frequency and corporate data (travel, retail) all point to a rapidly deteriorating consumer. 

All of that makes me worried we are headed for a recession. Banks seem to agree and have upped their forecasts for one. Three months ago this would have been laughable. 

Granted, this can all change on a tweet. The trump team can pivot, make tariffs more clear & targeted, and Doge can become more work and less theater. Then, we can get to beneficial tax policies & deregulation.

I'm concerned that's not gonna happen. 

I'm concerned that Trump tariffs wont make companies move to the US & create jobs as Trump, Lutnick, and Bessent think they will. I'm concerned that people will get fired and become more poor, things will get more expensive, and Trump team will have nothing to show for it. 


Now, to positioning & stocks:

I've been buying things that will benefit from protectionist policies, like INTC and X. I've also bought the dip on several big tech names & then sold them on Friday after the rally. Why? Take Nvidia, for example. Great company, but if chips aren't excluded from tariffs, then Nvidia's profit margins would get slashed. So would the valuation.

I'm sitting on a lump of cash & am waiting for more clarity, whether it's up or down.

They‚Äôre normal."". As a result, the futures market opened negative. However, after the U.S. Stock Market opened, The S&P 500 turned positive. On the Nasdaq side, Tesla dragged the index down and dropped more than 6%. It recovered some losses by the end of the day.

The S&P500 hit 6,147 on February 19. Then the index dropped 5,504 on March 13. It remains below the 200-day EMA. Compared to the previous 2 times on below, if the market made 2 consecutive positive closes, the uptrend will continue. Today, The S&P 500 hit 5.703 which is the 200-day EMA and then declined. It closed at at 5,677. I think, we can hit the 50-day EMA at around 5,850 at least.

What do you think? The market is highly bearish, but could this fear fuel a bull market? We have already faced tariffs. Are they fully priced in?

"2025-03-18 18:40:00";"Nvidia announces Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin AI chips";"Nvidia announced new chips for building and deploying artificial intelligence models at its annual GTC conference on Tuesday. 

CEO Jensen Huang revealed Blackwell Ultra, a family of chips shipping in the second half of this year, as well as Vera Rubin, the company‚Äôs next-generation graphics processing unit, or GPU, that is expected to ship in 2026.

Nvidia‚Äôs sales are up more than sixfold since its business was transformed by the release of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT in late 2022. That‚Äôs because its ‚Äúbig GPUs‚Äù have most of the market for developing advanced AI, a process called training.

Software developers and investors are closely watching the company‚Äôs new chips to see if they offer enough additional performance and efficiency to convince the company‚Äôs biggest end customers ‚Äî cloud companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon ‚Äî to continue spending billions of dollars to build data centers based around Nvidia chips.

Tuesday‚Äôs announcements are also a test of Nvidia‚Äôs new annual release cadence. The company is striving to announce new chips on an every-year basis. Before the AI boom, Nvidia released new chips every other year. 

The GTC conference in San Jose, California, is also a show of strength for Nvidia. 

The event, Nvidia‚Äôs second in-person conference since the pandemic, is expected to have 25,000 attendees and hundreds of companies discussing the ways they use the company‚Äôs hardware for AI. That includes Waymo, Microsoft and Ford, among others. 

Nvidia will also showcase its other products and services at the event. 

For example, Nvidia announced new laptops and desktops using its chips, including two AI-focused PCs that will be able to run large AI models such as Llama or DeepSeek. The company also announced updates to its networking parts for tying hundreds or thousands of GPUs together so they work as one.

Vera Rubin

Nvidia said on Tuesday that it expects to start shipping systems on its next-generation GPU family in the second half of 2026. 

The system has two main components: a CPU, called Vera, and a new GPU design, called Rubin. It‚Äôs named after astronomer Vera Rubin.

Vera is Nvidia‚Äôs first custom CPU design, the company said, and it‚Äôs based on a core design they‚Äôve named Olympus. 

Previously when it needed CPUs, Nvidia used an off-the-shelf design from Arm. Companies that have developed custom Arm core designs, such as Qualcomm and Apple, say that they can be more tailored and unlock better performance.

The custom Vera design will be twice as fast as the CPU used in last year‚Äôs Grace Blackwell chips, the company said. 

When paired with Vera, Rubin can manage 50 petaflops while doing inference, more than double the 20 petaflops for the company‚Äôs current Blackwell chips. Rubin can also support as much as 288 gigabytes of fast memory, which is one of the core specs that AI developers watch.

Nvidia is also making a change to what it calls a GPU. Rubin is actually two GPUs, Nvidia said. 

The Blackwell GPU, which is currently on the market, is actually two separate chips that were assembled together and made to work as one chip.

Starting with Rubin, Nvidia will say that when it combines two or more dies to make a single chip, it will refer to them as separate GPUs. In the second half of 2027, Nvidia plans to release a ‚ÄúRubin Next‚Äù chip that combines four dies to make a single chip, doubling the speed of Rubin, and it will refer to that as four GPUs.

Nvidia said that will come in a rack called Vera Rubin NVL144. Previous versions of Nvidia‚Äôs rack were called NVL72.

Blackwell Ultra

Nvidia also announced new versions of its Blackwell family of chips that it calls Blackwell Ultra.

That chip will be able to produce more tokens per second, which means that the chip can generate more content in the same amount of time as its predecessor, Nvidia said in a briefing.

Nvidia says that means that cloud providers can use Blackwell Ultra to offer a premium AI service for time-sensitive applications, allowing them to make as much as 50 times the revenue from the new chips as the Hopper generation, which shipped in 2023.

Blackwell Ultra will come in a version with two paired to an Nvidia Arm CPU, called GB300, and a version with just the GPU, called B300. It will also come in versions with eight GPUs in a single server blade and a rack version with 72 Blackwell chips.

The top four cloud companies have deployed three times the number of Blackwell chips as Hopper chips, Nvidia said.

DeepSeek

China‚Äôs DeepSeek R1 model may have scared Nvidia investors when it was released in January, but Nvidia has embraced the software. The chipmaker will use the model to benchmark several of its new products.

Many AI observers said that DeepSeek‚Äôs model, which reportedly required fewer chips than models made in the U.S., threatened Nvidia‚Äôs business.

But Huang said earlier this year that DeepSeek was actually a good sign for Nvidia. That‚Äôs because DeepSeek uses a process called ‚Äúreasoning,‚Äù which requires more computing power to provide users better answers. 

The new Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin chips are better for reasoning models, Nvidia said. 

It‚Äôs developed its chips to more efficiently do inference, so when new reasoning models require more computing power at the time of deployment, Nvidia‚Äôs chips will be able to handle it.

‚ÄúIn the last 2-3 years, a major breakthrough happened, a fundamental advance in artificial intelligence happened, we call it agentic AI,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúIt can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem.‚Äù

"2025-03-19 01:55:00";"Nvidia, GM announce deal for AI, factories and next-gen vehicles";"General Motors and Nvidia have agreed to a strategic collaboration that includes the automaker using several products and artificial intelligence services from the tech giant for its next-generation vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems and factories.

The companies on Tuesday announced that the new initiatives include building custom artificial intelligence systems using Nvidia compute platforms, including ‚ÄúOmniverse with Cosmos,‚Äù for optimizing GM‚Äôs factory planning and robotics.

The Detroit automaker also said it will use ‚ÄúNvidia Drive AGX‚Äù for ‚Äúin-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences.‚Äù

GM declined to disclose a cost for the new tools with Nvidia. The tech company has been attempting to diversify its automotive business, which has notably included substantial work in data centers and GPUs.

‚ÄúThe era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we‚Äôre transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they‚Äôre made,‚Äù Jensen Huang, Nvidia founder and CEO, said in a release. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to partner with GM to build AI systems tailored to their vision, craft and know-how.‚Äù

GM has been using Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, for training AI models across various areas of its business, including simulation and validation. The new business expands to in-vehicle hardware, automotive plant design and operations, the companies said.

The automaker also had been testing Nvidia‚Äôs Omniverse since at least 2022. Some of GM‚Äôs testing was in designing a ‚Äúdigital twin,‚Äù or replica, of its new design center and processes to assist virtual vehicle development. It also acted as a single digital environment for employees to work and collaborate in, according to a video last year featuring GM for Nvidia‚Äôs GTC developer conference in 2023.

Nvidia anticipated it would strike a deal with GM mid-last year for Omniverse, according to an internal company email viewed by CNBC. At that time, two sources with GM signaled the automaker wasn‚Äôt sure Nvidia‚Äôs software and GPUs were worth the high cost compared with other companies.

It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear what sealed the deal for GM. But since that time, both companies have experienced increased¬†competition from China¬†and uncertain regulatory changes such as tariffs. GM‚Äôs stock is off roughly 8% during in 2025, while Nvidia is off about 12% this year.

‚ÄúAI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,‚Äù GM CEO¬†Mary Barra¬†said in Nvidia‚Äôs release. ‚ÄúBy merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.‚Äù

The companies announced the new initiatives in connection with Nvidia‚Äôs¬†GTC AI conference¬†this week in California.

Nvidia describes Omniverse as a platform for ‚Äúdeveloping and deploying physically based industrial digitalization applications.‚Äù It‚Äôs essentially connecting a physical environment with a digital, or software, world to optimize processes using a ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù of a physical environment such as a GM design facility or plant.

Users of Nvidia‚Äôs Omniverse have included BMW,¬†Amazon¬†Robotics and Samsung,¬†Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology, said during a media briefing a year ago. He said the company was licensing Omniverse for $4,500 per GPU, per year.

It‚Äôs unclear how many GPUs GM will need. But given the amount of robotics, sensors and other systems needed to operate a modern assembly plant, it would likely be quite a bit.

More than¬†20¬†other automakers have used Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúsystem on a chip‚Äù hardware in the central computing units of their smart vehicles, including Mercedes Benz, Volvo, Audi, Volkswagen and BYD, according to an industry equity research note from Jeffries in November 2023.

In recent years, Nvidia has seen soaring demand for its GPUs, which are used for everything from bitcoin mining to AI inference and training.

His latest moves‚Äî25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy‚Äîecho his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

‚Ä¢ **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed‚Äôs job harder.

‚Ä¢ **China‚Äôs response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**‚Äîthis could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

‚Ä¢ **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it‚Äôs still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** ‚Äì Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** ‚Äì ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** ‚Äì If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** ‚Äì If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** ‚Äì Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** ‚Äì Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** ‚Äì Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** ‚Äì If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I‚Äôm watching:**

üìå Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

üìå Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

üìå Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

üìå Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

That also means, until I ride the 100 P/E wave my only way to get profit is a pyramide scheme.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he didn‚Äôt realize there were publicly traded quantum-computing companies when he made earlier comments that caused industry stocks to crash.

‚ÄúMy first reaction was, I didn‚Äôt know they were public. How can a quantum company be public?‚Äù Huang said at an event Thursday focused on the still-nascent technology.

The executive had said in January that ‚Äúvery useful‚Äù quantum computers are probably decades away, causing shares of IonQ Inc. and other companies to tumble. Thursday‚Äôs event ‚Äî part of Nvidia‚Äôs weeklong GTC conference ‚Äî invited some of those very companies on stage to discuss their prospects with Huang.

The quantum-computing industry aims to use the unique properties of subatomic particles to process data much faster than traditional semiconductor-based electronics. The technical difficulties of building practical systems have meant that the field is still in an experimental stage. In addition to quantum upstarts, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google are also trying find practical uses for quantum systems.

The companies on stage at Thursday‚Äôs event included IonQ and D-Wave Quantum Inc. Huang said it was natural for this new form of computing to take many years to develop since it was so novel. The companies might be able to convince him that quantum computing is happening more quickly than he expected, he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he joked.

‚ÄúThis whole session is going to be like a therapy session for me,‚Äù he said.

The six company leaders on stage gave him a variety of answers. Some argued that quantum computers are already in use to solve difficult science problems. Others posited that the technology is even closer to helping advance traditional computing.

Executives also said it wasn‚Äôt unreasonable to spend a decade honing a technology that will have such a large impact. Loic Henriet, who runs the French company Pasqal, argued that the term ‚Äúquantum computing‚Äù was misleading. Quantum processors will help act as accelerators ‚Äî working alongside traditional computers ‚Äî rather than replacing them, he said.

"2025-03-21 00:54:00";"Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025";"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven ‚Äî which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) ‚Äî is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week.

Don‚Äôt ever get shaken out of your conviction. In trading and life. Tough lesson here but I had to exit this trade due to life circumstances after holding Nvidia for 3 years in sideways action.  I believe these shares would be the equivalent of about $0.43 after splits.

  
I knew the potential of Nvidia in the 90s/early 2000s when I was in high school. I was building gaming computers with their chips after them taking over 3dfx (Voodoo line). My thought was if the GPU is the most important element for gaming and being able to do rapid fire complicated calculations, what is the end game for Nvidia? Well, we know the rest of the story of where that led. So, in 2011 when I started really learning about the stock market, I bought shares and just held it. I had to sell due to a large purchase and at the time, was money better utilized as the frustration of holding no movement in either direction finally got to me.";"Reddit";"https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jha3wo/a_nvidia_trade_from_2011_that_became_one_of_my/"

Over the last two days, I rolled 30 of 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps (cash secured puts) to NVDA 5/16 120 csps and received an additional $11k premium. Wrote another 30 NVDA 5/16 110 csps for $9k premium. Altogether 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps and 30 NVDA 5/16 120 csps for a total of $35k premium. I picked the expiration to be one week before earnings so the premiums are not inflated by earnings and I would like to have the option to make another earnings play if the price is around $120.

After factoring in premiums, the average cost to purchase is $105 and $115 respectively. I picked $110 and $120 because NVDA‚Äôs lower range is around $110 and upper range is around $140, so in the worst case (of my) scenario, I would be purchasing NVDA at the lower end of the range. If I‚Äôm wrong, then NVDA is a good stock to hold long term.

I don‚Äôt need to bore anyone to list all of the reasons NVDA is a buy including exploding need and revenue from data centers; just beginning to scratch surface on AI in automobiles/partnership with AI companies; growing domestic revenue (47% 63B revenue) that won‚Äôt be impacted by AI restrictions‚Ä¶

Worst case scenario, NVDA tanks below $110 and I am forced to buy 7,000 more shares. In that case I will just hold on to a stock that I am confident will double in 5 years.

Micron (MU) and Samsung for flash storage (NAND SSDs).

NVIDIA (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) for GPUs and CPUs powering AI workloads.  Nvidia obviously gets all the attention right now.

"2025-03-28 03:07:00";"CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)";"# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).

CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an ‚ÄúAI hyperscaler.‚Äù They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.

CRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services‚Äã. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.

CRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.‚Äã Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver‚Äã.

Companies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past‚Äã. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called ‚ÄúSUNK‚Äù and an optimizer ‚ÄúTensorizer‚Äù) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.

In practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.

**The NVDA Relationship**

NVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.

**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**

Kind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9‚ÄØB for GPU cloud capacity‚Äã. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. 

**The Financials**

CRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8‚ÄØM (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.

By 2024, CRWV neared $2‚ÄØB in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.

The financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \~$600M, and in 2024m \~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).

The S-1 shows operating costs close to \~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.

The cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.

**Customer Concentration**

In 2023, Microsoft accounted for \~35% of CRWV‚Äôs revenue‚Äã. In 2024, that grew to \~62% of total revenue‚Äã. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).

**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.

However, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030‚Äã, which averages out to \~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV‚Äôs revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Beyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.

**IPO Technicals**

CRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation‚Äã. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.

**Valuation/Comparables**

Is a \~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:

|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92‚ÄØB|\~$20B (target IPO)|\~10√ó|
|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41‚ÄØB‚Äã|\~$52‚ÄØB (market cap)|\~15√ó ‚Äã|
|**Databricks**\*|\~$3‚ÄØB by end of 2025|\~$62‚ÄØB ‚Äã|\~20√ó|
|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6‚ÄØB‚Äã|\~$500‚ÄØB|\~4-5√ó|

(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \*Also note that Databricks is a private company

I think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3√ó growth for a couple more years), then an 10√ó multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \~$4‚ÄØB+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.

CRWV‚Äôs valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**

This valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.

**IPO Trading Details**

37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).

Overall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.

**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.

"2025-03-28 03:19:00";"I believe that Coreweave is already underwater, and their IPO is an exit strategy for existing shareholders:";"Coreweave is set to launch its IPO tomorrow at $40 per share. Its NVDIA backing sounds promising, but balance sheet constraints and shady collateral backing for massive loans can‚Äôt be brushed off.

Coreweave managed to skyrocket into the headlines over the past couple of years after solidifying its position as a significant AI player. This parabolic rise was, in part, thanks to a $2.3b loan collateralized by NVDIA GPUs. However, a simple google search of the collateral posted for this loan, Nvidia H100 tensor core gpu, will likely lead you to the same conclusion illustrated below.

When Coreweave secured an initial $2.3b in cash from investors, they posted NVDA chips as collateral. The rapid cash injection buoyed them onto the AI scene relatively quickly. However, that form of collateral has proven itself to be less than fundamentally sound over the past couple of years.
*Source: (https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/)*

When Coreweave posted the NVDA chips as collateral in 2023, the value was marked-to-market at ~$47,000/processor. That same processor is now worth 30% less. For context - their total loan value came in at a whopping $7.6 billion near the end of 2024. Simply put: technology is advancing quickly, and the collateral is rapidly degrading in value. Additionally, the cost to rent these GPUs is falling - why own the asset when you can rent it for 1/100th the price?

In December of 2024, Coreweave breached terms of their $7.6b loan through various ""unspecified"" actions and ""accidents"". However, their primary lender Blackstone was generous enough to waive these shortcomings and amend their loan.
*Source: (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1015.htm)*

Wildly enough, the cause of the near technical default was found to be due to an overstatement of collateral - Coreweave was alleged to not have tangibly held as many GPUs as they reported. The ""administrative accident"" was Coreweave attempting to sure-up it's reserves as to avoid defaulting on it's obligations.

That same company, ""backed"" by NVDA, will now IPO tomorrow. At $40 per share, the implied value is $19b. As it stands today, that $7.6b loan (that they nearly defaulted on 3 months ago) is nearly 1/2 of their entire market cap.

Just keep that in mind before smashing that buy button tomorrow after the buffer period.

üî∏ Tesla gained 5.93%. The auto tariffs had no impact due to the U.S based production.

üî∏ Ford fell 2.7% and General Motors dropped 6.27% about concerns over supply chains.

üî∏ Berkshire closed slightly positive in the negative conditions. The investors believe Buffett.

üî∏ Semiconductors had significant loses on Wednesday. It's selling pressure on the Nasdaq and the stock market.

üî¥ Nasdaq: 17,322.99 (-2.59%)

üî¥ DJI: 41,583.90 (-0.95%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

üî∏ Monday: The rising continued from the previous week. The indexes broke a 4-week losing streak. The S&P 500 gained over 1.5% and it reached highest rising level for the week. üü¢

üî∏ Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited key data releases on Wednesday and Friday. Consumer Confidence released at 92.9 and its lowest level since February 2021, but it had not impact. The indexes closed slightly positive and extended winning streak to 3-days. üü¢

üî∏ Wednesday: Trump announced new tariff plans for automotive imports. It triggered heavy selling pressure. The indexes lost around 1.5%. üî¥

üî∏ Thursday: The day started with GDP report which decreased from 3.1% to 2.4% (better than the expected 2.3%). There was nothing extra thing and the indexes closed slightly lowered. üî¥

üî∏ Friday: The most important data of the week was PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure). Core PCE was expected at 2.7% YoY, but it exceeded expectations at 2.8%. The PCE is came matched with the expectations. It's 3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. I think, the more important data was 1-year Inflation Expectations. It came 5% and highest value since November 2022. As a result, the indexes lost more than 2%. It was rough day. üî¥

Meanwhile, gold gained over 2% and silver surged more than 3%. Do you invest in them? I bought gold around 2300 and still hold it.

The S&P 500 has retreated approximately¬†**10%**¬†from its peak, hovering at a critical juncture. This week‚Äôs performance will be decisive: If this is merely a healthy correction, markets should rebound strongly and reclaim new highs soon. However, futures markets suggest diminishing odds of such a scenario:

* **Nasdaq futures fell 1.2%**¬†amid reports that Trump is pressuring advisors to escalate tariffs, raising fears of a U.S.-led global trade war.

* **April 2nd**¬†looms as the deadline for the U.S. to unveil new tariff policies, amplifying market anxiety and safe-haven demand.

1. **Reciprocal tariffs only**¬†‚Üí Limited market impact.
2. **Reciprocal tariffs + VAT adjustments**¬†‚Üí U.S. dollar could rally 50-100 basis points, pressuring equities.
3. **Reciprocal tariffs + VAT + sector-specific tariffs**¬†‚Üí Deeper equity market correction.

**Will April 2nd Trigger a Crash?**

But Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett argues the real inflection point may be¬†**April 4th‚Äôs nonfarm payrolls data**. Strong jobs numbers could fuel a rebound, while weak data might push the S&P 500 lower. Hartnett emphasizes that¬†**macro fundamentals**, not short-term policy noise, will ultimately drive markets.

The most important topic in this month is tariffs which will continue to discuss in the next month. Additionally, concerns about AI, recession fears, and mixed economic datas on the negative side.

Today started with selling pressure and hit the 5,488.73. If the index does not recover, we may be looking at more negative month. 

As I mentioned in the title, The S&P 500 extended its losing streak to 2-months. Let's look at the numbers:

Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate.

The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months.

The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022.

The index‚Äôs first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year‚Äôs gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the ‚Äúmagnificent 7,‚Äù have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year.

The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia‚Äôs late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price.";"Reddit";"https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1joht47/stocks_close_out_their_worst_quarter_since_2022/"
"2025-04-01 02:40:00";"Tariffs on Tech";"***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*

***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  


On April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for ""rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America"". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:

***THE POINT:***

  
In 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called ""electronic transmissions"" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the ""internet"".**

  
This ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  
This moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:



[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)

In the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.

  
This framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to ""strike back"":***  


[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)

***THE PROBLEM:***

Nearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. ""services"" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). 

The problem, then, is derived from the following:

[\>50&#37; of the revenue of the S&P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)

NVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.

***The Endgame:*** 

The tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **->** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **->** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **->** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \~50% of all U.S. spending

"2025-04-01 15:01:00";"China‚Äôs 5nm Chip Breakthrough ‚Äì Is NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock at Risk?";"China‚Äôs semiconductor industry is making waves with its 5nm chip development, potentially disrupting the global market. Could this be bad news for NVIDIA (NVDA)? Here‚Äôs what investors should know:

Why This Matters for NVDA

Market Share Threat ‚Äì  Chinese firms (e.g., Huawei, SMIC) successfully mass-produce competitive 5nm chips, NVIDIA‚Äôs dominance in AI/data center GPUs (especially in China) could weaken.

US-China Tech War ‚Äì Export restrictions (A100/H100 bans) already hurt NVIDIA‚Äôs China revenue (\~20% of sales). A viable Chinese alternative would make things worse.

Competition Heats Up ‚Äì Huawei‚Äôs Ascend and other domestic chips are closing the gap in AI performance.

Potential Stock Impact

Short-term: Sentiment-driven dip if markets overreact to ""China threat"" headlines.

Long-term: Depends on whether NVIDIA can out-innovate (e.g., next-gen Blackwell GPUs) and retain non-China demand (cloud/AI boom)

Bottom Line: A real risk, but NVIDIA‚Äôs tech lead and global AI demand might cushion the blow. Would you buy the dip or stay cautious?

Discussion Points:

Is China‚Äôs 5nm chip a real competitor, or just hype?

"2025-04-02 06:47:00";"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.";"Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.";"Reddit";"https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/"
"2025-04-02 14:02:00";"Nvidia-backed CoreWeave is the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021";"We've got a fresh IPO that just hit Nasdaq last Friday and options already trade on this! CoreWeave / $CRWV is a Nvidia-backed cloud AI services provider. $CRWV is one of the first pure-play AI IPOs, offering AI technology in the cloud. It's backers: Nvidia, Fidelity, and Magnetar. Nvidia even anchored the IPO with a $250 million order. 

Financials: CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion in its IPO, the most for a U.S. tech offering since 2021. Revenue last year was $1.92 billion, up 737% from the year before. Growth is undeniable, but there's also a net loss of $863 million reported last year. (D'uh).

Strong Customer Base: Microsoft, Meta, IBM, and Cohere are all customers. Microsoft alone accounts for 62% of CoreWeave's revenue.

The IPO priced below the expected range, opening at $39 and closing at $40. Friday was a shitty day (-3% nasdaq) to IPO.

So, what's the play?

This isn't a short-term YOLO imho, IV is so high it's only good for writing puts. Shares for me, but you do you. Also do your own DD, obviously. Current market price is still kinda close to IPO range.

Positions: 500 shares @ about $54. IV is 170% for April, so good luck if you buy options on this, you'll need it.

For the weeks, I‚Äôve watched my portfolio slowly bleed. Selling options helped cushion the drawdown a bit, and the recent bounce gave me a chance to recover some ground. But personally, **this recent rally feels like a bull trap for the books**. SPY got absolutely no business going 547 - 567.   
In a hope of tarrifs aint gonna be so bad? Well, but the rumors, sell the news.

Well, here we go again. Trump just dropped a massive tariff plan, and the market is in full panic mode. A 10% baseline tariff across the board, plus brutal rates on China (54% effective!), the EU (20%), Vietnam (46%), and Taiwan (32%). The result? Dow futures tanked nearly 1,000 points, the S&P 500 is down big, and tech stocks are getting destroyed. Apple and Tesla? Down 7%. Nvidia? -5%. Even retailers like Dollar Tree and Gap are getting hammered.

If this feels like a rerun of 2018-2019, that‚Äôs because it basically is‚Äîbut worse. Back then, the trade war rattled markets, hurt supply chains, and slowed global growth. Now? We‚Äôre already dealing with sticky inflation and a shaky economy. Traders were hoping for some stability, but instead, they got another wildcard move. (trolling a bit, The market will bounce back sooner or later!)

The real gut punch is China‚Äôs 54% tariff rate. That‚Äôs not a slap on the wrist‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-blown economic war. European stocks are taking a hit too, especially companies like Adidas (-8.6%) and Volvo Cars (-9%). The global reaction is clear: this isn‚Äôt business as usual; this is escalation.

Now the big question: what‚Äôs next? If China and the EU retaliate, things could get uglier fast. The market hates uncertainty, and this is serving it up on a silver platter.

Are we looking at another 2019-style rollercoaster, or is this just an overreaction? Buckle up‚Äîthings are about to get wild. What‚Äôs your take?

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[¬†reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html)¬†the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India ‚Äî all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important¬†[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[¬†like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.¬†[So if this tips us into recession,¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""";"Reddit";"https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/"

Impacted companies off the top of my head would be TSMC, Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Micron, and SK Hynix

But I don't think fabless chip designers really have any options outside of TSMC for cutting edge chips, so at least in the short to medium term I don't see designers flipping to other fabs. 

ASML is another one, unless these tariffs absolutely tank demand for chips (which is certainly plausible), I don't see much impact to them because there are no other alternatives

LIVE UPDATES

U.S. markets suffered their steepest declines since 2020 on fears President Trump‚Äôs new tariff plans will trigger a global trade war and drag the U.S. economy into recession.

Major stock indexes [dropped as much as 6%](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/wall-street-faces-toughest-test-in-years-49174a8b) on Thursday. Stocks lost roughly $3.1 trillion in market value, their [largest one-day decline](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/u-s-stocks-are-headed-for-biggest-wipeout-in-market-value-since-march-2020-VKjYNvHUTrb8kS0D0mG1) since March 2020. Stock-index futures drifted lower Thursday evening, and [stocks in Japan](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/asian-markets-extend-declines-in-wake-of-wall-street-s-plunge-iAuC1BOJfjkdS73r4WBN) were hit for a second day as Friday trading began.

In Thursday's market plunge, the Dow industrials dropped 1679 points, or 4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which powered the market higher for years, was down 6%, pulled lower by big declines in Nvidia, Apple and Amazon.com. The S&P 500, which fell 4.8%, and the other benchmarks suffered their sharpest declines since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The dollar meanwhile tumbled, with the WSJ Dollar Index [suffering its sharpest decline](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-tariffs-us-dollar-217b3dc9) since 2023. The 1.3% fall brought the greenback to its lowest level since October, a sign of unease over the growth outlook and fears that the flow of funds into the country will be sharply curtailed.

Fears that the tariffs will tip the economy toward recession sent investors to the safety of Treasurys. JPMorgan analysts raised their forecast of [the likelihood of a recession](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/jpmorgan-raises-recession-risk-to-60--clWSymXLSyvXZ7fPu6g6) to 60% after the new tariffs were announced.

Some of America‚Äôs allies came out swinging after the details of the U.S. president‚Äôs tariff plans were disclosed late Wednesday. French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe [is weighing retaliation](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/macron-suggests-retaliation-against-u-s-tech-services-for-trump-tariffs-DUYsoG9KHWwS7r6VgwAM) against U.S. tech firms, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country [will match](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/canada-to-hit-u-s-autos-with-retaliatory-tariffs-CH1c2YbcTCDFfbrALCzO) President Trump‚Äôs auto tariffs with 25% tariffs of its own.

Trump took the selloff in stride. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going very well,‚Äù Trump said in response to a question about his tariffs Thursday afternoon. ‚ÄúThe markets are going to boom.‚Äù He left the door open [to making deals](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/trump-on-whether-he-d-make-a-deal-on-tariffs-it-depends--oZod5dqUDqzjtDCuyymX) to lower tariffs, while also [promising new ones](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/trump-previews-chip-pharma-tariffs-q1WBoRT9sCDkcPGkVNlU) on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.

Dozens of household-name stocks posted double-digit declines, including HP, Nike and Target. Stellantis also fell sharply. The Jeep maker said it is [temporarily halting production](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/jeep-maker-stellantis-idles-canadian-mexican-factories-in-response-to-tariffs-SQxpCxe6c8MBWHu02Y3z) at its auto assembly factories in Mexico and Canada.

The turmoil spread beyond stocks, with [oil prices dropping](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/oil-prices-are-crashing-rVu8yDmkuGEWemhrqLYP) more than 6% and investors selling gold after its sharp run over the past year to fresh records.

So far, traders said, selling has been orderly and, though the scale of U.S. tariffs came as a shock, few investors are surprised to see stocks pull back following their gains over the past two years.

Still, the decline sets up financial markets for one of their most precarious periods in recent years, as the tariffs and international reaction test that faith of investors used to sticking with stocks.

**The details on tariffs:**

**All U.S. imports will be subject to a** [**10% tariff**](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/what-to-know-about-trumps-latest-tariff-policy-moves-8d9f8b37), effective April 5.

**Trump will impose even higher rates** on some nations that the White House considers bad actors on trade. For example, Japan faces a 24% duty and the European Union faces a 20% levy, effective April 9.

**China will be hit with** **a** [**new 34% tariff**](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/china-calls-trump-s-tariffs-unilateral-bullying-and-vows-countermeasures-c6ZKGMTXruL01dID4Moe), adding to previous duties, like the 20% tariff Trump imposed over fentanyl. That means the base tariff rate on Chinese imports will be 54%, before adding pre-existing levies.

**The tariffs are pegged** to amounts Trump says other countries impose on the U.S. [Here‚Äôs the math](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/math-behind-new-tariffs-points-to-trade-imbalance-as-key-issue-W4I7vbzaO5qFZS43hAjc) behind the levies

[**Hundreds of products will be exempted**](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/white-house-publishes-hundreds-of-tariff-exemptions-N7o4V7gxmuRUWOROnhqX) from the tariffs, according to a list published by the Trump administration Thursday, including energy products, a variety of minerals, and chemicals used in energy and manufacturing, vaccines and some metals..

**Canada and Mexico** **are excluded** **from the reciprocal tariff regime.** They are still subject to plans to impose 25% tariffs on most imports to the U.S., though the administration has given an exemption for autos and many other goods. Here‚Äôs a list of the [products and countries exempt](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/what-products-and-which-countries-are-exempted-from-trump-s-tariffs--qN2fmWrIFejrHBSVD8g5) from the tariffs.

**Trump‚Äôs** **25% tariffs** **on foreign-made autos and parts took effect** at 12:01 a.m. ET.

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

üî∏ Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. üü¢

üî∏ Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. üü¢

üî∏ Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‚ÄòLiberation Day‚Äô events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. üü¢

üî∏ Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. üî¥

üî∏ Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn‚Äôt respond well and selling pressure intensified. üî¥

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China‚Äôs response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can‚Äôt afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn‚Äôt make any trades this week. What‚Äôs your prediction for next week?

"2025-04-09 03:40:00";"Here‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think China will cave";"It's kind of the body of evidence the last ~10 years or so.

First we have the Huawei and BYD situation. We (the US) basically locked some of their biggest companies out of the US market and guess what happened. Huawei took a hit but they came roaring back. They went ahead and dominated all the other markets. 

Then we have TikTok. The US has been pressuring China to sell TikTok for almost half a decade now. Not once have they moved an inch on this. We keep saying the sale is close and keep push it back 75 days. Even if a deal eventually gets done, I bet China's (Bytedance) is still going to own a major stake in it.

Then we had the Nvidia chips ban which was a total flop. Don't sell them the best chips. Well they went ahead and made DeepSeek anyway. What we should have done instead is sell them the chips but add a tariff. We basically forced their hand and now they are making their own chips to rival Nvidia. We inadvertently strengthened their semi production capability by imposing this ban.

And let's not forget COVID. Long after the world opened up because of economic, societal pressure ... China held on to their own detriment. They endured excruciating economic pain in the process, they also had the property collapse. This tells me the country has an unusual amount of tolerance for economic carnage.

It kind of reminds me of the Office where Michael Scott is negotiating the sale of his company with David Wallace: ""I don't need to wait out Dunder Mifflin, I just need to wait out you.""

That's because chip industry insiders widely expected the Trump administration to¬†impose curbs on the H20, the most cutting-edge AI chip U.S. companies can legally sell to China, a crucial market to one of the world's most valuable companies.

Following the Mar-a-Lago dinner, the White House reversed course on H20 chips, putting the plan for additional restrictions on hold, according to two sources with knowledge of the plan who were not authorized to speak publicly.

The planned American export controls on the H20 had been in the works for months, according to the two sources, and were ready to be implemented as soon as this week.

The change of course from the White House came after Nvidia promised the Trump administration new U.S. investments in AI data centers, according to one of the sources.

American lawmakers have been pressuring the Trump administration for weeks to place stricter curbs on cutting edge technology related to artificial intelligence. In February, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo.,¬†jointly¬†called¬†for export controls on the H20 chip after Chinese tech company DeepSeek¬†unveiled¬†a breakthrough AI chatbot that stunned the world in January.

The Trump administration's decision to allow Chinese firms to continue to purchase H20 chips is a major victory for the country, said Chris Miller, a Tufts University history professor and semiconductor expert.

""Even though these chips are specifically modified to reduce their performance thus making them legal to sell to China ‚Äî they are better than many, perhaps most, of China's homegrown chips,"" Miller said. ""China still can't produce the volume of chips it needs domestically, so it is critically reliant on imports of Nvidia chips.""

The White House and the Commerce Department did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Nvidia declined to comment.

The Trump administration has reversed course on plans to restrict exports of Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after CEO Jensen Huang attended a Mar-a-Lago dinner last week, NPR reported on Wednesday.

The reversal comes despite months of work on new export controls and mounting national security concerns from both sides of the aisle. Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chip is currently the most advanced AI hardware legally allowed for export to China, and Chinese firms like ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent have reportedly placed around $16 billion in orders just in Q1.

Sources suggest the about-face was tied to Nvidia‚Äôs promise of new AI investments in U.S. data centers - effectively trading access to Chinese markets for domestic tech growth.

For the first time in nearly a century, the S&P 500 saw three consecutive declines of 4 per cent, its worst performance since the end of the Second World War and rivaled by the 1987 Black Monday stock market rout.Losses during this time surpassed damages unleashed by the 2020 Covid pandemic, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers or the losses of 1998, according to a report by El Pais.¬†Though markets were impacted globally, the US stock market bore the biggest brunt, with tech giants referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven""-Apple, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla-- being hit hardest.¬†Per the El Pais report, ""Magnificent Seven"" lost staggering $1.6 trillion since last Thursday, with Apple bearing the biggest brunt and losing over half a trillion dollars, or about 16.8 per cent of its worth during this time. This was mainly because the tariffs directly impacted the company, whose devices are entirely manufactured in Asia.¬†Nvidia reportedly came next, losing $385 billion, followed by Amazon, with $262 billion lost during the rout. Other than that, giants of the traditional US economy like JP Morgan, Eli Lilly, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, and Bank of America also hemorrhaged more than $54 billion in three days, El Pais report said.Impact Beyond USThough US stocks were hardest hit, the other nations also witnessed financial losses. Saudi Arabia's state oil behemoth, Aramco, lost ¬†$138 billion or 8 per cent of its market value in three days. European companies, though smaller in size than American ones, are not left untouched either. Companies like HSBC and Shell (UK), Siemens (Germany), LVMH (France), Total (France), SAP (Germany), Accenture (Ireland), and Novo Nordisk (Denmark) are reportedly on the list of the biggest losers.¬†Asian companies, including China's Alibaba, Japan's Toyota and Mitsubishi, Taiwan's TSMC, which lost &#8364;78 billion in value in just one session (last week was partly a holiday in the country), and South Korea's Samsung lost billions of dollars in three days.Trump Tariff Pause And Market ReboundDays after registering little to no concern for the market bloodbath, US President Trump on Wednesday abruptly paused tariffs on most countries, sparking euphoria on global markets. However, he upped the ante on a brutal trade war with superpower rival China and raised tariffs on Beijing to 125 percent because of a ""lack of respect.""After days of turmoil, stocks on Wall Street and across Asia saw huge surges in reaction to Trump's announcement that he was halting a levy hike for almost all nations for 90 days.Meanwhile, Beijing hit back with retaliatory levies of 84 percent on US imports, which came into effect just after midday on Thursday, the latest salvo in an escalating standoff between the world's two largest economies.Trump has denied that he backtracked on the tariffs, telling reporters that ""you have to be flexible.""He said he had been watching the ""very tricky"" state of the crucial US bonds market before his decision.""I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,"" he said, as US bond yields rose during the stocks sell-off -- a major economic red light as American sovereign government debt is normally seen as a safe haven for investors in troubled times.Trump also predicted that trade deals will be made with all countries, including China, which has for now refused to roll back retaliatory tariffs on US goods.

"2025-04-10 10:00:00";"Meet The Tiny Startup Building Stargate, OpenAI‚Äôs $500 Billion Data Center Moonshot";"Crusoe Energy got its start harnessing oilfield flare gas to mine bitcoin. So how did cofounders Chase Lochmiller and Cully Cavness end up building the first phase of the world‚Äôs biggest AI datacenter ‚Äì $500 billion Project Stargate ‚Äì for OpenAI and Oracle?  It‚Äôs a windy, 80-degree, early March day at the 1,000-acre construction site in Abilene, Texas codenamed Project Ludicrous, where 2,000 workers toil over what will soon be one of the world‚Äôs largest artificial intelligence datacenters. Here under its official name ‚Äî The Stargate Project ‚Äî OpenAI will team with Oracle and Microsoft to create what they claim could be the first generation of AI models to fully surpass human cognition. It will be a ‚Äúfactory of factories,‚Äù says Chase Lochmiller, CEO of lead developer Crusoe Energy. What he means is that AIs trained here will be used to develop more such systems down the line, producing an endless stream of intelligence-as-a-service.  By the end of this year Crusoe expects 100,000 Nvidia graphic processing units (GPUs) to be installed into each of the first two 500,000 square foot ‚ÄúH‚Äù-shaped buildings. Lochmiller, just has to find the right path, both for 8-year-old, $300 million revenue Crusoe, as well as for the Polaris jeep navigating around cranes and trucks on the dusty site. ‚ÄúIt's hard to keep up with the topography of this site. I was here three weeks ago, it didn't look anything like this,‚Äù he says. Crusoe cofounder and COO Cully CavnessCody Pickens for Forbes Each Stargate datacenter building will draw 100 megawatts of electricity, enough for a city of 100,000. Most of that power will come from the hundreds of 300-foot-tall wind turbines spinning in west Texas, which on most days generate far more electricity than the region needs. Windmill owners with a surplus sometimes even sell power into the grid at a loss, making it up by collecting federal green energy tax credits. ‚ÄúNot a great use of those electrons,‚Äù says Lochmiller, 38, who is working to arbitrage that cheap juice for Stargate, which could eventually consume several gigawatts in Abilene. And in case the wind should stop blowing or the Texas grid goes down, Crusoe has set up five gas turbines from General Electric Vernova for backup.  Crusoe raised $3.4 billion in joint venture funding with asset management company Blue Owl Capital and data center-focused investment firm Primary Digital Infrastructure for these first two buildings. But that‚Äôs only a sliver of the $500 billion Oracle founder Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promised in January to invest over the next five years to build the future of AI and secure America‚Äôs global advantage. Sharing a drone shot of the site on X, Altman enthused over the ‚Äúbig, beautiful, buildings.‚Äù That‚Äôs the kind of thing that appeals to President Trump, who in his February speech to Congress lauded the investment, ‚ÄúWhich they wouldn‚Äôt have done if Kamala had won,‚Äù he said.   But why pick relatively unknown Crusoe to build it? Oracle, Microsoft and OpenAI wouldn‚Äôt comment, but it‚Äôs clear, at least to Crusoe‚Äôs investors and partners, that Lochmiller and cofounder Cully Cavness had the drive to build datacenters bigger and faster than they ever had before, and faith that they would find enough energy to power them. A successful outcome is far from assured, and some Crusoe clients are frustrated about what they say is the company‚Äôs less-than-reliable existing cloud computing offerings. Even if this first phase of Stargate, which will eventually comprise 10 buildings, representing 1.2 gigawatts of computing power at a cost of an estimated $15 billion goes off without a hitch, how could Crusoe possibly keep up the momentum and supply chains for AI‚Äôs insatiable appetite for compute and power?Forbes Forbes 2025 AI 50 List The Forbes Artificial Intelligence 50 List of 2025 spotlights promising AI-driven businesses. See the leaders driving the future of the industry.  VIEW THE FULL LIST Another hitch: President Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariffs imposed on some 90 countries last week (now paused), which could make key materials like aluminum and structural steel more expensive and ratchet costs for datacenter developers like Crusoe. The company says it sees it as a competitive moat. ‚ÄúFrom the beginning, Crusoe made the decision to onshore the manufacturing of critical electrical components including switchgear because we believe in building things in America,‚Äù Lochmiller says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a shiny factor with Crusoe,‚Äù says consultant Daniel Golding, who calls them ‚Äúthe flavor of the month.‚Äù After all, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have separately earmarked more than $200 billion for AI infrastructure. Not all will get built, says analyst Zach Krause at East Daley Analytics in Denver. For instance, Microsoft in March announced a slight pullback in datacenter leasing. Krause figures those that do get completed will add some 80 gigawatts of electricity demand nationwide by 2030, an unprecedented 10% growth, or as much as all of Texas uses on a hot summer day. Anyone who remembers Internet 1.0 will recall the vast overbuilding in fiber optic cables and datacenters that evaporated billions when boom turned to bust.  Lochmiller and Cavness, 37, went to high school together in Denver, spending weekends rock climbing. Lochmiller, 6-foot-1 with a shock of black hair, got into AI when he went to Stanford for grad school in 2013. He was struck by Professor Andrew Ng‚Äôs contention that ‚ÄúAI is the new electricity‚Äù soon to be just as widely distributed and relied upon by civilization. AI also consumes massive amounts of power, a truth Lochmiller experienced first hand when running up bills to power the stock forecasting and trading algorithms he built at hedge fund KCG Holdings in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, Cavness had become obsessed with locating the world‚Äôs cheapest, greenest energy sources, visiting 25 countries like Chile and Argentina, even looking at geothermal in Iceland. On a hiking adventure in 2017, the duo decided to join forces to tap ‚Äústranded‚Äù energy sources that would otherwise be wasted to power computing. They named their company after Robinson Crusoe, a fictional 18th century character who was marooned on a Caribbean island and used his resourcefulness to survive. Their first target: redirecting so-called flare gas from oil field operations. Sometimes when new oil wells get drilled, the owners opt to burn off relatively small amounts of natural gas rather than go to the expense of hooking up a pipeline. This wastes energy and produces harmful carbon dioxide. Crusoe‚Äôs big idea was to redirect the natural gas from flares and instead use it to power reciprocating engines to make electricity ‚Äî to mine bitcoin. Early backers were skeptical; Stefan Cohen at Bain Capital led Crusoe‚Äôs $4.5 million seed round in 2019, but initially even he wasn‚Äôt 100% sold: ‚ÄúThe business model itself was not overwhelmingly obvious to us.‚Äù Determined to prove it could be done, Lochmiller put in $600,000 of his own money to build out a shipping container crypto mining rig and set it up in a gas field near Denver. Over time, Crusoe began building compute infrastructure in harsher terrains. Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity Partners, an early backer of Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla, SpaceX and most recently OpenAI rival xAI, first met the team in 2018 when they were installing their first containers in North Dakota‚Äôs Bakken oil field. In the middle of a snowstorm, Gracias flew in to see what they were doing. The weather didn‚Äôt phase Lochmiller, an accomplished mountaineer who had climbed Everest two weeks earlier. Gracias, who almost set himself on fire on one of the heaters, says, ‚ÄúIt was crazy at the time, which is what I loved about it.‚Äù Another early investor, Lee Jacobs of Long Journey, could tell Crusoe had foresight because their original pitch deck, from when the company was focused on bitcoin mining, declared they would forge ‚Äúthe future of compute.‚Äù Jacobs doubled down last December, joining Crusoe‚Äôs $600 million fundraise. ‚ÄúThey always saw what was happening ‚Äî intelligence as a service delivered down a pipe like electricity.‚Äù The company almost came to a standstill in 2020, when lockdowns spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic temporarily dried up demand for gasoline. Oil companies shut down drilling and with it the supply of to-be flared gas that was core to Crusoe‚Äôs business. The company scrambled to find new locations and found a solution in focusing on greener sources of energy. That set up Crusoe for its leap to AI. In 2023, Crusoe borrowed $200 million to purchase coveted Nvidia H100 GPUs to expand its nascent cloud computing services and hired talent from the likes of datacenter giants 365 Main and Digital Realty. They topped off the year by partnering with Iceland‚Äôs AtNorth data center developer to set up their Crusoe Cloud services in the frigid country (making it easier to cool off GPUs). ""Crusoe is building datacenters larger than Digital Realty ever did,"" marvels former CEO Bill Stein, now a Crusoe board member. Key to their longterm success, he says, will be ""signing 15 year leases where counterparty risk is minimal,"" like with Stargate. Crusoe‚Äôs shot at the big time came in the first quarter of 2024. Lochmiller had learned that some tech giants, believed to be OpenAI and Microsoft (he declines to say who) were shopping for contractors to build an AI-specialized, hyperscale datacenter, and do it fast. Other developers balked at the ludicrous timetable of less than two years. Land acquisition, permits, supply chain lead times, all looked impossible. But Lochmiller and Cavness jumped on the RFP. It was less of a pivot, more of an evolution. They already had manufacturing centers in Denver and Tulsa, relationships with important suppliers like G.E. Vernova and new advisors. They were confident Crusoe could build it. As for where, they quickly subleased 1,000 acres in Abilene from developer Lancium, which had already permitted the site and intended to build a crypto mining center. By June 2024, OpenAI and Oracle had announced a partnership where the artificial intelligence giant would use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to integrate AI into Microsoft‚Äôs Azure platform. Jared Sheiker, managing director at datacenter investor Blue Owl Capital ($250 billion assets) was impressed with the ‚Äúaudacity‚Äù of Crusoe. ‚ÄúLocking up a long-term lease with Oracle made this project overnight abundantly attractive to us,‚Äù he says. Blue Owl contributed to Crusoe‚Äôs $600 million 2024 fundraise and helped arrange $2.3 billion in project financing from JPMorgan for the first two buildings and 200 megawatts of compute. All told Crusoe has now raised $1.82 billion in equity and was last valued at $2.8 billion. The datacenter buildings will include four data halls of 25 megawatts of compute each. Factories in Denver and Tulsa will manufacture server racks and install GPUs into skid-mounted units that are trucked to Abilene for installation. It‚Äôs far better to do this in a controlled environment than a dusty, noisy construction site, says Lochmiller; ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want tradesmen stacked on top of each other.‚Äù The GPUs will use liquid cooling. Two-foot diameter water pipes course around the inside of the building; they will continuously recirculate 1 million gallons of chilled water through a network of pipes reaching into the racks of GPUs like capillaries to draw off heat. It‚Äôs a lot of water, but they only have to fill up the system for each building once. By comparison, 1 million gallons is less than what shale gas frackers use to complete a single well. Crusoe and Co. are far from the only ones building facilities like this right now. Others are building bigger and faster. Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI managed to build a massive ‚Äúgigafactory of compute‚Äù in Memphis in just 122 days. Dubbed Colossus, it now has a network of 200,000 GPUs to support its AI supercomputer. Lochmiller says Musk‚Äôs facility is starkly different from what Crusoe is doing: building from the ground up or what‚Äôs known as greenfield development. ‚ÄúThe xAI datacenter, they took an existing building and then retrofitted it to sort of meet the internal electrical needs of the compute racks,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was very creative, but just a very different project than what we've done here.‚Äù Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he‚Äôll invest $65 billion into AI, mostly for datacenters, this year. His biggest is the Sucr√© project in northern Louisiana, a 4 million square feet datacenter with 2 gigawatts of compute expected to cost about $10 billion. Over the longer term, datacenter developers are looking to advances in nuclear power to displace fossil fuels. Amazon has promised $100 billion of AI spending and last year invested $500 million into nuclear startup X-Energy, which aims to build 5 gigawatts of small, modular reactors on datacenter grounds. OpenAI and Softbank are big backers of nuclear fusion developer Helion, which has already presold electricity to Microsoft. The big question: does training AI truly require so much datacenter capacity? The viral launch of Chinese AI darkhorse DeepSeek, which claimed it built cutting edge AI models that rivaled OpenAI‚Äôs top systems at a fraction of the cost and far less compute, has surfaced concerns about the billions of dollars being plunged into AI infrastructure, at a time when companies are yet to reap real ROI. Lochmiller insists more cost-efficient AI training will unlock new use cases. ‚ÄúWhat couldn‚Äôt be improved by adding intelligence?‚Äù he says. He also envisions people will soon pay for intelligence the same way they now do for water or electricity. But is Crusoe ready? Some customers worry Crusoe‚Äôs cloud system is unreliable. In early March one of its centers experienced an outage that lasted 45 hours. One customer, which uses Crusoe Cloud to access GPUs and asked not to be named, was affected by the outage, forcing them to fall back to other cloud providers. ‚ÄúThis was a big deal. We were pretty unhappy about it,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThey're not as reliable.‚Äù An industry expert raised an eyebrow as well.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs less differentiation in Crusoe than they would want you to believe,‚Äù they explained. ‚ÄúBut there's enough demand where anybody that can provide power on site, which is a differentiator.‚Äù Crusoe says its service maintains an uptime of up to 99.98%. And other customers appear to be perfectly happy. ‚ÄúCrusoe is faster than a lot of companies right now,‚Äù says Varun Mohan, CEO of AI coding company Windsurf (formerly Codeium.) Crusoe is able to get its customers access to hardware in a matter of three to four hours, and speed is the need of the hour amid a fierce race to launch more capable AI models. Hyperscalers like AWS and Google Cloud, on the other hand, would take three weeks and bind them in years-long reservations. Nor is Lochmiller immediately concerned about the threat to datacenter demand from new more efficient AI models like China‚Äôs DeepSeek. An AI that uses less ‚Äúcompute‚Äù and therefore less energy to achieve similar results could imply weaker future demand for datacenters. That risks datacenter overbuild, and bust ‚Äî like the bankruptcy-inducing overcapacity in servers and fiberoptic cables at the end of the first Internet boom 25 years ago. Not to worry. After all, Crusoe financed Project Ludicrous on the back of a 15-year contract with Oracle and Microsoft. Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, argued on X this year that AI datacenter growth is immune to normal capital cycles due to something called the Jevons paradox. It‚Äôs named after William Stanley Jevons, the British economist (d. 1882) who determined that lowering the cost of a fuel (coal in his case) will only cause demand for it to rise. ‚ÄúJevons paradox strikes again,‚Äù Nadella wrote in January. ‚ÄúAs AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can‚Äôt get enough of.‚Äù Looking toward Interstate-20 on the southern part of the site and the town of Abilene beyond, Lochmiller marvels at the procession of earth movers hauling tons of north Texas red dirt. They‚Äôre working to flatten what used to be known as Rattlesnake Ridge, where the next set of datacenters will be built. It takes an ironically vast amount of manual labor to accomplish the end goal of the AI revolution, which Lochmiller describes as ‚Äúfreeing up all of that mind space, that creative brain power to focus on higher level abstractions.‚Äù He expects to more than double the number of workers on site to 5,000 at peak next year.

President Donald Trump raised tariffs on China to 125% after China retaliated against Trump's ... More ""Liberation Day"" tariffs.  (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images  Key Facts   Mao Ning, spokesperson for China‚Äôs ministry of foreign affairs, posted a meme on X Thursday morning depicting the cost of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hats spiking by more than 50%, presumably because of Trump‚Äôs tariffs.    The meme depicts the hat with a ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù tag, but official MAGA hats are actually made in the United States, though some unofficial knock-off merchandise may be made in China.    Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the United States, doubled down on Mao‚Äôs meme, posting a meme of MAGA hats spiking in price by more than 100%, which he says was first posted by a user on the Chinese social media app Rednote.    Some AI-generated memes that have circulated on Chinese social media depict Americans working in factories‚Äîin some videos, making Tesla products‚Äîas an apparent nod to Trump‚Äôs desire to reinvigorate American manufacturing through his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs plan.   These memes have gone widely viral on X, with one video of Americans, depicted as overweight, working in a textile factory, which has been viewed nearly 20 million times on X with more than 227,000 likes.   Liu and many other social media users had also posted memes targeting Trump‚Äôs widely mocked tariffs against Heard Island and McDonald Islands, uninhabited territories that were slapped with a 10% tariff, depicting penguins protesting Trump‚Äôs duties on the remote islands.     What‚Äôs Happening With Trump‚Äôs Tariffs In China? China has become Trump‚Äôs biggest tariff target and is exempt from his 90-day pause on tariffs to many nations Trump announced on Wednesday. Trump, instead, raised tariffs on China to 125%, which he says is because of the country‚Äôs retaliatory tariffs imposed on the United States. Trump slammed China‚Äôs ‚Äúlack of respect‚Äù for global markets in a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing increased duties, while criticizing the nation for ‚Äúripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries.‚Äù China had previously retaliated with 84% tariffs on the United States. China‚Äôs commerce ministry spokesperson He Yongqian said Thursday the ‚Äúdoor to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on an equal basis with mutual respect.‚Äù China issued a travel warning to the United States on Wednesday, citing the ‚Äúdeterioration of China-US economic and trade relations.‚Äù Key Background Trump‚Äôs chaotic tariff rollout has roiled global markets and quickly caused some of the stock market‚Äôs worst days in years. Trump touted his tariffs as ‚Äúliberation‚Äù for the United States and announced tariff hikes on nearly every country last week, accusing them of ripping off the United States in global trade. The tariffs sparked international criticism, as well as some bipartisan pushback in the United States, and caused stocks to instantly tank, with economists voicing fears the U.S. would head toward a recession. Various billionaires, including close Trump ally and Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk, have spoken out against the tariffs. Trump announced a 90-day pause on many tariffs Wednesday, bringing down tariffs to a universal 10% rate, prompting stocks to surge.

More Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images Updated, April 10, 2025: This post has been adjusted to reflect the change in U.S. tariffs on China to 145%.  Nvidia stock has fallen 30% from its January 2025 peak of $153, evaporating $1.03 trillion from the company‚Äôs market capitalization, according to Google Finance.   One thing contributing to the drop is the results of the 2024 presidential election which brought Donald Trump back to the Oval Office. Since April 2, his tariff policy has thrown markets into turmoil.  And despite Trump‚Äôs trumpeting of a 90-day pause on most tariffs, Nvidia could be in worse shape. That‚Äôs because tariffs are high on countries where Nvidia products are built. More specifically, Taiwan faced a 34% tariff ‚Äì reduced Wednesday to 10% ‚Äì while China‚Äôs rose to 145% on April 10, according to the Wall Street Journal.   Is the drop in Nvidia‚Äôs stock a buying opportunity? I see no reason to buy now because although orders may have soared in the current quarter in anticipation of tariffs, I expect the company‚Äôs May 2025 earnings report to feature a disappointing growth forecast as a result of tariff uncertainty. More specifically, the uncertainty is due to the difficulty of answering precisely the following questions:  How much will tariffs on Taiwan and China increase Nvidia's costs? Will Nvidia pass those cost increases on to customers? If so, will Nvidia be able to meet its growth targets for the current quarter and the year? If Nvidia decides to hold prices constant, how much will the company's margins decline? In light of economic uncertainty caused by the ongoing tariff tit-for-tat, are companies cutting back on capital expenditures? If so, how much is that reducing demand for Nvidia GPUs?  Nvidia remains bullish. In March, CEO Jensen Huang said tariffs would not cause meaningful short-term harm to the company due to the company‚Äôs agile supply chain; demand for AI would drive demand, and TSMC was building a plant in Arizona, according to Barron‚Äôs.

A spokesperson referred me to a March 2025 company statement from Huang, which said. ‚ÄúTariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we‚Äôre going to have manufacturing onshore.‚Äù Read on for why Nvidia‚Äôs costs could rise significantly, whether Nvidia will pass along those costs to customers, and how the uncertainty around future moves in the global tariff wars may crimp consumer spending and company‚Äôs investments in generative artificial intelligence.  What To Expect From Nvidia‚Äôs Next Earnings Report Nvidia will report quarterly financial results next month featuring slower top-line growth and thinner margins based on the company‚Äôs forecasts when it last reported in February.    First quarter fiscal 2026 revenue: $43 billion ‚Äì plus or minus 2%, according to a company release ‚Äì which is up 65% from the year before and $700 million more than estimates, according to SeekingAlpha. First quarter fiscal 2026 gross margin: 70.6% plus or minus 0.5 percentage points ‚Äì an 8.4 percentage point drop from the year before, according to a company release.  Nvidia expressed enthusiasm about its prospects. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,"" said Huang in a statement. ""AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.‚Äù Analysts were underwhelmed by Nvidia‚Äôs results ‚Äì which lacked ‚Äúthe positive shock value of some of last year‚Äôs reports,‚Äù Sungarden YARP Portfolio Investing Group Leader Rob Isbitts told SeekingAlpha. Nvidia‚Äôs stock is likely to trade ‚Äúmore on raw demand and supply, rather than on some sort of surprise element,‚Äù Isbitts added. ‚ÄúGuidance was slightly underwhelming,‚Äù Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said in a report featured by Bloomberg. ""We think it will be challenging for management to continue to significantly beat expectations for future growth,‚Äù Purk added. How Tariffs Could Affect Nvidia‚Äôs Growth Prospects Tariffs could increase significantly the prices of some Nvidia products. However, it is unclear whether Nvidia will pass all of its increased costs on to customers and whether the higher prices would lower demand. A more significant question for Nvidia‚Äôs future is whether companies will view the high investment in generative AI as being worth the $1 trillion Goldman Sachs estimated. If the technology enables companies to do better work with fewer people, demand for generative AI may remain strong in the event of a recession. How Tariffs Could Raise Nvidia‚Äôs Prices Not all of Nvidia‚Äôs products are vulnerable to being harmed by Trump‚Äôs tariffs. For example, fears of a Trump administration crackdown on Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chip ‚Äì which the company has been exporting to China ‚Äì may not be realized. The reason? ‚ÄúNvidia promised the Trump administration new U.S. investments in AI data centers,‚Äù according to a report from NPR. However, tariffs could raise consumer personal computer prices by as much as 50%, according to WCCFTech. These estimates were made April 3 when the tariff on Chinese goods was a mere 54% ‚Äì a far cry from the 145% tariff imposed on April 10. Tariffs could raise manufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price prices on the following Nvidia gaming machines by at least 50% ‚Äì based on the latest triple-digit tariff:  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 from $1,999 to $2,998.50, according to WCCFTech. Applying the 145% tariff would send the price to $4,897.75. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 from $999 to $1,498.50, WCCFTech noted. The 145% tariff would send the price to $2,447.75.  It remains unclear whether Nvidia will be able to avoid tariffs on GPUs for now. The tariffs could be avoided if actual products are assembled in the U.S., noted Tom‚Äôs Hardware. For now, Nvidia may be able to ship ‚Äúactual GPUs and processors/chipsets to the U.S. without paying import duties along with half-finished logic boards ‚Äì but paying an import tariff -- then assemble actual products in the U.S.,‚Äù reported Tom‚Äôs Hardware. Tariffs Could Lower Demand For AI Generative AI has been in search of a killer app, as I wrote in the Boston Globe. There has been no obvious progress on this goal and the investment required for the technology is enormous ‚Äì potentially totaling $1 trillion. Prior to the tariff announcement, the largest hyperscalers ‚Äì Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft ‚Äì announced plans to spend $270 billion on generative AI data centers in 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal.  However, that spending could take a hit ‚Äì especially for companies like Meta and Google which are dependent on advertising for much of their revenue. If tariffs and the resulting uncertainty cause a recession ‚Äì due to rising prices and fear of declining demand and higher unemployment ‚Äì companies could decide to cut back on their generative AI spending. The reason for cutting back would be a simple realization that the return on investment in generative AI is not yet compelling. Amazon‚Äôs cloud-computing arm historically has generated $4 of incremental revenue for every $1 of capital spending, TD Cowen John Blackledge tech analyst told the Journal. Generative AI‚Äôs ratio ‚Äúis currently something like 20 cents for every dollar,‚Äù Blackledge added. Microsoft, which plans to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in the current fiscal year, is slowing construction ‚Äì including a $1 billion project in Ohio. Microsoft canceled leases in the U.S. and Europe -- partly due to an oversupply of data-center space relative to the company‚Äôs demand forecast, noted TD Cowen analysts. However, ‚Äúthe moves signal a more cautious stance in the longer term,‚Äù the Journal reported. All that could be painful for Nvidia investors ‚Äì unless surviving with fewer people during a long period of stagflation becomes the killer app for generative AI.

"2025-04-10 21:19:00";"Retail investors are running head first into this topsy-turvy market";" / Source: CNBCBy Alex Harring, CNBCWhile Wall Street spent the past week sweating over whether President Donald Trump‚Äôs¬†now-altered tariff plan¬†would push the economy into a recession or ignite a bear market, Rachel Hazit knew exactly what to do.The Philadelphia-based marketer used cash she had on the sidelines to buy equities like the¬†Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)¬†and the¬†Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQM)¬†last week. After learning about investing last year, the 32-year-old felt like she was seeing her first big drop in the market as someone with skin in the game.‚ÄúI see this time now as an opportunity,‚Äù Hazit said in an interview with CNBC this week. When the market declined last week, she remembers thinking: ‚ÄúThis is on sale.‚ÄùHazit‚Äôs investments are part of a flood of money totaling billions of dollars from everyday investors who have entered the stock market in recent days. These retail traders appear to following the conventional market wisdom of ‚Äúbuying the dip,‚Äù which refers to a strategy of purchasing stocks when they decline because they‚Äôre considered discounted.Trump‚Äôs¬†April 2¬†announcement of broad and steep tariffs sent the stock market reeling as investors feared the taxes on imports would hamstring consumer spending and drive up inflation. Several Wall Street strategists¬†cut their outlooks¬†for the¬†S&P 500, a benchmark index of the largest public companies in the U.S., while multiple economists for these firms¬†hiked¬†the likelihood for a recession.That all came to a head exactly one week later: Trump on Wednesday¬†rolled back¬†most of his planned levies, citing investor fears as one driver of the decision. An afternoon rally following the news pushed the S&P 500 up more than 9% in the session, marking its best day since 2008.Institutional investors ran for the hills during that week, causing the S&P 500 to briefly dip into bear market territory, which refers to a 20% drop from recent highs. But data from market insights firm Vanda Research, a trusted authority on retail investor trends, showed mom-and-pop traders like Hazit doing the exact opposite.‚ÄúWhat marks an equity drawdown? It‚Äôs usually retail capitulation as the final shoe to drop,‚Äù said Marco Iachini, vice president of research at Vanda. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre clearly not seeing that.‚ÄùConsider that on April 3, while the S&P 500 cratered nearly 5% in the wake of Trump‚Äôs initial announcement, self-directed retail investors pushed more than $3 billion into U.S. stocks on balance. That‚Äôs the largest daily net haul on record, per Vanda data going back to 2014.Small investors continued to buy stocks on balance over the following three days as the market tanked. In total, retail traders sent around $8.8 billion in net inflows to the U.S. stock market between last Thursday and this Tuesday, per Vanda.Those purchases took place during an especially rocky stretch for the market. In the period between the April 2 close and the end of trading on April 8, the¬†Dow Jones Industrial Average¬†lost more than 4,500 points and the S&P 500 tumbled 12%.Similarly, JPMorgan found retail traders bought around $11 billion in equities over the past week ended Wednesday. That‚Äôs about 2.5 times higher than the average seen over the past year, the firm said.What retail investors wantSome trading during this period appeared tied to speculation on if Trump would roll back the levies he slapped on foreign countries, Vanda‚Äôs Iachini said. But Vanda has also seen strong inflows into exchange-traded funds tracking the broader market like Vanguard‚Äôs VOO and State Street‚Äôs¬†SPY.Purchasing these diversified indexes can signal individual investors are looking to buy into the market and hold onto their positions for a longer-term period, Iachini said. That‚Äôs a strategy retail trading experts favor over stock picking and day trading.This drive into broad market funds reflects the sentiment among the retail crowd that ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù is a successful strategy, Iachini said. The logic, he said, goes something like this: If it‚Äôs mostly worked and produced great returns over the last 15 years, why stop now?To be sure, these investors are raising their exposure to an increasingly risky market. The¬†CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street‚Äôs ‚Äúfear gauge‚Äù known in short as the VIX, closed at levels this week not seen since early 2020. The Dow, a blue-chip index closely followed by everyday traders, saw¬†its largest intraday point swing¬†in its history on Monday.Retail investors have stood firm despite the turbulence. Mark Malek, investing chief at Siebert Financial, said his firm‚Äôs team that handles retail traders saw strong demand to buy on Wednesday, even as Trump‚Äôs announcement of pared-back import taxes¬†catapulted¬†the market higher.Malek said there‚Äôs been significant interest in megacap technology names. In this vein, JPMorgan said¬†Nvidia¬†received about 6 of every 7 retail dollars sent into individual stocks on balance between April 2 and April 9.Investing-focused influencers have tried to spread the word about the buying opportunity and dissuade panic-selling during the recent market decline. Tori Dunlap, who runs a platform focused on teaching women and minorities how to build wealth through investing,¬†reminded followers¬†that ‚Äúmillionaires are made during market downturns.‚ÄùBut there‚Äôs also some key reasons for retail to sit out at this moment. One retail investor told CNBC that while he would have liked to buy the dip, he needed to save his cash on hand to pay the IRS by the April 15¬†federal tax filing deadline.'Along for the ride'While Hazit has been sending cash into the market when it slides, she¬†isn‚Äôt happy¬†with the overall economic outlook. For example, she‚Äôs concerned about how Trump‚Äôs tariff policy could affect her spending power when she wants to buy a new phone in the future.‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something that I‚Äôm out here celebrating. I‚Äôm quietly just buying one stock at a time when I can,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely not a good time. It‚Äôs scary.‚ÄùEven as¬†consumer confidence declines¬†and¬†recession fears swirl, this cohort of market participants knows that recent days have provided a good time to deploy cash into stocks.Namaan Mian moved up his timeline to make his annual investments, knowing the decline in recent days provided an entry point. He bought shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF on Tuesday, which aligns with his strategy of focusing on broad market indexes.The 33-year-old said he wasn‚Äôt thinking about the potential for an economic downturn or what would ultimately happen with Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Because Mian looks longer term and has been investing since his teen years, he‚Äôs learned to detach emotion and always plans to keep holdings for at least several years. With this mindset, he said it can even become ‚Äúfun‚Äù to watch the market gyrate.‚ÄúIf I was 65 years old, I‚Äôm giving you a different answer,‚Äù Mian, the operations chief at a consultant training firm, told CNBC. ‚ÄúBut because I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm kind of just along for the ride.‚Äù‚Äî CNBC‚Äôs Sarah Min contributed to this report.More from CNBC:How the mother of all ‚Äòshort squeezes‚Äô helped drive stocks to historic gains Wednesday Freight surges on tariff reversal: Trade whipsaws from ‚Äòsuper cautious‚Äô to ‚Äòships are filling up‚Äô See if you qualify for the $1,400 IRS stimulus check before the deadline Alex Harring, CNBC";"News";"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/retail-investors-are-running-head-first-topsy-turvy-market-rcna200754"
"2025-04-11 00:36:00";"I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months. I finally sold.";"First off, I would like to preface this with saying my condolences to those who have incurred any losses lately. It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.

As many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent ""Yen Carry Trade"" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.

Last year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.

\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.

\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.

\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work. This article was one example:  
[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555)

\- Suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy: In 2024, we reached one of the highest rate in the decade [https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades)

\- Trump winning the presidential election: I was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign, and I knew that if he actually did implement these, it would shock the market. It was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not, which he did.

With all these reasonings in mind, I had a 90% confidence that the market would crash soon, so I YOLO'd my whole portfolio into UVIX after election.

https://preview.redd.it/ovma6m9vj3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd719e0b6d0ff7892d07461aa3eae2312d52caea

Holding this ticker was mentally tough, the market kept rallying from 580 to 620 post-election, and my position was decaying and I was holding a -200k loss for the vast majority of the time. Many people discouraged my position, and some think I should cut my losses. I even isolated myself for a while because I was so sure of my bet. There were two moments when I could have sold to break even: Federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and Trump's initial Canada/Mexico tariffs. But UVIX didn't rise as much as I anticipated, so I kept holding.

https://preview.redd.it/e5e6xfsxj3ue1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f45917088fa769ca5123420f1fec427851fbb2f

Fast forward to last week, Trump announced a severe blanket tariff, which crashed the market as we know it. This was finally the moment I've been waiting for as UVIX went from $20 to $100 in the span of 4 days. I kept my eyes on the news, set my alarm to 6 am to watch the market open. UVIX could rapidly drop/rise in matter of seconds, and I did not want to sell too early/late, so I was shedding 1k shares a day to be safe. 1k at 70, 1k at 90, 2k at 100 on Tuesday. At this point, I had 3k remaining, and I was hoping that UVIX would maybe rise to 140, but then Trump sent out the tweet that he's basically cancelling the tariffs, which shot the market back up, and plummeted UVIX to 40, luckily I was able to salvage and sell at 56 on the way down. It wasn't quite the finish I was hoping for, but overall, I did get to gain roughly 250k off of my 400k bet.

https://preview.redd.it/k4bzie1sk3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=f788c3fce00964a3a5e9f9202b6db85d3f5bda4a

Now that I've been able to cash out on the big -20% SPY crash I've anticipated, I am completely out of UVIX for now. Even if the market continues to fall, I have full confidence that we'll eventually recover back to our previous 620 ATH, so I'll be DCAing into SPXL/TQQQ from this point on until we reach that price.

https://preview.redd.it/8j48yvnul3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68d62402c4fdc3ec905d7c036fcd3cee5ff37f1

In the end, I would not encourage anyone else to do what I did. Even with my conviction and accurate market reading, I had to hold UVIX for 6 months, which ended up being one of the most stressful thing I could do. I've lost sleep, became disillusioned with the economy/government, and absorbed more bad news than I could handle. I've internally cheered for bearish news, despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people.

I was somewhat lucky that Trump did indeed enact his tariffs, otherwise I may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted.

In the end, I'm just relieved that I could finally exit my large UVIX positions, and I will never all-in again the way I did. I hoped you all enjoyed my perspective/story and I wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market.";"Reddit";"https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i_allind_and_held_400k_in_uvix_for_6_months_i/"

More for the app for Chinese AI company DeepSeek alongside the logo for the ChatGPT app on January 29, 2025 in Bath, England.  (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)Getty Images Trefis  Question: Why would someone pay 30 times earnings for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) when Nvidia stock is available at 33 times earnings? It may not seem logical, especially when considering these three key factors:   Growth: Nvidia‚Äôs revenue has been expanding at a significantly higher pace‚Äîover 80% annually over the past three years‚Äîwhile Microsoft has reported growth of approximately 12%. Margins: Nvidia maintains profit margins above 60%, allowing more of its revenue growth to convert into profits. Microsoft‚Äôs operating margins remain solid at 45% but still trail Nvidia‚Äôs. Tariffs: Microsoft‚Äôs expansive cloud services and large enterprise customer base could offer some insulation from the adverse effects of tariffs. Nvidia, on the other hand, currently enjoys a semiconductor exemption from tariffs. Moreover, leading tech firms such as Amazon, Google, and Meta are expected to sustain their investments in AI infrastructure despite current macroeconomic conditions.  Is Nvidia A Safe Bet? Although Nvidia may appear to be a ‚Äúsafe haven,‚Äù its historical performance during market disruptions suggests caution. During the 2022 inflation shock, NVDA plunged over 65%. In 2020, amid pandemic-driven uncertainty, the stock declined more than 35%. Most notably, it lost 85% of its value during the 2008‚Äì2009 financial crisis. So, NVDA doesn‚Äôt exactly qualify as a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers detailed insights into how Nvidia has performed during and after past market crashes.   Still, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has already corrected meaningfully, dropping from nearly $150 earlier this year to under $110 currently. Investors seeking a potentially more resilient alternative may want to explore the Trefis High Quality portfolio, a strategy that has returned more than 91% since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics.  Nvidia‚Äôs AI Dominance For investors who believe in the long-term growth of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be a compelling choice at its current valuation. The company holds a crucial position as an ‚Äúarms supplier‚Äù in the AI revolution. Investing in Nvidia is effectively backing the infrastructure that powers AI development across major companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon.   As the AI boom is still in its early phases, companies continue to invest heavily in supporting infrastructure. For instance, Meta‚Äôs projected capital expenditures for tech infrastructure stand at around $65 billion‚Äîillustrating the magnitude of ongoing AI investments.

Earnings may fall short of projections, and growth could decelerate from the current 50% rate to a more modest 30%, especially if firms begin conserving cash.  There‚Äôs also a possibility that Nvidia‚Äôs clients will prioritize building more efficient AI models, reducing their need for an ever-expanding volume of chips. Moreover, unexpected developments can adversely affect the stock. Investors should be aware of the potential for a 40% drop in share price under adverse conditions. However, selling amid such a downturn could undermine long-term investment goals.   Long-Term Perspective Preserve & Grow Wealth with Risk-Focused Quality Portfolios Despite these headwinds, long-term investors with a 3‚Äì5 year horizon who are comfortable with market volatility may find Nvidia attractive at current levels. For those interested in strategies designed to navigate downturns, the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio has consistently outperformed a blended benchmark of all-cap stocks, including the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Alternatively, investors could consider consulting with an advisor experienced in bear market strategies. Staying calm and strategic during turbulent markets can lead to significant long-term gains.

"2025-04-11 12:01:00";"Forbes Daily: China Hikes Tariffs On U.S. As Trade War Heats Up";"Relief on interest rates could still be coming, even as President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are expected to make inflation worse. But one key Federal Reserve official says there‚Äôs no ‚Äúgeneric playbook‚Äù for the current situation.  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee told reporters that Trump‚Äôs 10% global tariff will cause inflation to ‚Äúmaterially increase,‚Äù but said he still believes the Fed will lower rates in the next 12 to 18 months. The target federal funds rate remains at 4.25% to 4.5%, higher than it‚Äôs been in recent history as the central bank aims to combat inflation.   But markets are still flailing, as stocks pared down Wednesday‚Äôs gain on Thursday. And the White House confirmed tariffs on China are actually even higher than previously announced, with a rate of 145% for many goods.  FIRST UPAnadolu via Getty Images China raised its tariffs on all U.S. imports to 125% on Friday in retaliation against the Trump administration‚Äôs latest escalation of its trade war with the country, though Chinese officials indicated they do not plan to respond to any further increases in the tariff rate by the U.S. Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly commented on the worsening trade conflict for the first time, urging the European Union to side with it in pushing back against Washington.  A sightseeing helicopter crashed in the Hudson River in New York City on Thursday, killing all six people onboard‚Äîthe latest in a series of aviation disasters and near misses in the past few months. Earlier in the day, two American Airlines planes clipped wings while on the runway at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and though no one was injured, it was the latest alarming incident at the airport.  This is a published version of the Forbes Daily newsletter, you can sign-up to get Forbes Daily in your inbox here. BUSINESS + FINANCE  There was good news on the inflation front last month, as consumer prices increased less than expected year-over-year in March, though the 2.4% rate remained above the Fed‚Äôs target. Still, the numbers don‚Äôt reflect any impacts on prices from increased tariff rates, and even with the 90-day pause on many levies, the effective tariff rate will still increase by 15 percentage points, Goldman Sachs economists estimated Wednesday. TECH + INNOVATIONAFP via Getty Images Amid the recent political controversy surrounding Tesla, the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs sales of its Cybertruck fell sharply in the first quarter of the year. According to Cox Automotive, the company delivered just 6,406 Cybertrucks this year through March, less than half of what it delivered in the third and fourth quarters of last year. MONEY + POLITICS U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA)  and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD)Getty Images The House passed a budget plan Thursday after the vote was delayed earlier in the week as some Republicans wanted steeper cuts in spending. It‚Äôs the first step in executing President Donald Trump‚Äôs signature policy priorities, but Democrats have warned that Congress would have to slash entitlement spending to pay for the proposed tax cuts. Members of Congress traded as much as $1.27 million worth of Tesla stock after Elon Musk endorsed Trump, the latest in a slew of conflict-of-interest concerns as Musk plays a key role in the administration. At least nine House members and one senator bought or sold Tesla shares after July 13, the day the world‚Äôs richest man endorsed Trump, and they represent both parties. TRENDS + EXPLAINERS As more Americans turn to side hustles in the face of rising costs, social media is flooded with videos that promise ‚Äúeasy‚Äù paths to wealth. But many of the creators behind such videos are earning income from teaching others, reselling popular courses that promise to teach the foundations of building an online business. President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs led to market panic, but are they legal? Conservative lawyers argue Trump is exceeding his authority by enacting tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives presidents power to take major economic steps and impose sanctions during national emergencies. But it does not say anything explicitly about tariffs. DAILY COVER STORY Meet The Tiny Startup Building Stargate, OpenAI‚Äôs $500 Billion Data Center MoonshotCrusoe cofounder and CEO Chase LochmillerCody Pickens for Forbes  Through the Stargate Project, soon to be one of the world‚Äôs largest artificial intelligence datacenters, OpenAI will team with Oracle and Microsoft to create what they claim could be the first generation of AI models to fully surpass human cognition. Each Stargate datacenter building will draw 100 megawatts of electricity, enough for a city of 100,000. Most of that power will come from the hundreds of 300-foot-tall wind turbines spinning in west Texas, which on most days generate far more electricity than the region needs. Lead developer Crusoe Energy raised $3.4 billion in joint venture funding with asset management company Blue Owl Capital and data center-focused investment firm Primary Digital Infrastructure for these first two buildings. But that‚Äôs only a sliver of the $500 billion Oracle founder Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promised in January to invest over the next five years to build the future of AI and secure America‚Äôs global advantage. But why pick relatively unknown Crusoe to build it? Oracle, Microsoft and OpenAI wouldn‚Äôt comment, but it‚Äôs clear, at least to the startup‚Äôs investors and partners, that Crusoe CEO Chase Lochmiller and cofounder Cully Cavness had the drive to build datacenters bigger and faster than they ever had before, and faith that they would find enough energy to power them. A successful outcome is far from assured, and some Crusoe clients are frustrated about what they say is the company‚Äôs less-than-reliable existing cloud computing offerings. Even if this first phase of Stargate‚Äîwhich will eventually comprise 10 buildings, representing 1.2 gigawatts of computing power at a cost of an estimated $15 billion‚Äîgoes off without a hitch, how could Crusoe possibly keep up the momentum and supply chains for AI‚Äôs insatiable appetite for compute and power? WHY IT MATTERS ‚ÄúAI companies that were once constrained by the supply of advanced Nvidia chips face a new roadblock: power,‚Äù say Forbes reporter Rashi Shrivastava and senior editor Chris Helman. ‚ÄúSystems like ChatGPT consume tons of electricity, enough for tens of thousands of homes. That has translated into more opportunity for Crusoe, the $2.8 billion-valued company with a knack for finding untapped energy sources in remote places like North Dakota and Iceland and building datacenters to power compute-heavy tasks, starting with cryptocurrency mining and now running and training AI models.‚Äù MORE Forbes 2025 AI 50 List FACTS + COMMENTS Elon Musk backed down from his latest claim that DOGE would find $1 trillion in savings before his tenure at the agency was up.

"2025-04-11 17:43:00";"SMTC DEADLINE ALERT: Semtech Corporation (SMTC) Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact Hagens Berman¬†Before Apr. 22nd Deadline in Securities Class Action";" SAN FRANCISCO, April  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ: SMTC) is navigating a turbulent period, facing a securities class-action lawsuit alleging investor deception regarding its CopperEdge product line. Recent comments from the company‚Äôs CEO during the Q4 2025 earnings call have brought the company's close relationships with key customers into sharper focus, raising questions about prior awareness of product-related challenges. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased Semtech securities and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Aug. 27, 2024 ‚Äì Feb. 7, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Apr. 22, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/smtc Contact the Firm Now: SMTC@hbsslaw.com ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†844-916-0895 Semtech‚Äôs Customer Relationships at Center of CopperEdge Delayed Ramp: The lawsuit, Kleovoulos v. Semtech Corporation, et al., centers on claims that Semtech misled investors about the readiness and projected ramp-up of CopperEdge, a critical component for advanced data center interconnects. During the March 13, 2025, earnings call, CEO Hong Hou acknowledged delays, stating, ""We are disappointed that the expected volume ramp would not materialize for FY ‚Äô26 due to rack architecture changes as we previously announced.‚Äù Crucially, CEO Hou also highlighted the company's extensive collaboration with potential and ""anchor"" customers. ‚ÄúWe remain engaged with over 20 potential customers, including hyperscalers, switch makers and the cable suppliers,‚Äù Hou stated. ""Lastly, based on continued collaboration with our anchor customer [reportedly Nvidia], we expect our CopperEdge portfolio to be included in their future generation rack designs."" The Pending Semtech Securities Class Action CEO Hou‚Äôs acknowledgement of close collaboration, specifically regarding ""rack designs,"" has drawn attention in light of the lawsuit's claims that Semtech failed to disclose necessary rack architecture changes. The suit, filed in the Central District of California, claims the company overstated the product's market readiness and projected ramp-up timeline. The complaint alleges claims on behalf of investors who purchased Semtech securities between August 27, 2024, and February 7, 2025. During this period, Semtech allegedly promoted its CopperEdge portfolio, designed for 400G and 800G data center applications using copper cable and backplane interconnects, asserting it provided ""valuable solutions"" to meet customer demands. The complaint alleges Semtech made ""false and misleading statements"" by failing to disclose key information. Specifically, the suit contends the CopperEdge products did not meet the needs of a key server rack customer, required significant rack architecture modifications, and would not achieve the previously forecast fiscal 2026 ramp-up. The revelation of these issues on February 7, 2025, triggered a sharp market reaction. Semtech disclosed that CopperEdge sales would not ""ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026"" due to ""feedback from a server rack customer,"" ""discussions with end users,"" and the need for ""certain rack architecture changes."" The company further revised its sales projections, indicating CopperEdge revenue would fall below the previously stated $50 million floor. The market‚Äôs response was immediate and severe.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences interest rates on all kinds of consumer loans, rose as high as 4.59% on Friday before retreating slightly. The yield recently stood at 4.5%, 6 basis points above yesterday's close. Treasury yieldssoared this week even as tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, battering the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown. The 10-year yield has skyrocketed more than 50 basis points‚Äîor half a percentage point‚Äîin the last five days, its largest weekly increase since 2008. The bond sell-off‚Äîbond yields and prices are inversely related, meaning yields rise when prices fall‚Äîhas defied standard market logic. Bond prices usually increase when stocks fall as investors pivot to the relative safety of U.S. Treasurys. Bond prices also tend to increase as therisk of recessiongrows more acute; investors, expecting theFederal Reserveto cut interest rates in response to a slowdown, purchase Treasurys to lock in today's comparatively high rates. Experts have pointed toa few possible culpritsfor the bond market's recent volatility. Some point to the potential for Trump's tariffs to nudge inflation higher, which could force the Fed to keep interest rates elevated. Others have speculated that Trump's antagonistic trade and foreign policy has reduced global demand for Treasurys, the world's most widely held sovereign debt. China is one of the largest holders of U.S. debt, and some experts warn it could wreak havoc on the Treasury market by dumping bonds.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/treasury-yields-are-soaring-like-it-is-2008-and-experts-arent-sure-why-11713680"

Stock volatility jumped last week when President Trump announced sweeping tariffs that would raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest level in more than a century. TheCboe Volatility Index(VIX), sometimes referred to as the fear index, nearly tripled between Trump‚Äôs tariff announcement last Wednesday andMonday morningwhen stocks opened at their lowest level in more than a year. The VIXhas remained elevateddespitea historic stock rallyon Wednesday when Trump delayed nearly all of the tariffs. The index traded above 40, a level it hit only once in all of 2023 and 2024, for a sixth consecutive day on Friday. The stock market‚Äôs volatility matches the unpredictability of the White House‚Äôs trade policy. Trump has announced, delayed, escalated, and watered down his tariff threats repeatedly during the first months of his presidency, putting businesses and consumers on tenterhooks. Mentions of ‚Äúchaos‚Äù on earnings calls and at corporate conferences haveskyrocketed in recent weeks, according to analysis from data provider AlphaSense. The 90-day pause eliminates some of the risk hanging over markets, according to Kristian Kerr, Head of Macro Strategy at LPL Financial, who noted countries and companies could negotiate lower rates over the next three months. ‚ÄúSo in essence uncertainty has been reduced a bit,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut the erratic nature of US policy will remain an overhang and keep uncertainty elevated versus norms until we get more definitive clarity on trade policy.‚Äù Wall Street expects more twists and turns in the coming months. The 90-day pause ‚Äúmay provide companies with a clearer backdrop for their guidance, offering some relief to a market hungry for direction,‚Äù wrote Gina Bolvin, President of Bolvin Wealth Management in a note on Wednesday. ‚ÄúHowever, uncertainty looms over what happens after the 90-day period, leaving investors to grapple with potential volatility ahead.‚Äù Kerr and Bolvin both recommend investors take the long view. Trading volume hit a record high last Friday and again on Monday, evidence that ‚Äúemotional selling had firmly taken over,‚Äù according to Kerr. ‚ÄúWhen valuations overshoot to irrational extremes, opportunities emerge for investors willing to think long-term,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDislocations like this can present chances to buy solid assets at prices that reflect panic rather than reality.‚Äù ‚ÄúI empathize with those who sold out yesterday and are now watching the rebound from the sidelines,‚Äù Bolvin wrote on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThis underscores the importance of staying fully invested, particularly in a market as reactive and headline-driven as this one.‚Äù";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-tariffs-stock-market-volatility-buying-opportunity-11713537"
"2025-04-11 20:01:00";"Will Inflation-Weary Consumers Make The Fed‚Äôs Job Harder?";"The ups and downs of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff policies have consumers feeling down and out, a closely followed survey showed Friday. Consumer sentiment fell for the fourth straight month in April, dropping 11%from March, according to theMichigan Consumer Sentiment Index.The reading of 50.8 was well under the 54.6 expected by economists surveyed byDow Jones NewswiresandThe Wall Street Journal,as a wide swath of the U.S. public raised worries about the state of the economy. ‚ÄúConsumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,‚Äù said Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan‚Äôs Survey of Consumers. And that could be bad news for Federal Reserve policymakers, who look at consumer expectations to give them an idea of what's to come. Worries of a growing trade war were the source of the anxiety, Hsu said, coming as President Donald Trump has initiated a number of new tariffs on foreign trading partners, some of which werelater paused. The proposals have generated various responses, fromroller-coaster movementsin the stock market toretaliatory tariffs from Chinaand other trading partners. The report showed that it‚Äôs causing anxiety for nearly everyone. ‚ÄúThis decline was, like the last month‚Äôs, pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation,‚Äù Hsu said. Consumers‚Äô primary worry about tariffs seems to be inflation, as year-ahead expectations for price increases jumped to 6.7%, almost two percentage points higher than last month. This is the worst consumers have felt about inflation since 1981. The increasing consumer inflation expectations defy past historical trends, where people generally became more worried about higher prices as inflation rates rose, noted Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein. However, recent inflation readings show thatprice increases are slowing, including declines in consumer andwholesale inflation ratesthis week. ‚ÄúConsumers are growing increasingly concerned about the coming price environment given how widely tariffs are reaching,‚Äù the Wells Fargo note said. ‚ÄúEven as inflation has moderated over the past year, consumers are more price sensitive today, leaving less cushion for them to take price hikes.‚Äù Elevated inflation worries could be a problem for the Federal Reserve. Officials follow consumers‚Äô feelings about inflation because those inflationexpectations can become self-fulfilling. While tariffs are expected to cause prices to jump for some items, the one-time event could have a limited effect since inflation measures price increases compared to similar points in time, usually looking at the prior month and the past year. ‚ÄúMonetary policymakers may look through a temporary pop in price growth when it comes to setting policy if it feels confident that longer-term inflation expectations are ‚Äòanchored,‚Äô‚Äù the Wells Fargo note said. The inflation expectations are poorly anchored when ""the public reacts to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation by marking up their long-run expectation considerably,"" according to former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke. These decades-high inflation expectations could be a problem, economists said. ""We may not have seen price pressures in the official data in March, but the Fed will have to deal with containing or putting a lid on inflation expectations while, at the same time, dealing with slower growth and, perhaps, potential challenges to their independence,"" wrote BMO Senior Economist Jennifer Lee.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/will-inflation-weary-consumers-make-the-fed-s-job-harder-11713725"
"2025-04-11 20:08:00";"Would You Pass Warren Buffett's Hamburger Quiz?";"In a letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) shareholders, legendary investorWarren Buffettonce posed a deceptively simple question: ""If you plan to eat hamburgers throughout your life (and are not a cattle producer), should you wish for higher or lower prices for beef?""The answer is lower, of course. Yet, according to Buffett, this question cuts to the heart of how investors should also think about markets and investing. The ""hamburger quiz"" illustrates Buffett's gift for making complex financial concepts accessible through everyday analogies. His point was clear: just as consumers should prefer lower prices for items they buy regularly, long-term investors should try to see market declines as opportunities, not disasters. We discuss why below‚Äîand it's not about timing the market. Buffett's analogy connects our understanding of consumer behavior to counterintuitivemarket psychology. We instantly recognize that lower beef prices benefit hamburger consumers. Yet when stock prices fall, most investors tend to panic rather than scope out the bargains. He continues with another metaphor: ""Likewise, if you are going to buy a car from time to time but are not an auto manufacturer, should you prefer higher or lower car prices? These questions, of course, answer themselves."" However, Buffett says many investors have the wrong answer when faced with their own version of the hamburger test. ""Even though they are going to be net buyers of stocks for many years to come, they are elated when stock prices rise and depressed when they fall. In effect, they rejoice because prices have risen for the 'hamburgers' they will soon be buying."" Many investors regularly check theirportfolio, feeling better or worse as markets rise and fall. Fighting this natural response demands both intellectual understanding of Buffett's principles and emotional resilience. There are, of course, fundamental differences betweenconsumingandinvesting, with each having entirely different purposes and the means for doing so. Consumption goods like hamburgers provide immediateutilitybut no future return. Their value is realized through use, with nothing left over. Even a car, which can last for many years, steadily loses value and eventually becomes worthless, except maybe for someresidual scrap value. Meanwhile, investing sacrifices the ability to consume today since you're putting that money into a portfolio to generate future returns. The purpose, then, is to create more wealth over time. In short, consumption is about the present; investing is about the future. When you buy a hamburger, your concern ends with a full stomach. But with investments, timing matters tremendously. Market declines only benefit you if prices eventually recover during yourinvestment horizon. Retirees or those short on cash might need to sell off their investments to pay the bills. Thus, when the market declines, that's a real problem, not an opportunity. While Buffett's hamburger principle highlights the opportunity in market downturns, it doesn't mean you should try to time the market. Instead, you can use strategies likedollar-cost averaging‚Äîinvesting fixed amounts regularly no matter the market conditions‚Äîto naturally capitalize on price dips. The hamburger analogy does help focus attention on the psychological reality of watching markets decline. Even long-term investors can struggle to maintain perspective when their portfolio values plummet. Buffett's message thus directly challenges how most people instinctively respond to downturns. ""Smile when you read a headline that says 'Investors lose as market falls,'"" he told Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders. ""Edit it in your mind to 'Disinvestors lose as market falls‚Äîbut investors gain.'"" The hamburger quiz teaches people to treat market downturns as buying opportunities. The challenge it highlights grows more difficult when market declines persist for extended periods. While Buffett's hamburger principle remains insightful, the emotional toll of multiyear bear markets tests even disciplined investors' resolve.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/warren-buffett-s-hamburger-quiz-11712560"

Several Fed officials said they expect consumer prices to rise and economic growth to slow, worsening the outlook for both sides of the Fed's ""dual mandate"" to keep inflation low and employment high.Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, spoke withYahoo! FinanceFriday. She said she expects inflation of ""well over 3%"" this year. That would be a setback, considering the Fed's goal is to get inflation to a 2% annual rate, as measured by core Personal Consumption Expenditures.

Speaking at a bankers' convention in Arkansas on Friday, Musalem said he was skeptical of the ""textbook"" view that the Fed should ignore tariff-driven price increases because they are, in theory, one-time events.Musalem acknowledged high inflation and a slower economy would put the Fed in a ""challenging"" position.The Federal Reserve's main tool to fight inflation and keep the labor market afloat is changing thefederal funds rate, which influences borrowing costs on all kinds of loans. The Fed can lower the rate to boost the economy with easy money, preventing unemployment. Or, it can raise the rate to reduce borrowing and inflation by allowing supply and demand to rebalance. But it can't do both at the same time. The Fed has kept its rate high in recent months to smother out the last embers of the post-pandemic surge of inflation, which has come down considerably since 2022 but is still more than the Fed's 2% annual target.Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, said the tariffs were likely to cause inflation and economic stagnation at the same time, an economic condition known as ""stagflation.""""Prices are going up while jobs are being lost and growth is coming down,"" Goolsbee said at the Economic Club of New York Thursday.""There is not a generic playbook for how the central bank should respond to a stagflationary shock.""Jeff Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he would prioritize fighting inflation if the Fed were forced to choose between keeping price increases in check and preserving the labor market.""There is a growing possibility that in setting policy, the Fed will have to balance inflation risks against growth and employment concerns,"" Schmid said in a speech to business leaders in Kansas City on Thursday.

Luckily, cash havens are offering great returns these days. Here are some top rates today: We track returns on all these options every week, letting you choose which ones make the most sense for your money now. The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Giventhe stock market rollercoaster unleashedby President Trump's announcement last week of globe-spanning tariffs, building a solid cash reserve seems increasingly wise. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or shifting funds from stocks into cash vehicles, it's important you consider how much you can earn from different strategies. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds or timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, as well as indicate the change from a week ago. Need to better understand the pros and cons of these different savings vehicles? Below the tables, we describe each one and provide links to more detailed information. This week saw improved rates for several cash instruments, which you can see noted below. The highest yield across categories is the 20-year Treasury bond, which is up to 4.91% today, while 30-year bonds are offering 4.85%. After that, the highest rate comes from two 7-month CDs thatguarantee 4.65% APY. But you can earn upward of 4% with almost all of the options below, giving you plenty of opportunities to put your cash where it makes the most sense for you. Note that the ""top rates"" quoted for savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research of hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is very different from the national average, comprising all institutions offering a CD with that term‚Äîincluding many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, national averages are always low, while the top rates we present are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account‚Äîsometimes called ahigh-yield savings account‚Äîthat lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you15 options paying 4.32% to 4.60% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type‚Äîmoney market or savings‚Äîpays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.40% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includesoptions paying up to 4.65% APY. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.99% to 4.23% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds ""swept"" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- to 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.96% to 4.91%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsdirectly fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect‚Äîthe U.S. Treasury‚Äôs online platform for buying federal government securities‚Äîhas no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years.

"2025-04-12 01:00:00";"MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS ALERT: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is Investigating Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. on Behalf of Long-Term Stockholders and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm";" NEW YORK, April  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MPWR) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Monolithic Power Systems on February 4, 2025 with a Class Period from February 8, 2024 to November 8, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Monolithic Power Systems have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. Monolithic Power Systems is a provider of power management components used in electronic systems. Nvidia Corporation ‚Äì the world‚Äôs leading supplier of GPUs ‚Äì is Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô largest customer. The Monolithic Power Systems class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the class period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits were suffering from significant performance and quality control issues; (ii) these defects had, in turn, negatively impacted the performance of certain products offered by Nvidia in which such products were used; (iii) Monolithic Power Systems had failed to adequately address and resolve known issues affecting the performance of the power management solutions Monolithic Power Systems supplied to Nvidia; (iv) Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô relationship with Nvidia had been irreparably damaged due to the significant performance and quality control problems affecting the products it supplied to Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô failure to adequately address such issues; and (v) as a result of the above, Monolithic Power Systems was acutely exposed to material undisclosed risks of significant business, financial, and reputational harm. On October 30, 2024, Monolithic Power Systems announced financial results for its fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, revealing a sudden and surprising slowdown in Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô critical Enterprise Data segment. Specifically, Monolithic Power Systems reported that quarterly revenue within Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô Enterprise Data business declined sequentially to $184 million, down from $187 million in the prior quarter, missing consensus estimates of $211 million by nearly 13%. On this news, the price of Monolithic Power Systems common stock fell more than 17%. Then, on November 11, 2024, Edgewater Research analysts published a report revealing that Nvidia had cancelled half of its outstanding Monolithic Power Systems orders and intended to eliminate Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô allocation to most variants of its next-generation Blackwell chips due to ‚Äú[p]erformance issues‚Äù with Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô products. The report further disclosed that Nvidia engineers had ‚Äúlost confidence‚Äù in Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô products and decided to turn to Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô competitors as Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúprimary suppliers.‚Äù On this news, the price of Monolithic Power Systems common stock fell nearly 15%.

"2025-04-12 12:00:00";"Wall Street Is Souring on the S&P 500‚ÄîHere's Where Forecasters See Stocks Ending the Year";"President Trump‚Äôs tariffs haven‚Äôt just rattled the stock market; they‚Äôve also made it nearly impossible to estimate where stocks are headed. Stock volatility jumped to fresh heights when President Trump on Wednesday, just hours after sweeping ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs went into effect, announced a 90-day pause to most of the charges. The pause sparked the S&P 500‚Äôsbiggest rally since 2008days after the index suffered itsworst rout since 2020. The president‚Äôs unpredictable and unprecedented trade policy has amplified uncertainty among investors, businesses, and consumers, leading to sharp declines in each group‚Äôs economic confidence. Wall Street analysts have responded by slashing their stock market forecasts. Four major firms‚ÄîBank of America, Evercore ISI, Oppenheimer, and JPMorgan Chase‚Äîcut their targets on Monday before tariffs were paused. Bank of America and Evercore both lowered their year-end S&P 500 forecasts to 5,600 from 6,666 and 6,800, respectively. Oppenheimer cut its forecast by more than 16% to 5,950. JPMorgan became the most bearish of them all when it slashed its S&P 500 target to 5,200 from 6,500. The uncertainty stemming from tariffs hasn‚Äôt just weighed on expectations; it has also made forecasting more difficult and contributed to a widening gulf between Wall Street‚Äôs optimists and pessimists. At the start of 2025, the 14 firms tracked by CNBC‚Äôs Market Strategist Survey were projecting the S&P 500 would end the year anywhere between 6,500 and 7,100. By this week, the delta between the low and high forecasts had tripled in size from 600 points to 1,800 points. Excluding firms that haven't updated their year-end forecasts, the range has still expanded by 50% to 900 points. On average, analysts still expect stocks to post a third consecutive positive year. The average forecast of 6,056 is about 3% above the S&P 500's level at the end of 2024 and about 13%above its close on Friday. However, updated forecasts tell a different story. Excluding firms that have yet to change their forecasts in light of Trump's tariff and the recent sell-off, the average S&P 500 target is just 5,733, nearly 3% below where the index started the year and 7% above its current level.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/wall-street-is-souring-on-the-s-and-p-500-where-analysts-see-stocks-ending-the-year-now-11713991"

"2025-04-12 22:26:00";"Trump administration says it will exclude some electronics from tariffs";"The Trump administration late Friday said they would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren‚Äôt usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia and sets the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won‚Äôt be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It‚Äôs the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The exemption seemed to reflect the president‚Äôs realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration‚Äôs predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What‚Äôs more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump‚Äôs decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech‚Äôs ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point earlier this week, the combined Magnificent Seven‚Äôs combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries.    Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. Now, the stage is set for another tech rally Monday when trading resumes in the U.S. stock market, with Apple likely leading the way because the iPhones made in China remain the company‚Äôs biggest money maker. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It‚Äôs the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech‚Äôs hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration‚Äôs and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump‚Äôs first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off ‚Äúa huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,‚Äù said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

"2025-04-13 12:18:00";"Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?";"President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined.getty Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4.  Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced.  Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950Glenview Trust, Strategas Market Performance The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week‚Äôs rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high.  Market PerformanceGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Bond Yields Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was ‚Äúgetting a little queasy‚Äù when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday.  MORE FOR YOUNetflix‚Äôs Best New Show Nabs A Perfect 100% Critic ScoreFed Official Confirms Trump Tariff Bailout Is Ready Amid $30 Trillion Market ‚ÄòPanic‚Äô WarningGmail And Microsoft 2FA Security Bypass ‚Äî Take Action Now, Users Told  Why Did U.S. Treasury Yields Rise? Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield DecompositionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg   Unwinding Of Large Treasury Swap Trades The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher.US Swap SpreadGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023.US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse PeriodGlenview Trust, Bloomberg There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. Selling By Other Countries The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries‚Äô currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.US Dollar WeaknessGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. What To Watch This Week The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday‚Äôs retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter‚Äôs earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation.S&P 500 Earnings SeasonGlenview Trust, FactSet The Only Thing We Have To Fear Is Fear Itself ‚Äî Franklin D. Roosevelt The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside.Volatility RiskGlenview Trust, Bloomberg What‚Äôs Next For Stocks? Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time.Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day GainsGlenview Trust, Strategas Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing.Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day GainsGlenview Trust, Strategas It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock‚Äôs dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

"2025-04-13 16:27:00";"Could the exemption actually be bad for big tech";"Lutnick said today that the exemptions were done so that the exempted items could be included in the coming semiconductor tariffs (in the next month or two), and that the metric for this was so that those tariffs would not be negotiable because they are important for national security. And that this same situation applies to pharmaceuticals.

To me this sounds like he is saying everything not exempted (the stuff still tariffed at 145%) is negotiable, but semiconductors and pharmaceuticals won‚Äôt be negotiable when their new tariffs come.

Like the rest of the world I think Monday will be big green for AAPL, NVDA, etc.  and that the rising tide will probably lift all ships, but in the long run this actually sounds like really bad news for big tech.  There is practically no chance to manufacture those things in the US anytime soon or for a reasonable price and if these tariffs are truly non-negotiable these companies longer term outlook may be very bad.

"2025-04-13 21:58:00";"Special chip tariffs coming";"NASHVILLE, Tenn. ‚Äî Tariff exemptions announced on electronics like smartphones and laptops last week are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they‚Äôre included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,‚Äù Lutnick told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù on Sunday. President Donald Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no ‚Äúexception‚Äù at all because the goods are ‚Äújust moving to a different‚Äù bucket and will still face a 20% tariff as part of his administration‚Äôs move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer¬†devices that aren‚Äôt usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won‚Äôt be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It‚Äôs the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick‚Äôs comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was ‚Äútaking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.‚Äù    The administration has predicted that the trade war would prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What‚Äôs more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech‚Äôs ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven‚Äôs combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning¬†when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech‚Äôs hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump‚Äôs first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes ‚Äúa huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,‚Äù said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick‚Äôs comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House ‚Äúis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.‚Äù Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Originally Published: April 13, 2025 at 5:58 PM EDT";"News";"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/13/special-chip-tariffs-coming/"
"2025-04-14 02:31:00";"Trump & Lutnick‚Äôs Semiconductor Tariff Chaos: A Bull Trap, Insider Trading, and Market Manipulation Exposed";"Alright, Reddit, buckle up because we‚Äôre diving into the absolute rollercoaster that is Trump‚Äôs tariff policy on semiconductors, spearheaded by his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This is a wild ride of mixed signals, market swings, and what smells like blatant manipulation to make billionaires richer while the rest of us get played. If you‚Äôre in the markets or just curious about how the sausage gets made in DC, you need to read this. Monday‚Äôs announcement is going to be a doozy, and I‚Äôm calling it now: we‚Äôre staring down a potential disaster for the semiconductor industry, a textbook bull trap, and some seriously shady insider trading vibes.

Let‚Äôs start with the Friday bombshell. On April 11, 2025, the **Trump administration** dropped a *memo* that had Wall Street doing cartwheels: semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, and a bunch of other electronics were exempted from the massive ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs Trump slapped on China (we‚Äôre talking 125% levies‚Äîinsane). The U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin listed **20 product categories, including memory chips, disc drives, and flat panel displays, all getting a free pass.** Tech stocks like Apple, Dell, and NVIDIA went nuts. The S&P 500 was already down 10% since Trump took office, so this felt like a lifeline. Futures soared, X was buzzing with ‚Äúbull market confirmed‚Äù takes, and everyone thought we were headed for a recovery rally. I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt be bullish? It looked like Trump was giving Big Tech a massive break.

But then, Sunday morning hits, and **Howard Lutnick** goes on ABC‚Äôs This Week and basically says, **‚ÄúPsych!‚Äù** He clarified that those exemptions? Yeah, they‚Äôre *temporary.* Semiconductors and electronics are still getting hit with **‚Äúsector-specific‚Äù** tariffs in **‚Äúa month or two,‚Äù** tied to national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These aren‚Äôt negotiable, unlike the reciprocal tariffs. Lutnick‚Äôs exact words: ‚ÄúThese are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.‚Äù Suddenly, the whole narrative flips. The Friday exemption wasn‚Äôt a win‚Äîit was a head fake. And now, Monday‚Äôs announcement is looming, where Trump‚Äôs expected to double down on these semiconductor tariffs, potentially spelling chaos for the industry.

Let‚Äôs talk about why this is a big deal for semiconductors. The global chip supply chain is insanely complex. Most semiconductors are designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan (TSMC, anyone?), and assembled or finished in places like China. If Trump slaps tariffs on chips coming from China‚Äîor worse, starts a national security probe that messes with the whole supply chain‚Äîprices are going to spike. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm are going to take a hit, not to mention downstream players like Apple, who assemble iPhones in China. Lutnick‚Äôs pushing this ‚Äúre-shore to America‚Äù narrative, but building chip fabs in the U.S. takes years and billions of dollars. TSMC‚Äôs Arizona plant isn‚Äôt even fully online yet! In the meantime, costs go up, supply chains choke, and consumers get stuck with pricier gadgets‚Äîor straight-up shortages.

Now, let‚Äôs get to the bull trap. Friday‚Äôs exemption announcement was like **catnip for traders.** Everyone piled into tech stocks, thinking the tariff threat was gone. But Lutnick‚Äôs Sunday comments yanked the rug out. Posts on X were already screaming about it: ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs exemptions weren‚Äôt surrender‚Äîthey were a setup,‚Äù one user said. Another called it a ‚Äúheadline-driven market‚Äù where the administration is ‚Äústeering price action.‚Äù If Monday‚Äôs announcement confirms heavy tariffs, those bullish bets from Friday are going to get crushed. We could see a brutal sell-off in semiconductor stocks, dragging the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down with it. The market‚Äôs already been a mess‚Äîwildest swings since COVID, down 10% since January 20. This could be the trap that catches all the dip-buyers off guard.

And here‚Äôs where it gets really ugly: the insider trading and market manipulation angle. Let‚Äôs rewind to April 9, when Trump posted on Truth Social, **‚ÄúTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,‚Äù** just hours before he announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries (except China). The S&P 500 surged 9%, Nasdaq jumped 12.2%, and Trump Media‚Äôs stock shot up 22%. Coincidence? Democrats like Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters aren‚Äôt buying it. They‚Äôre calling for SEC investigations, saying Trump‚Äôs post reeks of insider trading. Schiff‚Äôs letter to the White House asked who knew about the tariff pause beforehand and whether anyone traded on it. When Trump was asked when he decided on the pause, he was cagey: ‚ÄúOver the last few days‚Ä¶ probably came together early this morning.‚Äù Yeah, right.

Fast forward to this weekend‚Äôs semiconductor flip-flop, and it‚Äôs d√©j√† vu. Friday‚Äôs exemption pumps the market, Lutnick‚Äôs Sunday reversal sets up a crash, and Monday‚Äôs announcement could be the knockout punch. The timing is too convenient. Billionaires like Bill Ackman, who‚Äôs been cozy with Trump but criticized tariffs, are probably sitting pretty, knowing the playbook. Meanwhile, retail traders who went all-in on Friday are about to get smoked. It‚Äôs not just Trump‚Äôs Truth Social posts‚ÄîLutnick‚Äôs been all over TV, hyping tariffs one day, backtracking the next. The mixed signals aren‚Äôt just chaotic; they‚Äôre starting to look deliberate. As one X post put it, ‚ÄúThe biggest rally of the year would come on the day Lutnick gets fired.‚Äù That‚Äôs the vibe right now.

Why does this matter? Because semiconductors are the backbone of everything. Your phone, your car, your fridge‚Äîthey all need chips. If Trump and Lutnick tank the industry with tariffs, it‚Äôs not just stock prices that suffer. Inflation‚Äôs already a worry (economists have been screaming about tariffs spiking prices), and chip shortages could make 2021‚Äôs supply chain mess look like a picnic. Plus, China‚Äôs not sitting still‚Äîthey hiked their own tariffs to 125% on Friday and are ‚Äúevaluating‚Äù Trump‚Äôs exemptions. This could spiral into a full-blown trade war, and guess who pays the price? Not the billionaires with their offshore accounts‚Äîus.

So, what‚Äôs the play here? Brace yourself. Monday‚Äôs announcement could confirm tariffs that gut semiconductor stocks and ripple through tech. If you‚Äôre holding NVIDIA or TSMC, maybe hedge with some puts. Cash is king if the market tanks. And keep an eye on X and Truth Social‚ÄîTrump‚Äôs posts are basically market signals now, legal or not. The bigger picture? This administration‚Äôs tariff policy is a clown show, and Lutnick‚Äôs either in over his head or part of the game. Either way, the semiconductor world‚Äôs about to get rocked, and not in a good way.What do you all think? Are we headed for a crash? Is this insider trading staring us in the face?

Drop your takes below‚ÄîI‚Äôm all ears.

**TL;DR:** Trump‚Äôs Friday exemption for semiconductors was a head fake that pumped the market. Lutnick‚Äôs Sunday reversal sets up a brutal Monday announcement that could crush the chip industry. This smells like a bull trap, with insider trading and market manipulation letting Trump‚Äôs billionaire buddies cash in while retail gets screwed. Semiconductors are about to take a beating‚Äîwatch out.

No one really reacted to his half-denial about removing tariffs on chips, semiconductors, and computers which, let‚Äôs be honest, sounded more like confusion than policy. If anything, it only made things murkier. And when Trump gets ignored, what does he usually do? Doubles down. More tariffs? Wouldn‚Äôt be shocking.

Meanwhile, China just pulled the plug on rare earth exports. You know, the critical materials needed to make every chip, missile, EV, and iPhone. Trump tried to get Ukraine to help supply these metals last year. It didn‚Äôt work. And China knows exactly how vital this is to U.S. tech dominance.

All major tech players from NVIDIA to Apple rely on these resources. So yes, while the market is green for now, don‚Äôt mistake silence for safety. This might be the setup ‚Äî not the relief.

Bulls are walking into a trap with smiles on their faces.
I hope some of you at least get out with a profit before the hammer drops.

Good luck everyone.

More March 06, 2025 in Barcelona, Spain. (Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images)Getty Images Trefis  Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) has reached a critical support level that has held historical significance. This price range saw nearly ten years of consolidation from 2004 to 2014 before the stock began trending higher, indicating strong buying interest around current levels.  This support seems solid, as shown by the stock‚Äôs ability to hold up following a sharp 30%+ decline in August 2024. While the length of this consolidation is unknown, Intel at $20 presents a compelling value case, though investors should remain mindful of associated risks.   For those seeking gains with lower volatility than individual stocks, check out the High-Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception. INTC Stock Price HistoryTrefis  INTC is available dirt cheap Intel‚Äôs current valuation reflects its recent performance struggles. The company is facing negative revenue growth, while competitors AMD, QCOM, and NVDA are enjoying double-digit increases. With negative earnings, Intel trades at a Price to Sales ratio of just 1.8, versus 6.5 for AMD, 4.2 for QCOM, and 20.3 for Nvidia. This may make Intel more appealing as a long-term value play than a short-term growth bet.  Where is that value going to come from? There are several potential catalysts that could unlock value for Intel:  Recent leadership changes could refocus efforts on Intel‚Äôs core CPU operations and enhance its role in the AI sector. See ‚Äì Is A New CEO Enough To Get Intel Back On Track?

"2025-04-14 11:57:00";"The Most Important Number on Your 401(k) Statement (It's Not Your Balance)";"Your 401(k) balance is important, but it‚Äôs not the best indicator of whether you‚Äôre on track for retirement. Instead, yourrate of returntells you how efficiently your investments are growing over time. A strong return means your money is working harder for you‚Äîregardless of short-term market fluctuations. Understanding this number can help you make smarter decisions and maximize your savings. Here‚Äôs why your rate of return matters, how to interpret it, and what to do if yours seems a bit low. Your401(k) balanceonly tells you how much money is in your account today. It‚Äôs a snapshot in time. Your rate of return, on the other hand, reflects how your investments have performed over time. It accounts for market fluctuations and is typically calculated on an annual basis. Even if the market dips, a solid rate of return means you're still on track. ""I don't want to minimize the importance of balance because, ultimately, if your balance isn't big enough, you may not be able to spend enough,"" said Chris Kampitsis, a Wealth Advisor and Financial Services Executive atBarnum Financial Group. ""But rate of return ultimately indicates how hard your money is working for you. As investors, we want our money compounding, earning interest, and growing over the years."" Many investors misjudge their returns, often comparing them to others or to benchmarks like theS&P 500. Here are some common mistakes: ‚ÄúVery often investors will focus on their rate of return in comparison to the person at the cubicle or office next to them. They might compare in comparison to a benchmark like the stock market, i.e., the S&P 500. But they don't necessarily give context to their particular asset allocation,"" Kampitsis explained. ""So that's not a fair measuring stick to hold yourself to."" Instead of comparing your rate of return to others, focus on whether your investments align with yourlong-term retirement goals. Your personal comfort level withrisk toleranceand the stage of life you're in can directly influence how aggressive or conservative your portfolio should be. You may face a choice between taking on more risk for higher long-term returns or opting for a more conservative approach that sacrifices some growth for stability. ""In general, our rate of return should compensate us for the level of risk we‚Äôre taking on over the long term,"" Kampitsis explained. ""A more aggressive, more equity-focused investor should have a higher long-term rate of return, but they will also have much more deviation from that long-term average in any one or two given years."" Adjusting yourrisk tolerancebased on short-term market conditions can backfire. Selling assets in a downturn locks in losses, while staying invested allows for recovery. If you‚Äôre concerned about your rate of return, consider these steps. ‚ÄúNumber one, we want to figure out why it's under-performing,"" says Kampitsis. He recommends that investors look at their invested funds and how each is performing versus their benchmarks, not just the S&P 500. Also, check if your plan includes high-fee or under-performing funds. ""Most 401(k) plans havefiduciary oversight, so funds should be monitored for reasonable fees and performance,"" says Kampitsis. ""But it's not always the case. Not every menu is going to be perfect. Some funds will under-perform, that's just how that works."" Make sure yourinvestment mixaligns with your risk tolerance. Asset allocation refers to how your portfolio is divided among asset classes, like stocks, bonds, and cash. Be cautious withtarget-date fundsas they may shift too conservative, too soon. Your 401(k) is designed for decades, not short-term gains. Try to avoid‚Äúemotional investing,‚Äùwhich can lead to buying high and selling low. ‚ÄúWhat is your distance to retirement and how long do you anticipate your retirement lasting once you're there? While some of your money you will spend the first day of retirement, it's important to remember that this is still a very long term journey,‚Äù Kampitsis warned. Even a strong rate of return can be eroded by fees and taxes. 401(k) fees reduce your earnings over time, especially if your plan hashigh expense ratios. Taxes on withdrawals can also impact your net income, especially if you‚Äôre in a higher tax bracket. ""Fees are definitely a major component because ultimately that does represent a drag on our rate of return that, when compounded over many years, is a substantial number,"" Kampitsis noted. ""Taxes similarly can ultimately be a huge impediment to us netting the right amount of money that we need."" If you‚Äôre unsure about your 401(k) fees or tax implications, a financial planner can help you optimize your strategy. Your 401(k) rate of return is one of the most important numbers on your statement because it shows how effectively your money is growing. Rather than comparing your returns to others, focus on your own investment mix and long-term goals. If your returns seem low, take a closer look at your fund choices, risk level, and fees. To reduce the impact of taxes and fees, considerRoth contributionsanddiversification. If you review your 401(k) regularly and make thoughtful adjustments, you can stay on track and build a more secure retirement.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/importance-of-rate-of-return-in-401k-11701096"

(Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)VCG via Getty Images Trefis  Why would you pay 38x earnings for IBM stock when Microsoft stock is available at just 30x? The comparison becomes even more favorable for Microsoft when considering three key factors:   Superior Growth Trajectory: Microsoft has delivered strong growth averaging over 12% annually for the past three years, significantly ahead of IBM‚Äôs sub-3% rate. This growth gap indicates a more promising return outlook for Microsoft shareholders. Impressive Profit Margins: Microsoft boasts operating margins above 45%, meaning a greater portion of revenue reaches shareholders. In contrast, IBM‚Äôs figure stands at just 16%. Tariff Resilience: Both Microsoft and IBM are less exposed to tariff risks compared to hardware-centric tech firms, thanks to their substantial software businesses. This offers some protection from global trade tensions. Furthermore, the Trump administration recently announced tariff exemptions for several high-tech imports, such as smartphones, laptops, semiconductor gear, and other electronics.

The stock dropped from nearly $450 in January to under $360 last week, though it has since recovered to around $390. It also declined 36% during the 2022 inflation shock and 28% in the 2020 Covid-19 selloff. Thus, MSFT is not exactly a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù stock. For a more balanced strategy, the Trefis High Quality portfolio has delivered strong results, returning over 91% since launch‚Äîoutpacing broader benchmarks.   Strategic Position In AI And Cloud Microsoft plays a central role in the AI revolution through its Azure cloud services. Just as Nvidia powers AI with GPUs, Azure supplies the necessary infrastructure‚Äîprocessing power, storage, and networking‚Äîthat enables AI innovation across enterprises, including key customers like OpenAI.  By investing in Microsoft, shareholders gain exposure to the broader AI trend without needing to predict which applications will dominate. Microsoft underpins the technological foundation of AI growth, making it a strong contender for long-term value creation.

"2025-04-14 12:15:00";"Will You Outlive Your Savings? Here's How to Boost Your Longevity Literacy";"As Americans juggle the rising cost of living, the decline of pensions, longer lifespans, and other complex factors, median retirement savings stand at only $82,000‚Äîfar below the $1.5 million that Americans believe is enough to retire comfortably. Taking the time to improve your longevity literacy can be worth the effort‚Äîit could help you get your retirement on track. Here's what you need to know. Longevity literacy is knowing how long you're likely to live, particularly in relation to retirement planning. It includes knowing not just life expectancy averages but also the likelihood of living past certain ages and the financial implications of an increased lifespan for your quality of life in retirement. Some experts believe that those with low longevity literacy tend to be less financially secure than they might think. In fact, a 2023 TIAA Institute survey found that most American adults have poor longevity literacy‚Äîmeaning they couldn't tell you the life expectancy of a 60-year-old in the U.S. The TIAA Institute says its mortality tables factor in a tendency toward longer life expectancy due to factors such as education level, type of work a person did, the amount they made, and their access to medical care. According to their data, they assume a 67-year-old will live, on average, another 23 years, with a 25% chance of living 28 years and a 10% chance of making it all the way to age 100. That means saving more for retirement than many people do. To answer the question of how long you're going to live, you can use a life expectancy calculator, like the oneprovided by the Social Security administration. Simply enter your sex and date of birth, and you'll learn how many years, on average, you have left, and the age you'll be when you die. This information, while a bit morbid, is crucial forretirement planning. But be aware it may underestimate your number based on all the same factors that TIAA takes into account. Knowing your number will help you build financial resilience and cultivate a stronger quality of life. ‚ÄúThe years you spend planning for and living in retirement are two fundamentally different seasons of your life‚Äîand can be equally long,‚Äù says Michael Kuplic, CRPC, a financial advisor at Ameriprise. The following tips can help you build a healthy nest egg and be better prepared for the number of years you'll be in retirement. While it‚Äôs easier said than done, contributing more to your savings account will help bridge the gap between your targeted amount and the actual outcome. To do so, it‚Äôs important to set up a plan based on how you would like to live in retirement. ‚ÄúWhile having enough money for retirement is important, it is also imperative to ask yourself,What am I retiring to?‚Äù, Kuplic says. ‚ÄúKnowing what you truly want and need out of retirement is the first step in designing a specific plan to turn those wishes into action.‚Äù Auto-enrollment plansare another avenue for building your retirement savings. You can structure these so that contribution amounts auto-escalate over time. As a general rule of thumb, try to contributeat least 15% of your paycheck. At minimum, contribute enough to qualify for your employer'smatching contribution. Working for longer is a great way to build financial stability in retirement. You might expand your skillset, move into a consultant-type role, or take on part-time opportunities. Working in your '60s isn't uncommon. According to a study from the Pew Research Center, about one in five (nearly 20%) of American workers are 65 or older. That's nearly double what it was three decades ago.And those age 65 and older report greater job satisfaction compared to younger generations. Making the most out of your retirement savings involves adjusting your investment strategy based on your life stage. ‚ÄúThese two phases have fundamentally different goals, risks, and complexities, often needing separate investing and financial planning strategies,‚Äù Kuplic says. Equities historically offer higher returns than bonds. You can afford to place more of yourdiversifiedportfolio in stocks when you're younger. As you age, you'll need to shift the mix toward bonds. For example, short-term bonds can provide an income stream in retirement. It may be a good idea to consult a financial professional to guide you. As lifespans grow longer, the average expected retirement age among people who haven't retired yet is rising. In 2022, it was 66 years old (compared to 60 years old in 1995), according to a Gallup poll.By contributing more to your retirement account(s), working longer, and investing based on yourlife stage, you can improve your chances of success during your retirement years.";"News";"https://www.investopedia.com/longevity-literacy-11707394"

Recent comments from the company‚Äôs CEO during the Q4 2025 earnings call have brought the company's close relationships with key customers into sharper focus, raising questions about prior awareness of product-related challenges. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased Semtech securities and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Aug. 27, 2024 ‚Äì Feb. 7, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Apr. 22, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/smtc Contact the Firm Now: SMTC@hbsslaw.com ¬†¬† 844-916-0895 Semtech‚Äôs Customer Relationships at Center of CopperEdge Delayed Ramp: The lawsuit, Kleovoulos v. Semtech Corporation, et al., centers on claims that Semtech misled investors about the readiness and projected ramp-up of CopperEdge, a critical component for advanced data center interconnects. During the March 13, 2025, earnings call, CEO Hong Hou acknowledged delays, stating, ""We are disappointed that the expected volume ramp would not materialize for FY ‚Äô26 due to rack architecture changes as we previously announced.‚Äù Crucially, CEO Hou also highlighted the company's extensive collaboration with potential and ""anchor"" customers. ‚ÄúWe remain engaged with over 20 potential customers, including hyperscalers, switch makers and the cable suppliers,‚Äù Hou stated. ""Lastly, based on continued collaboration with our anchor customer [reportedly Nvidia], we expect our CopperEdge portfolio to be included in their future generation rack designs."" The Pending Semtech Securities Class Action CEO Hou‚Äôs acknowledgement of close collaboration, specifically regarding ""rack designs,"" has drawn attention in light of the lawsuit's claims that Semtech failed to disclose necessary rack architecture changes. The suit, filed in the Central District of California, claims the company overstated the product's market readiness and projected ramp-up timeline. The complaint alleges claims on behalf of investors who purchased Semtech securities between August 27, 2024, and February 7, 2025. During this period, Semtech allegedly promoted its CopperEdge portfolio, designed for 400G and 800G data center applications using copper cable and backplane interconnects, asserting it provided ""valuable solutions"" to meet customer demands. The complaint alleges Semtech made ""false and misleading statements"" by failing to disclose key information. Specifically, the suit contends the CopperEdge products did not meet the needs of a key server rack customer, required significant rack architecture modifications, and would not achieve the previously forecast fiscal 2026 ramp-up. The revelation of these issues on February 7, 2025, triggered a sharp market reaction. Semtech disclosed that CopperEdge sales would not ""ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026"" due to ""feedback from a server rack customer,"" ""discussions with end users,"" and the need for ""certain rack architecture changes."" The company further revised its sales projections, indicating CopperEdge revenue would fall below the previously stated $50 million floor. The market‚Äôs response was immediate and severe. On February 10, 2025, Semtech‚Äôs stock price plunged by more than 30%, resulting in a loss of over $1.4 billion in market capitalization in a single trading day, according to market data. The lawsuit seeks damages for investors who suffered losses as a result of the alleged misrepresentations. ‚ÄúThe CEO‚Äôs statements regarding close customer collaboration suggest a need for thorough investigation into the timeline of information sharing between Semtech and its customers,‚Äù said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Secret Formula for Faster Trains NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City‚Äôs Housing Shortage The transaction values Altera at $8.75 billion, according to a statement on Monday, about half what Intel paid for it a decade ago. Intel will continue to hold a 49% stake in the business. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Bloomberg reported previously on the talks between the two companies. Intel will receive about $3.4 billion in cash from Silver Lake as part of the deal, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Altera will be run by Raghib Hussain, replacing Sandra Rivera as chief executive officer. Hussain will join from Marvell Technology Inc., where he‚Äôs president of products and technologies. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,‚Äù said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. Silver Lake has a track record in investing in semiconductors companies. It was an early backer of Broadcom Inc‚Äôs acquisition strategy. ‚ÄúThis investment represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in a scale leader in advanced semiconductors,‚Äù said Kenneth Hao, chairman and managing partner of Silver Lake, who added that under new leadership Altera will be focused on investing in ‚Äúemerging AI-driven markets such as edge computing and robotics.‚Äù Shares of Intel rose as much as 6.6% after markets opened in New York. Intel agreed in 2015 to pay $16.7 billion for Altera, whose multiuse chips are primarily deployed in telecommunications networks. In 2024, the US chipmaker said it would look to sell a stake in Altera ‚Äî part of a broader plan to turn its business around. Altera drew interest from Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and a group of buyout firms, Bloomberg News has reported. Intel has lost market share to rivals in recent years and missed the shift to artificial intelligence accelerators, a market now dominated by Nvidia Corp. Intel‚Äôs board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger last year after his comeback plan was slow to gain momentum. Tan, who recently stepped into the role of CEO, said about two weeks ago that the chipmaker will spin off assets that aren‚Äôt central to its mission, and create new products including custom semiconductors to try to better align itself with customers. Intel needs to replace the engineering talent it‚Äôs lost, improve its balance sheet and better attune manufacturing processes to meet the needs of potential customers, Tan told attendees at a company conference.

Wiley believes that Nvidia's exposure to tariffs is quite low, while its valuation is attractive. During the same segment, Wiley praised JPMorgan (JPM) and its first-quarter results which it recently unveiled. Wiley has led companies that have been involved with financial markets since 1996, according to his LinkedIn profile. NVDA's Exposure to Tariffs Is Low, Wiley Says ""Nvidia's exposure to tariffs is less than 5%, some say less than 2%,"" Wiley stated. Moreover, in the low-$90s, the shares ""were on sale,"" he believes. Although the stock's decline naturally generates fear, such declines have historically been good buying opportunities, according to the veteran investor. ""Anytime the Vix exceeds 40, there's a 90% chance that you'll make money in the next three years,"" Wiley told Schwab.¬† And the average return during that period is 50%-80%, he added. JPM Reported Good Results, Wiley Said Asserting that JPM delivered good Q1 results ""across the board,"" Wiley noted that its revenue from equity trading jumped 48% year-over-year, while its earnings climbed significantly. Additionally, its return on tangible equity came in at 7.8%, up from ""closer to 5%"" in March 2023, he added. ""JPM looks safe and sound,"" he said.

Tariffs, the analysts said, are likely to reduce both U.S. GDP and corporate earnings, undermining two of the core drivers of the ""U.S. exceptionalism"" of the past decade-plus. At the same time, Citi estimates U.S. stocks as a whole are historically expensive, ""trading at c80th percentile valuation multiple vs. history"" even after the recent sell-off.

Citi warns that, against this backdrop, ""small shifts in allocation decisions can have an outsized impact."" As U.S. stocks have lost their sheen, international equities have taken on a fresh luster. European and Japanese equities, Citi says, trade at attractive valuations. Japanese equities appear to be pricing in a more substantial earnings contraction than other markets, but ""Japan seems as likely as any market to see reprieve from US tariffs,"" the analysts note. Citi also forecasts that the U.S. market is made even less attractive relative to Europe and Japan by the White House's unpredictability.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Secret Formula for Faster Trains NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City‚Äôs Housing Shortage The dizzying weekend saw Trump exclude popular consumer electronics from 125% tariffs on China and a 10% baseline global tariff. The move exempted more than $101 billion in US imports from China alone and was seen as a short-term win for US tech champions like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Trump and top aides on Sunday, though, declared that the reprieve was only a procedural maneuver to ultimately hit those tech products with a different, sector-specific tariff. Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Then on Monday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he was ‚Äúlooking at something to help car companies‚Äù as they worked to set up manufacturing facilities in the US, ahead of a May 3 tariff deadline on parts. For financial markets handicapping the economic spillovers, that again made finding clarity hard in a strategy the White House insists is carefully constructed but critics see as subject to the whims of a transactional president. An early stock rally on Monday lost momentum and Treasuries extended gains as volatility persisted after seven sessions of big Wall Street swings. Most megacaps fell as the Nasdaq 100 briefly erased what had been a 2.2% jump. For countries sending delegations to Washington to negotiate ‚Äî like the European Union‚Äôs trade chief is aiming to do Monday ‚Äî fresh questions arose about whether talking is even the best approach. And for international companies operating in an environment where rules can change overnight, inactivity during the turmoil is emerging as the safest bet. ‚ÄòAct First‚Äô ‚ÄúThe Trump team continues to follow an approach of act first, then make adjustments as needed,‚Äù said Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade negotiator who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. ‚ÄúThis approach contributes to more unpredictability for investors and our trading partners, who may no longer conclude that rushing to negotiate with the US is the best approach.‚Äù Trump is hailing a flurry of negotiations aimed at locking in reduced country-by-country tariffs, which he has long said he won‚Äôt apply to sectors that have their own levies. Such duties have already been rolled out for autos, steel, and aluminum. More national security investigations that would lead to tariffs are expected in the weeks ahead on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other vital sectors. ‚ÄúWe are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,‚Äù Trump said in a social media post Sunday. ‚ÄúWhat has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.‚Äù China‚Äôs government said the US decision to exempt certain consumer electronics was a small step and called for abolishing tariffs altogether. President Xi Jinping is heading to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week to shore up relationships in the region. In Washington, the frenetic weekend shifts further muddy the water ‚Äî even if Trump‚Äôs administration had long flagged some of them. While Trump has indicated he will haggle over country rates, questions are now emerging over whether the sectoral tariffs are up for bargaining as well. ‚ÄúThose are not available for negotiation,‚Äù Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù Hours later, however, Trump signaled an openness to talks with companies over the scope of his semiconductor tariffs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be discussing it, but we‚Äôll also talk to companies,‚Äù he told reporters on the plane flying back from Florida. ‚ÄúYou have to show a certain flexibility.‚Äù Fueling Inactivity The White House‚Äôs messaging is creating more uncertainty for companies dependent on imports to the US. Detroit‚Äôs Big Three automakers for weeks have lobbied the Trump administration to exclude certain low-cost car components from planned tariffs. General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV have conceded they‚Äôre willing to pay tariffs on completed cars and large components like engines and transmissions, but company representatives have told the administration that broad parts duties would drive up costs by billions of dollars and trigger profit warnings and layoffs that would counter Trump‚Äôs goal of rebuilding US auto manufacturing. ‚ÄúThe whole system seems designed to create paralysis,‚Äù Ryan Petersen, the founder and CEO of digital freight platform Flexport Inc., wrote in a social media post Sunday. Tobias Meyer, chief executive officer of cargo and logistics giant DHL Group, said companies trying to conform with constantly shifting US directives ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know even if something‚Äôs announced, whether two days later it‚Äôs not changed again.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou really see some fatigue of decision makers in manufacturing and also in the distribution sector,‚Äù Meyer said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. ‚ÄúI hear a lot that customers simply say, ‚Äòwe‚Äôll wait for now.‚Äô‚Äù The economic fallout of such a freezing up of trade could be wide. On Monday, Singapore‚Äôs trade ministry downgraded its forecast for economic growth this year, saying businesses and consumers may ‚Äúadopt a ‚Äòwait-and-see‚Äô approach before making spending decisions.‚Äù Diplomats and other officials who‚Äôve sought to engage in talks with the US are similarly unsure about how best to proceed. Bond Market Signals In the wake of Trump‚Äôs April 2 unveiling of his new tariffs, senior administration officials publicly insisted there wouldn‚Äôt be any negotiations over his border levies. Trump‚Äôs goal of repatriating manufacturing was an inviolable priority, they said, and the purpose of the duties imposed in the name of reducing a trade deficit that Trump has declared a national emergency. The weekend pullback on tech tariffs was the second major adjustment to Trump‚Äôs duty regime in a matter of days. On April 9, the same day new duties unveiled the week before went into effect on dozens of countries, Trump abruptly reduced them all to 10% for 90 days ‚Äî except for China ‚Äî amid rapidly increasing concerns about a bond market selloff. There are also more signs that the tariffs and the growing odds of a recession that have come with them are politically unpopular. A CBS poll published Sunday found that a plurality of Americans expect Trump‚Äôs tariffs, which have raised the US‚Äôs average applied duties to their highest level in more than a century, to hurt their financial situation. The administration is now focusing on negotiations with countries including Vietnam, South Korea and Japan. The stated aim is to use the leverage Trump has built up with his tariffs to extract concessions that would open the door for more US exports or new investments in the US. While Trump has dropped tariff rates for those countries to 10% for 90 days to tee up talks, he hasn‚Äôt ruled out raising them again. How successful talks will be remains unclear, as is what exactly Trump wants or how firm he will be in holding to a 10% baseline that he and aides had set as a floor. Flying to Florida on Friday evening, Trump called the 10% ‚Äúpretty close‚Äù to a floor, but he didn‚Äôt rule out going lower. That has opened the door for countries to push for lower tariffs in their own negotiations, including with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic, who will meet his counterparts in Washington today. European officials hope his trip will provide a better sense of the US‚Äôs willingness to negotiate and what its priorities are. But in spite of repeated calls for European unity, there‚Äôs no consensus on how far the bloc should go with concessions, or how to retaliate if talks fail. Trump‚Äôs weekend exclusion did not apply to the baseline 20% tariff he applied to China over fentanyl, and that levy remains in effect. China also has signaled so far that it is not interested in any negotiations. Trump‚Äôs unpredictability still hangs over any talks, as does his commitment to the idea of tariffs as an economic tool. Diplomats involved in discussions with Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer ahead of April 2 said even those cabinet members stressed privately that any agreement would still have to be approved by Trump and that they couldn‚Äôt guarantee his response. Chip Strategy The expected so-called Section 232 national security investigations that would lead to sectoral tariffs could take months. Friday‚Äôs exemption list provides the clearest sign yet of which products could be affected. One key area is AI hardware, which the US imports primarily from Taiwan as well as Mexico, where a host of Taiwanese companies handle final assembly of products destined for the US. AI servers shipped from Mexico have so far escaped the tariffs, as much of that hardware falls under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement tariff exemption, according to Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon. If the eventual chip-sector tariffs do end up hitting servers, one guide for what‚Äôs to come may lie in Trump‚Äôs previous sectoral tariffs for autos and auto parts. Those products, subject to a 25% rate, are eligible for the USMCA exemption until the administration devises a process to impose tariffs on non US-content. But for AI servers and all other products on the exemption list that contain chips ‚Äî including consumer tech like phones and computers ‚Äî there‚Äôs still a huge open question of whether the eventual duties would apply to the entire finished goods, or just the foreign-made chips they contain. Bloomberg Tracker: Every Trump Tariff and Its Economic Effect Trump‚Äôs ultimate aim is to push more of the tech industry to rely on American supply chains. That would require a massive expansion of US chipmaking ‚Äî something that‚Äôs already underway, thanks in large part to the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Trump, however, wants to scrap the bipartisan law, and his latest tariff moves could make it more expensive for companies to complete the factories they‚Äôve announced. Based on Friday‚Äôs exemption list, the chip-sector tariffs could also hit manufacturing tools, which form the lion‚Äôs share of the price tag for new chip plants. --With assistance from Swati Pandey and Haslinda Amin.

This adds a thick layer of uncertainty to what was already a shaky macro backdropespecially for names like Nvidia, which sit at the heart of the AI and hardware boom. Still, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't seem rattled. At the GTC conference, he signaled that the company expects minimal disruption, thanks in part to plans to ramp up domestic production. He also downplayed recession risks, suggesting Nvidia is well-positioned regardless of where the broader economy heads. For now, investors appear to agreeleaning into Nvidia's leadership and resilience, even as clouds gather on the horizon.

"2025-04-14 18:19:00";"NVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) Jumps 14% In One Week After Quantum Machines Partnership";"NVIDIArecently announced a partnership with Quantum Machines to advance quantum computing research, which, alongside its acquisition of Lepton AI Inc., may have supported last week's gain of 14%. Additional collaborations, such as with Fluidstack for Exascale clusters and Kasm Technologies for AI Workspaces, highlight NVIDIA's continued expansion in AI and computing. In the broader market, technology stocks have generally trended upward, benefiting from tariff exemptions on tech products, which aligns with NVIDIA's upward price movement. While the market experienced volatility, NVIDIA's strategic actions added weight to the broader positive trend. NVIDIA has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about. AI is about to change healthcare. These 27 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early. The new partnerships and acquisitions announced by NVIDIA, including those with Quantum Machines, Toyota, and Uber, are likely to enhance NVIDIA's position in AI and quantum computing. These initiatives support the broader narrative of NVIDIA's growth in several sectors, including automotive and data centers. The company's focus on Blackwell architecture and AI scalability could drive revenue and margin improvements by positioning NVIDIA to capture a larger share of enterprise infrastructure investments. With analysts forecasting annual revenue growth of 20.4%, these collaborations may bolster projected earnings of around US$159.1 billion by April 2028, as indicated in current forecasts, although margins are expected to face some pressure. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return, combining share price appreciation and dividends, has been very large, reflecting its significant growth. In comparison to the market, NVIDIA's performance over the past year has exceeded the US Market's return of 4.8%. The share price's recent upward movement aligns with a broader industry trend and NVIDIA's own strategic actions, albeit with regulatory and operational hurdles remaining potential challenges. With the current share price at US$96.3, the recent rally still places NVIDIA at a substantial discount to the consensus analyst price target of US$169.47, suggesting room for growth if expected earnings and revenue materialize as forecasted. However, investors should consider risks such as regulatory issues and Blackwell system costs that could impact long-term profitability. As NVIDIA continues to expand its technological footprint, the alignment of these developments with future earnings forecasts will be critical in approaching the analyst price target.

"2025-04-14 19:04:00";"Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Growth Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?";"We recently published a list of10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires. The stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride for the past few weeks as the sentiment has quickly shifted from post-election bullishness to being priced in for a slow-down or a recession. The volatility can be estimated by the 19% decrease in the S&P 500 from its recent all-time high. To talk about the current market volatility and the way forward, Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee joined CNBC for an interview. He noted that the market is currently pessimistic as recent data shows that they have priced in a 60% probability of a recession, however, it is essential to note that if the tariff situation de-escalates then the probability of a recession isn‚Äôt that high. As a result, Lee thinks that there is a big window of opportunity for stocks to rebound, however, this rebound is contingent on the path of tariff de-escalation. While addressing the concerns that if the market is in a bear market, Lee noted that if we define a bear market by stocks grinding and losing money, then this has been happening since December 2024. However, if you define a bear market as unleashing a type of financial tightening that leads to a recession, the current market does not fit that criteria. Lee acknowledged that it does feel like a bear market for an average person. Lee also talked about the viable investor strategy under the current circumstances. Firstly, he highlighted that people are fighting two brains at the moment, one is a tactical brain, where people want to know if this is the bottom and be convinced by seeing the stocks rally on bad news. On the other hand, there is the investor or the long-term brain, which suggests that people should have confidence in the US companies to navigate this volatility. Lee noted that he is a buyer of this volatility as he thinks that the de-escalation of tariffs will take place, which will result in a big rebound for stocks. To compile a list of the 10 best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires, we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Insider Monkey‚Äôs Billionaire database. Using the screener we aggregated a list of growth stocks that have grown their top-line by more than 30% over the past 3 years and sorted them by market cap. Next, we cross-checked each stock‚Äôs sales growth from Seeking Alpha and ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of billionaire investors. Please note that we have also included the hedge funds sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 3-Years Sales Growth: 69.25% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 Number of Billionaires: 29 Value of Billionaire Holdings: $33,248,032,387 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a high-growth technology company leading the AI revolution through its graphics processing units and system-on-chips units. On April 10, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore maintained their Buy rating on the stock. The analyst noted that the company is positioned well in the market despite potential challenges. He highlighted that one of the key differentiators for the company is that it generates significant revenue from a single product family which increases its influence in the industry. Moreover, Guinness Global Innovators highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as one of its top performers in its Q4 2024 investor letter. The fund highlighted that the company delivered remarkable returns of more than 177.7% during 2024, driven by its GPUs and its application within AI and data center industries. The company holds over 95% market share in advanced AI chips which positions it to capture an estimated $2 trillion AI infrastructure market in the next 5 years. It is the best growth stock to buy according to billionaires. Guinness Global Innovators stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter: ‚ÄúFor a second year running,NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund‚Äôs top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia‚Äôs ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia‚Äôs extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to ‚Äúinference‚Äù (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia‚Äôs financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia‚Äôs data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia‚Äôs technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia‚Äôs valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 1ston our list of best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

"2025-04-14 19:59:00";"Why Ford and General Motors Stocks Popped on Monday";"Shares of U.S. automakers jumped Monday afternoon amid speculation the companies could receive some relief from President Trump‚Äôs25% auto tariffs. Trump reportedly said Monday he was ‚Äúlooking for something to help some of the car companies,‚Äù that ‚Äúneed a little bit of time‚Äù to move operations from Canada and Mexico to the United States. Shares of Ford (F) surged close to 5% in recent trading, after falling as much as 1% earlier in the day, while General Motors (GM) shares, also down 1% earlier in the session, were up nearly 4%. Shares of Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLA), down as much as 1.5% midday following adowngrade by UBS, jumped 5%. Trump over the weekendannouncedthat smartphones, computers, and other electronics will be exempt from the ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs announced earlier this month. The president‚Äôs latest tariff about-face has boosted hopes on Wall Street that there may be more carve-outs to come for select companies, industries, and countries. Carmakers were among the first companies to enter the crosshairs of Trump‚Äôs tariff policies. Ford, GM, and Stellantis‚Äô supply chains were thrown into the spotlight in early February when Trump announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, where the car companies have a major manufacturing presence. Trump watered down those tariffs but subsequently announced a25% tariff on all cars and auto partsnot compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated in his first term.

"2025-04-14 20:00:00";"Which Mag-7 Stock, Apple or NVIDIA, Should You Buy for Tariff Relief?";"With new tariffs being imposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese goods at the beginning of April,Apple IncAAPL andNVIDIA CorporationNVDA saw their stocks decline. However, the latest tariff relief has been a blessing in disguise for these tech behemoths, helping them prevent higher import costs and product price rises. This has prompted speculation on which stock to invest in. Let‚Äôs explore ‚Äì President Trump‚Äôs steep tariffs on goods produced and imported from China could have disrupted Apple‚Äôs supply chains as severely as during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Apple breathed a sigh of relief after the Trump administration exempted electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs. Before the tariff exemption, Apple planned to increase iPhone production in India, which is subject to lower levies, while also securing its supply chain. Apple intends to produce over 30 million iPhones in India, satisfying a significant portion of American demand, which constitutes a third of global demand. However, Apple is manufacturing its upcoming iPhone 17 in China, which will be launched soon. Shifting the production base to India or another location in a short time will require a herculean effort. It may also lead to retaliation from China, which has set up inquiries into U.S. companies and may create difficulties for Apple through its customs processes. A complete breakup from China would be improbable as Apple produces the bulk of its iPhones in China, and there is a dearth of required skills to manufacture iPhones in the United States at the moment. Instead, Apple argued that the United States should boost semiconductor production and revive high-value job opportunities. However, the tariff relief is temporary, and if no breakthrough occurs soon, it may impact Apple‚Äôs near-term profitability. President Trump said that relying on China for vital tech goods like smartphones and semiconductors isn‚Äôt acceptable. If tariffs are imposed, iPhone prices will rise, impacting American consumers and Apple‚Äôs sales volume. Anyhow, some tariffs still apply to goods imported from China and there may be sectoral tariffs on goods that have semiconductors, which can further affect Apple‚Äôs stagnating revenues. Given the supply-chain risks, stagnant revenues and tariff uncertainties, Apple isn‚Äôt a favorable stock choice currently. Moreover, according to the price/earnings (P/E) ratio, Apple stock trades at 27.4X forward earnings. In comparison, the Computer - Micro Computers industry‚Äôs forward earnings multiple is 26.05. The Apple stock, therefore, is overvalued and may plummet if tariff issues remain unresolved. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Like Apple, NVIDIA too got a momentary relief from Trump‚Äôs tariffs. This is because certain critical chips used by NVIDIA and produced in China were exempted. Now, there is a 90-day pause in tariffs, but the outcome depends on how the negotiations between the United States and its trade partners unfold. So, an element of ambiguity persists. However, NVIDIA remains the preferred stock to buy during these times of distress. With graphic processing units (GPUs) continuing to gain popularity at a breakneck speed and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending increasing, NVIDIA‚Äôs long-term future looks brighter. Lest we forget, Apple faces tough competition across all segments, economic challenges, and regulatory hazards, affecting its long-term outlook. Coming back to NVIDIA, the company is experiencing high demand for new Blackwell and older Hopper chips because of their superior AI interfaces compared to competitors. The company‚Äôs CUDA software platform is in more demand among developers thanAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.‚Äôs AMD ROCm software platform. Major cloud computing companies likeAmazon.com, Inc.AMZN andAlphabet Inc.GOOGL¬† are also spending billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure, which could benefit NVIDIA (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy?). NVIDIA stock is currently more affordable than its competitors, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.18 compared to the Semiconductor - General industry‚Äôs 28.4X forward earnings multiple.

"2025-04-14 20:00:00";"Report: Alphabet and Nvidia Bet Big on OpenAI Co-Founder's New AI Startup Valued at $32 Billion";"Alphabet (GOOGL,Financials) and Nvidia (NVDA,Financials) have invested in Safe Superintelligence, a startup co-founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever,according to a person familiarwith the matter cited by Reuters. The startup, known as SSI, was recently valued at $32 billion in a funding round led by venture capital firm Greenoaks, Reuters reported. The investment adds to the growing interest from major cloud and chip firms in backing artificial intelligence developers that require substantial computing infrastructure. Alongside the funding, Alphabet has signed SSI as an anchor customer for its in-house tensor processing units, or TPUs, according to Reuters. Darren Mowry, managing director for startup partnerships at Google Cloud, told Reuters the company is expanding external access to its proprietary AI chips. Google originally reserved TPUs for internal use but has since shifted to selling them at scale to companies developing foundational AI models. SSI is using TPUs primarily over Nvidia's widely adopted graphics processing units, which currently hold more than 80% of the AI chip market, Reuters said, citing unnamed sources. Google Cloud offers both TPUs and Nvidia GPUs to clients. The company's custom TPUs are optimized for certain AI workloads and are designed to be more efficient than general-purpose GPUs, Reuters reported. The strategy mirrors moves by other cloud providers, including Amazon (AMZN,Financials), which is developing its own chips called Trainium and Inferentia. Amazon has also invested in Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor, which continues to use Google's chips despite Amazon's backing, Reuters reported. Microsoft (MSFT,Financials), meanwhile, has invested heavily in OpenAI. Spokespeople for Alphabet, Nvidia and SSI declined to comment, according to Reuters. Reuters also reported that Nvidia has backed other AI startups, including Elon Musk's xAI, as part of its broader push into the AI ecosystem. The investment by Alphabet and Nvidia underscores the deepening ties between infrastructure providers and AI startups that are becoming major customers of their computing platforms, Reuters said.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. In his latest appearance on CNBC‚ÄôsSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer suggested the recent tariffs might not simply be about economic leverage. He hinted at a deeper agenda within parts of the administration that goes beyond trade policy: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty of sense that something‚Äôs going to happen that‚Äôs going to take this away. In fact, just because of what we saw the other day with it going to 10 percent, I don‚Äôt see that at all. I think these are very different kinds of tariffs.

[‚Ä¶] While revisiting the AI and semiconductor trade, Jim Cramer laid out his theory on why NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still a winner, saying: ‚ÄúOkay, here‚Äôs my theory.

"2025-04-14 21:17:00";"Trump Announces Chips, Drug Probes, Opening Door to Tariffs";"(Bloomberg) ‚Äî President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating probes led by the Commerce Department.

The moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president‚Äôs sweeping US trade war.

The Commerce Department said it would be investigating the impact on US national security of ‚Äúimports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment‚Äù as well as ‚Äúpharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products‚Äù in a pair of notices posted to the Federal Register.

The US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.

New levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of chips essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Semiconductor supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.

The administration‚Äôs announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.

Tariffs would also be a blow to the world‚Äôs largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.

Trump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers‚Äô reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.

Trump‚Äôs move on semiconductors is similar to the way he‚Äôs targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. The president has also vowed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and possibly critical minerals.

Under Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.

Trump has cast reshoring chipmaking and revitalizing the US industrial base as essential for the nation‚Äôs security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work work.

**Worldwide Impact**

The move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (‚Ç¨47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump‚Äôs wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country‚Äôs favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship drugs to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.

The US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.

Nearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they‚Äôd be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they‚Äôd need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.

‚ÄúRe-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,‚Äù BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.‚Äù

**Trump‚Äôs Exemptions**

The US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.

The announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,‚Äù Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. ‚ÄúAnd so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‚ÄòHey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,‚Äô then he‚Äôs absolutely willing to listen. And if he‚Äôs convinced, then he‚Äôll make the call to do something like he did today.‚Äù

Trump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.";"Reddit";"https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jzab4g/trump_announces_chips_drug_probes_opening_door_to/"

Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, explains why Nvidia's domestic manufacturing push isn't moving the stock. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. What I can't figure out, maybe you can help us understand it, is Nvidia. Right? Now they're going to, uh, build chips and AI platforms here in the US. So certainly, uh, tariffs aren't going to be relevant for them once that's up and running in a year. And yet the stock is barely up today, maybe half a percent. Can you help us understand why Nvidia isn't up more? Yeah, I think Nvidia has a lot of other things going as well. There is this suspicion that AI has run its course, uh, things like that. You know, maybe people have already got their chips already. So things like that. Then we had Deepseek, and there's some alternatives to Nvidia. Maybe you can do things cheaper and faster in some other ways. So that that total dominance of Nvidia is being threatened, though I don't believe that. Nvidia is still the major player. Uh, you need them for everything from robotics to cars to everything else. They are the core piece of every all the things that are going on, or that are coming down the pike. So I don't think Nvidia is at risk, but on the face of it, I think there is a risk. There is that feeling that maybe it's not smooth sailing. They're going to have some, they need to do some reinvention and be ahead of the game. So there are some challenges ahead. So they had other issues going as well. Uh, and Nvidia is playing the tariff game pretty well. They're well-positioned. They're already in, uh, in Arizona, and they agree to spend $500 million, which, billion, I think that's that's great as well. So I think they're doing the right things, so I think they're okay. But overall, I think AI, the whole whole setup around AI is kind of not as smooth as it was before.";"News";"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-nvidias-500b-ai-build-202557360.html?.tsrc=rss"

We cover refinancing every business day, including thenational average refi ratefor all major loan types, as well asstate-by-state refi averages. The full article continues below these offers from our partners. The market chaos triggered by President Trump's moving-targettariffannouncements has not spared mortgage rates. Though initially a stock market sell-off prompted a drop in 10-year Treasury yields, which in turn pushed mortgage rates lower, that trend has now reversed. The 10-year Treasury yield soared last week, whichhas confounded many experts. But what's not surprising is that the surge in bond yields has pushed mortgage rates up dramatically. The latest one-week change for each new purchase loan average is shown below, followed by a deeper dive into 30-year, 15-year, and jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loans. Rates on 30-year new purchase loans shot up a remarkable 44 basis points last week, rising to a7.14% average.It's the biggest Friday-to-Friday gain for the flagship average since June 2022, and raises it to its most expensive level in almost 11 months. Things were better in September, when the 30-year average plunged to a two-year low of 5.89% (the cheapest Friday average being 6.03%). So far this year, the lowest weekly reading has been 6.55%. Every business day, we publishnational rate averages for various loan types, and alsoeach state's 30-year rate average. Right now, New York and Florida have the lowest 30-year rates. Rates on 15-year new purchase loansalso shot up last week, gaining a dramatic 54 basis points to end last week at a 6.31% average.That's now above the 2025 peak of 6.22%, and more than a full percentage point above the two-year low of 4.97% registered in September. Rates on jumbo 30-year new purchase loans climbed 44 basis points over past week, landing Friday at a 7.15% average. That's almost a quarter percentage point above the 2025 high of 6.95%. In contrast, September rates on new 30-year jumbo loans sank as far as 6.24%, with the lowest weekly average registering at 6.39%. Ajumbo mortgageis one that exceeds the maximum loan limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming loans‚Äî$806,500 for single-family homes in most parts of the U.S. in 2025, but up to $1,209,750 in certain more expensive areas. To see how much this week's rate increases would impact monthly payments for new borrowers, our tables below lay out theprincipal-plus-interest paymentfor various loan amounts with a 30-year, 15-year, or jumbo 30-year fixed-rate new purchase mortgage.

But the bounce may not last. Tech giants could still face drastic changes to how they manage their supply chain and costs. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick toldABC Newson Sunday those electronic products are going to be part of tariffs affecting the semiconductor sector ""which are coming,"" potentially in a month or two. Apple stock rose 2% to $202.52 a share on Monday, a boost from the stock's sharp decline after Trump announced reciprocal tariffs earlier this month. Google parent company Alphabet and chip maker AMD also got a reprieve, with their stock prices rising 1% on Monday. Read more:'Nowhere to hide.' How Apple and others in Silicon Valley are bracing for Trump tariffs Apple stock plummeted after Trump announced extra tariffs on China, Vietnam and India on April 2. Trump has since paused additional tariffs on most countries, but has raised duties on Chinese imports to 145%. ""We need to have these things made in America, we can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us,"" Lutnicktold ABC, adding that the goal is for the companies to bring more of their manufacturing back to the United States. The escalating conflict has worried investors because Apple and other tech companies produce many products in China. Though it has shifted more production to India in recent years, Apple still makes most of its iPhones in mainland China. Amid more pressure from the White House, Apple and Nvidia have announced plans to bring more jobs to the U.S. Nvidia on Monday said it is working with its partners to build and test Nvidia Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas, with production ramping up in the next 12 to 15 months. ""Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement. Nvidia's stock price closed at $110.71 on Monday, virtually unchanged. Apple in February said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. that would go toward various efforts, including opening a manufacturing facility in Houston. Still, analysts say it will be difficult to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and rebuilding supply chains could take years.

Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? The Secret Formula for Faster Trains Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City‚Äôs Housing Shortage President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating trade probes led by the Commerce Department. The moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president‚Äôs sweeping US trade war. The Commerce Department said it had begun investigating the impact on US national security of ‚Äúimports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment‚Äù as well as ‚Äúpharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products‚Äù in a pair of register notices. Listen to the Here‚Äôs Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. The probes, which began April 1 and were ordered under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, could play out for months. Under the law, the Commerce Secretary is expected to deliver the results of his investigation within 270 days, though Trump and other officials have signaled these efforts could conclude more quickly. The US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans. New levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of semiconductors essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties. The administration‚Äôs announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips. The Commerce Department investigation on semiconductors is designed to have a wide range, evaluating imports of both legacy and leading-edge chips that are coveted for artificial intelligence applications. The probe will span imports of all semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them as well as electronic products that contain the components, according to the government notice. Tariffs on the semiconductor sector risk affecting a wide range of companies that send billions of dollars in microprocessors and related goods to the US each year. Foreign makers of advanced chips including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix of South Korea could be forced to raise prices or accept smaller margins if Trump delivers on his threat of import levies. The measures also threaten to impose higher costs on Trump‚Äôs vision for expanding domestic semiconductor production, especially if imported chip-manufacturing equipment from companies like ASML Holding NV gets hit with tariffs. Netherlands-based ASML is a leading provider of advanced lithography machines used to produce the smallest computer chips used in AI and other sensitive applications. The separate drug probe will examine imports of all pharmaceuticals ‚Äî both finished generic and non-generic medicines ‚Äî as well as the ingredients used to make them. Investigators also will probe imports of critical pharmaceutical inputs. The public is invited to weigh in on both probes with comments over the next 21 days. Tariffs would also be a blow to the world‚Äôs largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe. Alex Schriver, spokesman for the trade group PhRMA, said in a statement that the pharmaceutical industry shares Trump‚Äôs goal of boosting US manufacturing. While he said the industry would work with the administration throughout its process, he added that ‚Äúmedicines have historically been excluded from tariffs because they can lead to higher costs and shortages of life-saving medicines.‚Äù Drug companies have raced to announce major investments in the US ahead of potential tariffs. Most recently, Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG said it plans to invest $23 billion in the US over the next five years, following earlier pledges from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson. But experts warned that likely wouldn‚Äôt blunt the impact of the tariffs. ‚ÄúThere is no quick fix for exposed companies, in our view,‚Äù Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note to clients ahead of the announcement. ‚ÄúRedomiciling manufacturing would take years and be very costly.‚Äù Drugmakers will face a choice between eating the costs of potential tariffs or raising prices for their medicines in what is already the most expensive market in the world. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot at stake politically I think for branded manufacturers to be increasing prices here,‚Äù said Marta Wosi≈Ñska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution‚Äôs Center on Health Policy. ‚ÄúI do think there‚Äôs going to be reluctance to passing through price increases.‚Äù Because there are some controls on the price of drugs, tariffs could end up hurting drugmakers‚Äô bottom line, leading them to scale back research, according to Lilly Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks. ‚ÄúWe have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade offs within our own companies,‚Äù Ricks recently told the BBC. ‚ÄúTypically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D) and I predict R&D will come first. That‚Äôs a disappointing outcome.‚Äù Trump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers‚Äô reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds. Worldwide Impact Trump‚Äôs move on semiconductors is similar to the way he‚Äôs targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. Under former President Joe Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications. Trump has cast revitalizing the US chipmaking industry and industrial base as essential for the nation‚Äôs security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work. The move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (‚Ç¨47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump‚Äôs wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country‚Äôs favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis. The US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote. Nearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they‚Äôd be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they‚Äôd need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products. ‚ÄúRe-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,‚Äù BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs Exemptions The US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US. The announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,‚Äù Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. ‚ÄúAnd so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‚ÄòHey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,‚Äô then he‚Äôs absolutely willing to listen.‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said the administration remained focused on negotiating deals that would benefit Americans. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to start the negotiations, and just like with everyone else, I‚Äôm telling them, bring your A-game. We‚Äôll see what you got, and we‚Äôll go from there,‚Äù Bessent said. Trump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place. --With assistance from Michael Shepard, Annmarie Hordern, Hadriana Lowenkron and Derek Wallbank.

"2025-04-15 08:51:00";"Nvidia Has 3 Considerably Bigger Concerns Than Tariffs";"""Buckle up and hold on"" has been something of a theme for Wall Street over the last two weeks. Ever sincePresident Donald Trump unveiled his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, theDow Jones Industrial Average,S&P 500, andNasdaq Compositehave logged some of their largest single-session point gains and declines since their respective inceptions. Whereas the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks were responsible for leading the broader market higher for more than two years, these highly influential businesses have taken it on the chin during the recent sell-off. For instance, Wall Street'sartificial intelligence (AI)darlingNvidia(NVDA-0.18%)briefly became the world's largest public company and sported a market cap of nearly $4 trillion during the first week of January. But since reaching its closing high on Jan. 6, it's shed 26% of its value (as of April 11), and plunged by as much as 36% (as of April 8). Image source: Getty Images. Some investors might quick to assign the blame for this weakness on uncertainty tied to President Trump's tariff announcement. Although Trump has issued a 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs for most countries, a series of escalating tariffs between the U.S. and China could be problematic. Even though Nvidia doesn't import from China, the world's No. 2 economy is one of Nvidia's core markets by net sales. Retaliation from China could take the form of shunning Nvidia's AI hardware. Initially, Trump's Liberation Day announcement alsocalled for a higher tariff on Taiwan, which is home to world-leading chip fabricatorTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.90%). TSMC, as Taiwan Semi is more commonly known, is akey provider of chip-on-wafer-on-substrate packaging technologythat incorporates the high-bandwidth memory needed to make AI-accelerated data centers tick. Thankfully, an update this past weekend from the president ensured that chips and chip equipment would be excluded from reciprocal tariffs. Tariffs, and the uncertainty created by President Trump changing when and what tariffs go into effect, are a problem for Nvidia. However, tariffs are pretty far down the list of things current and prospective Nvidia shareholders should be worried about. Three other factors are far more likely to be responsible for weighing down Nvidia stock. Competition is pretty much a universal problem for publicly traded companies. Even though Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) and successor Blackwell GPU architecture currently account for the lion's share of GPU market share in high-compute data centers, they're not impervious to growing competition. Most investors are probably focused on external direct competitors, such asAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.19%).AMD continues to develop new generations of its Instinct series AI-accelerating chips, all of which have been notably less-costly than Nvidia's AI hardware. Businesses that are unwilling to wait in a long queue for access to Nvidia's AI chips might opt for AMD's Instinct GPUs. But there's a bigger threat for Nvidia than AMD and its peers --a threat that emerges from within. Many of the largest GPU orders received by Nvidia have come from members of the Magnificent Seven. The problem is that these industry goliaths are also internally developing AI chips and/or solutions of their own to use in their data centers. Even though this internally developed hardware is unlikely to be superior to Nvidia's in terms of computing speed, it's considerably cheaper and more readily available (i.e., not backlogged). Put another way, Nvidia can continue to introduce new AI-GPUs annually and still lose valuable data center real estate to its own top customers. That's bad news for future orders and Nvidia's already retracing gross margin. Image source: Getty Images. A second issue that's more of a worry than tariffs is the possibility of history rhyming, once more, on Wall Street. For the better part of the last three decades, investors have had a next-big-thing technology or innovation to hold their attention. It's not uncommon for investors to be drawn in by pie-in-the-sky addressable market figures attached to a potentially game-changing technology or trend. However, every next-big-thing trend since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s has endured the same fate:a bubble-bursting event. Professional and everyday investors consistently overestimate how quickly a new trend or technology will earn widespread adoption and/or gain meaningful utility, which is what leads to lofty expectations not being met. Though we've witnessed aggressive enterprise spending on AI infrastructure, there's little evidence to suggest that businesses are generating a positive return on these AI investments or have figured out how to optimize their AI solutions. It takes time for all new technologies and trends to mature, and it's safe to say that artificial intelligence isn't anywhere close to this point as of yet. If history were to rhyme and investor expectations are reset,there's arguably not a public company that would be hit harder than Nvidia.  NVDA PS Ratiodata byYCharts. PS Ratio = Price-to-sales ratio. The third issue that's a considerably bigger concern than tariffs for Nvidia is its valuation. Last summer, Nvidia'sprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiopeaked at 42.39, which is consistent with the peak P/S ratios of market-leading businesses prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. Even though Nvidia's P/S ratio has been halved since last summer to 21.06, this is still double the premium assigned to the priciest Mag-7 stocks, relative to their sales. As alluded earlier, Nvidia's generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) gross margin has begun rolling over, as well. Exceptional pricing power for its GPUs, along with AI-GPU scarcity, helped lift its GAAP gross margin to a peak of 78.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 (ended April 28, 2024). However, its GAAP gross margin has fallen in each successive quarter andis forecast to dip to 70.6%(+/- 50 basis points) in the fiscal first quarter of the current year. Waning AI-GPU scarcity and the company's own accelerated product replacement cycle could be an ongoing drag on margins. Nvidia's efforts to bring a new AI-GPU to market annually could lead to rapid depreciation of prior-generation AI-GPUs, as well as lessen the desire by existing customers to upgrade to next-gen hardware. While the very long-term outlook for artificial intelligence solutions and Nvidia remains bright,Nvidia stock could easily underwhelm in the coming quarters, regardless of what happens on the tariff front.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/15/nvidia-3-considerably-bigger-concerns-than-tariffs/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=e34317bd-404f-4f9f-87da-823db6e2c559&.tsrc=rss"

As a result, the Nasdaq-100 is in the throes of a bear market after plunging by as much as 23% from its February record high. But that might be a big opportunity for investors. Shares of Nvidia and Alphabet are down by more than 20% from their all-time highs, yet most of the products they sell are either exempt from President Trump's tariffs or were never impacted to begin with. Here's why it might be a great idea for investors to buy the dip, with the intention of holding Nvidia and Alphabet for the long run. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia sells the world's most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which have set the benchmark when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) development. It all started with the H100 GPU, which helped the company win 98% of the market in 2023, as it was the best chip for traininglarge language models(LLMs) and performingAI inference. These models generated ""one-shot"" responses to user inputs, which was useful at the time, but they often made mistakes. Rather than feeding LLMs an endless amount of training data, developers are now building ""reasoning"" models that spend more time thinking before generating a response. In other words, they make better use of the data they already have and weed out inaccuracies in the background before rendering a response for the user. Some of the best reasoning models available today includeOpenAI'sGPT-4o series, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek's R1, and Alphabet's Gemini 2.5. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, these models require a staggering100 times more computing powerthan traditional LLMs. He says each response they generate consumes 10 times more tokens (words and symbols) because of how much time they spend thinking. Plus, that makes them much slower to render responses, so GPUs need to be 10 times faster to offset the delays -- otherwise, users might grow tired of the whole experience. As a result, Nvidia's Hopper architecture (which is at the foundation of the H100 GPU) is no longer sufficient. Instead, developers are transitioning to Nvidia's Blackwell-based GPUs like the GB200, which can perform AI inference at 30 times the speed of the H100. The company also revealed an upgraded architecture called Blackwell Ultra during the GTC 2025 conference in March, which delivers up to 50 times more performance than Hopper. Nvidia's data center business generated a record $115.2 billion in total revenue during its fiscal year 2025 (ended Jan. 26), which was a whopping 114% increase from the prior year. But Huang believesAIdata center infrastructure spending will top $1 trillion annually by 2028 as reasoning models grow more power-hungry, so Nvidia's opportunity is set to grow significantly from here. Investors can buy Nvidia stock at a very attractive valuation right now. It trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 37.7 as of this writing, which is a 36% discount to its 10-year average of 59.6:  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts Semiconductors are exempt fromPresident Trump's tariffson Taiwan, which is where many of Nvidia's chips are fabricated. However, the company does face uncertainty because it relies on hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center spending from just a handful of customers to fuel its growth, so if trade tensions dent the global economy, some of those buyers could revise their capex plans. However, this is likely to be a short-term headwind because countries are already negotiating trade deals with the Trump administration. Therefore, investors who buy Nvidia stock at the current price could still do extremely well over a time frame of three to five years. Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet is the tech conglomerate behindGoogle, YouTube, self-driving car developer Waymo, and more. Since Google has been the window to the internet for over two decades, Alphabet has a bigger stockpile of valuable data with which to develop powerful AI models than almost any other company, and it's putting it to good use. Alphabet launched theGemini2.5 Pro reasoning model earlier this month, and the company says it outperforms the latest models from OpenAI,Anthropic, DeepSeek, and evenElon Musk'sxAI across several benchmarks. It powers a stand-alone chatbot called Gemini, but it will also help Alphabet further improve the new AI features in Google Search -- and this is critical because the advertising dollars brought in by the search engine still account for over half of the conglomerate's total revenue. Alphabet introduced AI Overviews for Google Search last year, which combines text, images, and links to third-party websites to produce AI-generated responses to almost any query. Overviews appear at the top of the traditional search results, so they can save users from sifting through web pages to find the information they need. So far, Alphabet says Overviews monetize just as well as the traditional search format, so it appears they won't disrupt the company's golden goose. Alphabet doesn't just develop AI for its own purposes -- it also sells a range of services to help businesses and developers achieve their goals in this space via the GoogleCloud platform. It offers access to powerful data center infrastructure and ready-made models like Gemini to help developers accelerate their AI software projects. In the final quarter of 2024, Google Cloud customers were using eight times more computing capacity than they were 18 months earlier, which highlights how quickly AI adoption is scaling. Alphabet is currently the cheapest stock in theMagnificent Seven. Based on the company's $8.04 inearnings per sharelast year, its stock trades at a P/E ratio of just 19.5:  TSLA PE Ratiodata byYCharts The rest of the Magnificent Seven stocks trade at an average P/E ratio of 31.3 (excludingTesla because its sky-high valuation is an outlier), so Alphabet stock would have to soar by 60% just to catch up. Alphabet's advertising revenue could take a hit if global trade tensions spark an economic slowdown because businesses would probably trim their marketing budgets. But aside from that indirect consequence, the company primarily sells digital products and services that are excluded fromtariffsat the moment. Setting trade tensions aside, Alphabet's leadership position in the AI race could make it a fantastic addition to any portfolio over the long term, especially at the current price.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/15/nasdaq-bear-market-2-magnificent-seven-stocks-dip/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=506642e2-ef5c-4b3c-aaea-2f1140f48378&.tsrc=rss"

The information technology sector is the largest by a wide margin, representing 29.9% of the entire value of the index. The S&P 500 recently suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 19%, falling just shy of the bear-market threshold of 20%. However, theS&P 500 Information Technologyindex plunged by as much as 26%, placing it firmly in bear territory.Apple,Microsoft, andNvidiaare just some of the heavyweights in the information technology sector, so it's a good proxy for the performance of some of America's most valuable companies. TheVanguard Information Technology ETF(VGT0.72%)exclusively invests in stocks from the information technology sector (including those inside and outside the S&P 500), and it has outperformed the S&P 500 every year, on average since it was established in 2004. Therefore, investors with a spare $550 might want to take the opportunity to buy one share in this fund while it's trading at a discount during the tech bear market. Image source: Getty Images. On April 2, President Trump announced plans to impose a sweeping 10%tariffon all physical products imported into America, in addition to a series of much higher ""reciprocal"" tariffs on goods from specific countries. The reciprocal tariffs have since been paused for 90 days pending negotiations between the U.S. and its trading partners, except for those placed on China, which remain active. Sweeping tariffs have immediately increased the cost of living for consumers, which could dent America's economic growth. Plus, some countries have imposed their own tariffs in retaliation, which will also hurt U.S. exporters. This is a cocktail for weaker corporate earnings, which is whythe S&P 500 suffered such a sharp declineover the last few weeks. However, many of the products and services produced by companies in the information technology sector aren't directly affected by the tariffs, which is why I believe the sector's underperformance relative to theS&P 500represents a big opportunity for investors. For example, semiconductors have been excluded from President Trump's tariffs from the beginning, which means the industry-leadingartificial intelligence(AI) chips produced by companies like Nvidia andBroadcomwon't be affected. Moreover,Microsoftprimarily sells digital products like the Windows operating system and 365 productivity suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), in addition tocloud servicesthrough its Azure platform. None of those are subject to the tariffs (for now). Further, last weekend, President Trump announced that smartphones and computers will be removed from the reciprocal tariffs that are still in place on imports from China. This significantly benefits Apple, which manufactures around 90% of its iPhones in that country. Below is a list of other holdings in the Vanguard Information TechnologyETFthat primarily sell software, cloud services, digital products, or exempted products like semiconductors: Stock Vanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting Salesforce 1.78% Oracle 1.72% Accenture 1.38% Adobe 1.22% Palantir Technologies 1.13% Qualcomm 1.12% Advanced Micro Devices 1.02% Palo Alto Networks 0.81% Micron Technology 0.68% CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) 0.63% Data source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Feb. 28, 2025, and are subject to change. The Vanguard ETF holds 314 different stocks. However, the above 10 stocks, combined with Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, account for a whopping 61.7% of the entire value of its portfolio. With all of that said, even though the above companies aren't directly impacted by tariffs, they are likely to suffer indirect consequences from President Trump's trade policies. If the U.S. economy does slow down, they will experience weaker demand for their products and services. This effect could be especially pronounced for the likes of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, which are relying on hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure spending from just a handful of customers each year to fuel their growth. Some of that potential risk is already priced in.Nvidia stock, for instance, is down by 25% from its record high, wiping a staggering $900 billion off the company'smarket capitalization. That reduces the potential downside risk for investors who swoop in and buy the Vanguard ETF today. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF was recently down by as much as 27% from its record high, so it's heavily underperforming the S&P 500 at the moment. However, the picture looks very different when we zoom out and examine its long-term performance. The Vanguard ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 12.8% since it was established in 2004, comfortably beating the average annual gain of 9.6% in the S&P 500 over the same period. That 3.2 percentage point difference doesn't sound like much at face value, but it would have made a world of difference in dollar terms thanks to the magic of compounding: Starting Balance In 2004 Compound Annual Return Balance In 2025 $50,000 12.8% $627,279 $50,000 9.6% $342,761 Calculations by author. In my view, even if the economy slows due toglobal trade tensions, investors are likely to continue buying quality stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. These companies have incredibly strong balance sheets with plenty of cash on hand, in addition to reliable earnings and leadership positions in their respective industries. They could still be the best houses in a bad neighborhood, so to speak, as the rest of the market faces the same economic challenges. Plus, PwC predicts the AI revolution will add a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and much of that value will be created by the companies in the information technology sector. As a result, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF might be a great buy during the tech bear market.";"News";"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/15/1-spectacular-vanguard-etf-to-buy-with-550-during/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=592446b5-2269-4467-806d-4c6c5baffb6f&.tsrc=rss"
"2025-04-15 10:57:00";"Intel: Overblown Optimism Meets Stark Reality";"Intel is staring down multiple challenges that could fundamentally change the company as we know it. To say I'm surprised by its stock recovery would be an understatementsince early February, Intel has outperformed its semiconductor peers by a wide margin. The return of Lip-Bu Tan as CEO, after his abrupt resignation in August 2024 over issues like a bloated workforce, a cautious approach to innovation, and an underperforming AI strategy compared to NVIDIA's clear dominance, has certainly stirred things up. Tan's comeback has reignited investor enthusiasm, even though I'm still cautious about whether his leadership will deliver sustained gains. After all, he wasn't entirely unhappy with how Gelsinger was running things, particularly regarding the manufacturing strategy. That said, I must give credit to Tan's stellar track record as CEO at Cadence, where his leadership drove a surge in value exceeding 3,000%. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC. INTCData byGuruFocus However, investors should keep in mind that turnarounds take time, no matter how much was done by previous leadership. While Tan is undoubtedly a respected veteran with deep relationships across the semiconductor value chain, I believe that the initial euphoria is already priced into the stock and that the market will become more cautious moving forward. In this article, I'll outline my doubts and explain why, at this moment, I'm not fully buying into the hype around Intel. Intel is staring down multiple challenges that could fundamentally change the chip company as we know it today. The recovery in Intel's stock has been surprisingsince early February, Intel has outperformed its semiconductor peers by a significant margin. The return of Lip-Bu Tan as the new CEO on March 18, 2025, has rekindled his relationship with the board following his abrupt resignation in August 2024, when he was reportedly dissatisfied with Intel's bloated workforce, overly cautious approach to innovation, and an underperforming AI strategy compared to NVIDIA's clear dominance. Although Tan's comeback has sparked renewed optimism and pushed the stock higher by over 10%, I remain skeptical about whether his leadership will generate sustained gains, especially since he wasn't entirely unhappy with how Gelsinger was steering the company away from his key manufacturing strategy. However, I must give due credit to Tan's proven track record as Cadence CEO, during which the company's value surged by more than 3,000%. Investors should remember that turnaround efforts take time, regardless of past achievements, and while Tan is a highly respected veteran with deep industry relationships, I believe the initial euphoria has already been priced into the stock. Tan's return to the board also means that he isn't entirely opposed to the manufacturing strategy that Gelsinger implementedto reshape Intel's semiconductor fabrication into a foundry service for external customers. This plan, however, should raise a red flag for Intel investors. Manufacturing chips is an enormous expense that Intel currently struggles to sustain, a view shared by many industry leaders and analysts. Despite early-stage discussions with competitors like Broadcom, Qualcomm, GlobalFoundries, and TSMC, a deal to sell all or part of Intel's business appears unlikely in the near term. In my opinion, a more realistic outcome might be a joint venture, perhaps with TSMC, which has recently floated the idea of a potential partnership regarding Intel's chip-making business. Such a joint venture could help reorganize Intel's struggling foundry segment, which has incurred massive losses. For context, Intel's foundry lost $8.1 billion in 2024 on a gross margin basisbefore considering $5.4 billion in operating expenditurescompared to a loss of $2.6 billion the previous year. Alternatively, a spin-off might be on the table, with Intel retaining a majority stake, but if a joint venture does not materialize, Intel may face even tougher competition, especially as TSMC looks to invest more aggressively in U.S. production, fueled in part by policy initiatives like the CHIPS Act now under intense government scrutiny. Intel's disappointing execution in the data center chip market, coupled with its failure to develop competitive GPUs, has led to a significant contraction in operating cash flow over the past couple of years. Since 2020, Intel's operating cash flow has dropped by 77%, and the company has experienced three consecutive years of negative adjusted free cash flow. The enormous losses in the foundry business further compound these issues, making it increasingly difficult for Intel to steer its overall business toward profitability. The new CEO, Tan, has an opportunity to turn the struggling chip maker around, but he will need to act decisively to cut losses and reduce cash burnpossibly by slashing the bloated employee base once again. Intel recently announced a massive restructuring in August, cutting roughly 15% of its 125,000 employees, though these disruptive cuts might not help attract top talent. INTCData byGuruFocus The decline in top-line revenue forecastsfrom over $60 billion in early 2024 to below $54 billion nowreflects these ongoing challenges, as Intel lags behind competitors like NVIDIA and AMD, and even loses market share in the CPU, GPU, and data center markets. For instance, Intel's x86 CPU market share fell to 75-80% in 2024 from 82% in 2023, while AMD and Apple's in-house chips have further eroded Intel's presence. In the GPU space, Intel is far behind NVIDIA's ~88% market share, and alternatives like ARM chips, AWS Graviton, and Google TPUs are gaining traction. From a margin perspective, Intel's performance has been disappointing. Historically, Intel's gross margins ranged between 55-60%, but this year they have fallen sharply to 33.8%. The new CEO has hinted at further restructuring to address a bloated headcount of 105K, a number that far exceeds the approximately 30K employees at competitors like NVIDIA and AMD. Although Intel's chip design business does not encompass the entire employee base, the overall high headcount is unsustainable. With declining revenue expectations and mounting pressure to reduce costs, Intel's management likely faces another 18+ months of restructuring before the turnaround can be considered effective. The new CEO must quickly address the foundry challenges, possibly by divesting or restructuring that segment, and resolve the AI GPU issues before the stock can become attractive. While there is some hope that improved operations, along with $8 billion to $11 billion in partner contributions and government incentives, could lead to positive adjusted free cash flow this year, any further delay in revenue and earnings recovery could result in another cycle of cash burn. Because Intel is expected to report almost no profit this yeareven on a non-GAAP basisits valuation looks very high. INTC's forward earnings multiple of almost 50x (significantly above the likes of NVIDIA, AMD, and TSMC) suggests that the market has factored in a lot of optimism on Tan's return, while the details on how he plans to turn the chipmaker around remain unclear. To me, this indicates that the market is overly optimistic on earnings recovery expectations. We need to look at a three-year forward multiple to see things more reasonably, where Intel is at 13.4x, roughly the same as AMD, while NVIDIA is at 16.2x, and other players like Broadcom at 18.3x, Qualcomm at 12.6x, and TSMC at 10x. [Alpha Spread] I expect Intel's multiple will get further compressed as the company continues to struggle with its foundry business and delays in launching its AI GPU product until at least next year. My thesis is that the stock will likely get worse before it gets better, because the new CEO isn't a miracle worker. For example, comparing to AMD, AMD is now cheaper than Intel, and AMD does not have to deal with the financial struggle of reorganizing its business. Advanced Micro Devices is selling at a leading profit multiple of 13.8x, which reflects a slight discount to Intel's present earnings multiple of 13.4x. In my view, AMD is a rock-solid chip play that has become too cheap recentlyan alternative way to allocate capital instead of investing in Intel, especially without any clarity on its foundry business. At the moment, Intel is expected to show the least revenue growth among peers like NVIDIA, AMD, and TSMC, and that isn't forecast to change anytime soon. Therefore, I find it hard to rationalize diverting capital to Intel over the other names. Additionally, if earnings estimates continue to be cut, the valuation will be pushed up exponentiallyas seen for 2025, a move closer to a flat line for non-GAAP EPS could put the P/E on expected earnings into the hundreds. [Alpha Spread] Looking at a DCF valuation, any upside momentum for Intel looks even bleaker. Based on Wall Street estimates, my DCF model suggests an intrinsic value of $21.74 per share, which represents a potential downside of about 5%. This model uses a rather optimistic discount rate of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 3%. Revenue projections in the DCF model forecast growth from $55 billion in Year 1 to $68 billion by Year 5, which is in line with Wall Street estimates. Additionally, net margins are expected to expand significantly, rising from 4% in Year 1 to 12% by the end of the forecast period. Even with these optimistic assumptions, the DCF model indicates an apparent downside for Intel. Honestly, I think Intel's recent run-up has already priced in most of the optimism around Tan's return. Yeah, the stock had been stuck below its average price target for most of the past year, but last week's rally changed that. As of March 28, Intel was sitting around its average valuation of $22.9. But let's not forgetjust a year ago, the average price target was in the mid-$40s, and three years ago, it was in the mid-$50s. That tells me analysts have been cutting their expectations for a while now. The broader semiconductor and tech sell-off has actually made valuations look more attractive across the boardMorningstar even says the tech sector is about 8% undervalued right now. So, with better opportunities popping up elsewhere, I think it makes sense to start reallocating away from Intel. The excitement around Tan is already baked into the price, and I don't see a strong enough reason to keep riding this wave. Big-name investors have been dumping Intel for a while now. Since mid-2022, guru sells have been outpacing buys, and some of the biggest names in the gameKen Fisher(Trades,Portfolio),Mario Gabelli(Trades,Portfolio), andChris Davis(Trades,Portfolio)have been cutting their stakes significantly. Fisher, for example, slashed his Intel holdings by about 77% as of late 2024 and shifted that capital into AMD, Nvidia, and Broadcomcompanies that, let's be honest, have a much clearer path in AI. That tells me that even the investors who once backed Intel as an AI play are jumping ship. Chris Davis(Trades,Portfolio) did the same thing, cutting his Intel position by almost 80%. But instead of going all-in on AI, he moved into Applied Materials (which has a much stronger outlook, in my opinion) and more traditional plays like CVS and REITsthink Hudson Pacific Properties and Rexford Industrial Realty. The way I see it, these guys aren't just rotating out of Intelthey're moving toward companies with better long-term potential and fewer question marks hanging over them. And honestly? That makes a lot of sense to me. In conclusion, I believe Intel is in a complete mess right now. The company is losing on multiple fronts and is clearly being crushed by its competitionsomething I really dislike when assessing an investment. While there is always the possibility of a 180 turnaround, I see absolutely no signs of that happening in the near term. Now that Intel has named a new CEO, I expect the company to finally get its act together, but investors need to see a concrete plan to turnaround this struggling business. Although Intel shares have held up somewhat amid overall market turbulence, true gains won't materialize until its financials improve meaningfully. Even though I appreciate Tan's background, I remain wary that a new CEO can immediately fix decades of strategic drift. Until Intel shows real, tangible improvements and carves out a competitive niche, I believe its risk/reward profile stays tilted to the downside.

Investors momentarilypoured back into Big Techafter the administration initiateda temporary levy exemptionthat covers consumer electronics, networking equipment, GPUs, and servers. It's essentially another way of saying that Big Tech will probably be OK, as investors alsolook to the sector as a defensive play. Meanwhile, other sectors and companies still stare down amassive tariff upheaval. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy It's a feature of American politics to want to avoid the appearance of picking winners and losers in the market. That phrase is often used as a rhetorical cudgel to attack opponents as bad for the economy. But one person's favoritism is another's industrial policy. If the market is consumed by the repercussions of tariffs, exemptions to those taxes can mean everything.The potential special carve-outs for tech, however, initially sparked a rally on Monday, fizzled, then rebounded. Part of this confused response from investors was the White Houseseemingly sending mixed signals. After the exclusions from reciprocal tariffs were first unveiled, the president said in a social media post ""there was no Tariff 'exception' announced."" He later told reporters that his goal was encouraging production to move to the US but added that the administration has to show flexibility. The tech titans hoping to receive assistance from the White House are showing flexibility too, or rathera willingness to support the president's agendaof bolstering domestic manufacturing and investment. Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday said it willproduce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructurein the US within the next four years. That announcement follows other Big Tech commitments from Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) to spend in the US. Recent trading sessions with wild upward swings have made one thing clear: Pronouncements on tariffs arethe only meaningful catalyst for stocksin this uncertain moment. That goes for Big Tech too, whose trillion-dollar tickers are buoyed by global supply chains and customer bases all around the world. It's true that their size and market heft might allow these companies to weather whatever tariff costs come. But people are intimately familiar with how much, say, a phone costs, making a sudden upcharge on a finished product an unsavory consumer experience. It is, perhaps, the modern price of bread. Overall, the dizzying tariff news, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients, is ""a step forward net positive for Apple as well as other tech names."" It creates the space for some sort of negotiation with China, he said, and can lead to a deescalation of the trade war issues that have left Big Tech caught in the middle. Their importance for American tech supremacy means, in a way, they are too important to fail, and the value they bring to the stock market makes the rest of the S&P seem like lesser moons in a solar system that revolves around them. But in this chaotic environment, the most important distinction of all isn't size alone; it's a tariff carve-out. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Here Are 2 Fantastic Stocks to Buy Right Now.";"If you've got some undeployed cash that you're looking to invest in the stock market, I've got two fantastic stocks that look like excellent buys. However, there is a disclaimer on these stocks: you'll need to hold them for at least three to five years to get the full benefit. The tailwinds in the industries that these two operate in are long-term trends. However, the stocks will be disrupted occasionally due to fears of how the economy is doing, President Donald Trump's tariff plans, or some other unknown issue that has yet to be uncovered. If you can keep that mindset, then I think thatNvidia(NVDA-0.18%)andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.90%)are top buys right now. If you've got $1,000 to invest, I can think of few better stock picks, and I believe that over that three- to five-year time frame, it's not unreasonable to expect your money to double. Both Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are at the center of a major technological shift: artificial intelligence (AI). AI has the power to transform how we do business and tasks in our daily lives and is likely the biggest innovation since the internet became widespread. This makes this trend a must-invest area, and focusing on suppliers is a great way to make a solid profit. TSMC and Nvidia make key components in the AI value stream and are making lots of money from the trend right now.Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs)are the computing muscle behind many of the AI models that are used today. These devices can process multiple calculations in parallel, making them more suited for arduous computing tasks like AI. Additionally, GPUs can be combined in clusters to further amplify that effect, which is why you'll hear about AI hyperscalers placing over 100,000 GPUs in a data center. Nvidia may design and combine components to produce a GPU, but it doesn't make the chips that go into them; that's where Taiwan Semiconductor shines. TSMC is a chip fabricator and takes designs from clients like Nvidia orAppleand produces them on their behalf. This is a great position because TSMC can sell to companies competing against each other, as it does with Nvidia andAdvanced Micro Devices. Although most of its chips are produced in Taiwan, which was a target of Trump's tariffs, it is working on expanding production in the U.S. However, semiconductors are specifically exempt from tariffs, so this isn't a concern right now -- but it could be at some point. Taiwan Semi recently announced a $100 billion investment in U.S. production facilities, which will include three fabrication facilities, two packaging facilities, and one research and development center. This announcement put TSMC in Trump's good graces, as the company is doing exactly what he wants: moving production capabilities within U.S. borders. The investment case for these two is strong, but what kind of growth can investors expect? Management teams for Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor have openly discussed their growth trajectories. Right now, Nvidia estimates that data center capital expenditures reached around $400 billion. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expects that figure to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia generated around $130 billion in revenue. So, if Nvidia could maintain its current revenue share of the build-out expenses (around 33%) and the projection comes true, Nvidia's revenue could double by 150% from now to 2028, when it would be producing $325 billion. Even if its market share slips to a quarter of total buildout spend, Nvidia's revenue would still nearly double in four years, which would be excellent news for shareholders. Taiwan Semiconductor's management sees a similar growth trajectory. Over the next five years, it expects AI-related revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45%. This boosts its overall growth rate, which management believes will be near 20%.

"2025-04-15 12:08:00";"The Zacks Analyst Blog Apple, NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon.com and Alphabet";"Chicago, IL ‚Äì April 15, 2025 ‚Äì Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Apple Inc AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.‚Äôs AMD, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL. With new tariffs being imposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese goods at the beginning of April,Apple IncandNVIDIA Corporationsaw their stocks decline. However, the latest tariff relief has been a blessing in disguise for these tech behemoths, helping them prevent higher import costs and product price rises. This has prompted speculation on which stock to invest in. Let‚Äôs explore ‚Äì President Trump‚Äôs steep tariffs on goods produced and imported from China could have disrupted Apple‚Äôs supply chains as severely as during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Apple breathed a sigh of relief after the Trump administration exempted electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs. Before the tariff exemption, Apple planned to increase iPhone production in India, which is subject to lower levies, while also securing its supply chain. Apple intends to produce over 30 million iPhones in India, satisfying a significant portion of American demand, which constitutes a third of global demand. However, Apple is manufacturing its upcoming iPhone 17 in China, which will be launched soon. Shifting the production base to India or another location in a short time will require a herculean effort. It may also lead to retaliation from China, which has set up inquiries into U.S. companies and may create difficulties for Apple through its customs processes. A complete breakup from China would be improbable as Apple produces the bulk of its iPhones in China, and there is a dearth of required skills to manufacture iPhones in the United States at the moment. Instead, Apple argued that the United States should boost semiconductor production and revive high-value job opportunities. However, the tariff relief is temporary, and if no breakthrough occurs soon, it may impact Apple‚Äôs near-term profitability. President Trump said that relying on China for vital tech goods like smartphones and semiconductors isn‚Äôt acceptable. If tariffs are imposed, iPhone prices will rise, impacting American consumers and Apple‚Äôs sales volume. Anyhow, some tariffs still apply to goods imported from China and there may be sectoral tariffs on goods that have semiconductors, which can further affect Apple‚Äôs stagnating revenues. Given the supply-chain risks, stagnant revenues and tariff uncertainties, Apple isn‚Äôt a favorable stock choice currently. Moreover, according to the price/earnings (P/E) ratio, Apple stock trades at 27.4X forward earnings. In comparison, the Computer - Micro Computers industry‚Äôs forward earnings multiple is 26.05. The Apple stock, therefore, is overvalued and may plummet if tariff issues remain unresolved. Like Apple, NVIDIA too got a momentary relief from Trump‚Äôs tariffs. This is because certain critical chips used by NVIDIA and produced in China were exempted. Now, there is a 90-day pause in tariffs, but the outcome depends on how the negotiations between the United States and its trade partners unfold. So, an element of ambiguity persists. However, NVIDIA remains the preferred stock to buy during these times of distress. With graphic processing units (GPUs) continuing to gain popularity at a breakneck speed and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending increasing, NVIDIA‚Äôs long-term future looks brighter. Lest we forget, Apple faces tough competition across all segments, economic challenges, and regulatory hazards, affecting its long-term outlook. Coming back to NVIDIA, the company is experiencing high demand for new Blackwell and older Hopper chips because of their superior AI interfaces compared to competitors. The company‚Äôs CUDA software platform is in more demand among developers thanAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.‚Äôs ROCm software platform. Major cloud computing companies likeAmazon.com, Inc.andAlphabet Inc.are also spending billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure, which could benefit NVIDIA (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy?). NVIDIA stock is currently more affordable than its competitors, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.18 compared to the Semiconductor - General industry‚Äôs 28.4X forward earnings multiple. This leads to NVIDIA having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, whereas Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today‚Äôs Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.

"2025-04-15 14:08:43";"Is NVIDIA (NVDA) the Best Machine Learning Stock to Buy Now?";"We recently published a list of the10 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other machine-learning stocks. Grand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It‚Äôs now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms. On April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄòSquawk Box‚Äô to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there‚Äôs a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek‚Äôs introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward. Jassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors. We sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024.

However, as larger tech companies try to make their own AI chips now, NVIDIA Corp.‚Äôs (NASDAQ:NVDA) market shares are threatened. It‚Äôs also facing increased competition with major tech players like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD. For instance, the company heavily relies on the 3nm process nodes that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes.

It stated the following in its Q4 2024investor letter: ‚ÄúFor a second year running,NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund‚Äôs top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia‚Äôs ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia‚Äôs extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to ‚Äúinference‚Äù (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia‚Äôs financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia‚Äôs data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia‚Äôs technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia‚Äôs valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 5thon our list of the best machine learning stocks to buy now.
