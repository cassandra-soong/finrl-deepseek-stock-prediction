        "content": "The stock market has gotten off to a rocky start this year, but market volatility is a small price to pay for the large gains of holding shares of a great business over many years. If you put your money in the right growth stocks, you can build wealth that lasts for generations. Consider thatCoca-Colahas been around since 1886, yet its stock is still hitting new highs in 2025. If you have $2,000 extra cash you don't need for other life priorities, putting that cash to work in shares of leadingartificial intelligence (AI)companies could be very rewarding over the next decade and beyond. The following AI stocks would make solid additions to a well-rounded portfolio of growth investments. Companies are in the process of investing substantial sums in AI.ServiceNow(NOW0.74%)is a leader provider of AI software that helps businesses streamline workflows and increase operating efficiency. It is used by leading companies, including the U.S. government, and it continues to see strong demand. The company just announced another quarter of strong growth that has the stock moving higher. ServiceNow's subscription revenue grew 19% year-over-year in Q1, exceeding expectations. Wall Street was fearful that uncertainty in the economy would weigh on near-term investment in software, but ServiceNow's momentum isn't slowing. It closed 72 deals over $1 million in net new annual contract value. It is positioning to be a leader in agentic AI. AI agents are super-intelligent assistants that can take a request by the user and complete a series of tasks to solve a problem. Demand for advanced AI features drove a 150% year-over-year increase in the number of deals for ServiceNow's Pro Plus AI offerings last quarter. ServiceNow also seems well positioned to benefit from potential new deals in its federal government business, where it has more than 1,700 federal and public sector customers. The Trump administration's goal to increase government efficiency certainly plays to ServiceNow's capabilities.Its U.S. public sector revenue grew over 30% year-over-year in Q1, including one new customer in the federal government. What's clear is that ServiceNow is emerging as a go-to solution for leading organizations wanting to use AI to improve productivity and modernize operations. The need to reduce costs and improve efficiency is becoming more urgent than ever. As each company adopts AI solutions, it leads to a domino effect where other companies are basically forced to adopt similar solutions to stay competitive. This is fueling ServiceNow's momentum. The stock popped 23% following its Q1 earnings results, but it's still trading more than 30% from its recent highs. Investors could split their $2,000 and buy one share of ServiceNow. Analysts are projecting the company'searningsto grow at an annualized rate of 30%, which could fuel handsome gains for investors over the next several years. The demand for AI software also fuels growth for leading suppliers of advanced computing chips. Training applications to solve problems without human input requires substantial investment in graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI training, andNvidia's(NVDA4.11%)GPUs are the gold standard. Nvidia has been the leader in GPUs for many years. As the leading supplier of very pricey chips, it is a highly profitable business, with $73 billion in trailing-12-month net income. It has growing resources to invest in innovation to remain the leader for years to come. Nvidia's chips were the popular choice the past few years that helped train the AI for OpenAI's ChatGPT and other popular AI models. Cloud giants likeAmazonWeb Services and Google Cloud are some of Nvidia's top customers. Nvidia's new Blackwell chips are in high demand, with analysts expecting the company's revenue to increase 55% to $201 billion this year. Annual spending ondata centerinfrastructure, which is Nvidia's largest addressable market, is expected to reach $1 trillion in the coming years, according to Dell'Oro Group. But CEO Jensen Huang believes that the market for GPU-based computing systems could be hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars. That's based on the idea that every company and industry will one day run on AI. Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to grow more than 35% per year over the next several years. Yet investors can currently buy the shares for 22 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. That's modest for a company growing at these rates. Investors who split their money between ServiceNow andNvidiawill own shares of two dominant AI companies on the software and hardware side and will be in a great position to profit from the growth of AI.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)has been taking a beating so far this year. Shares have plunged nearly 30% year to date as of this writing. Yet the stock is stillhigherby more than 27% over the past 12 months. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader remains one of thelargest companies by market cap, valued at about $2.4 trillion. The question for investors is whether Nvidia stock can regain its momentum and return the company to a valuation of $3 trillion or beyond. I believe it can, and I think one key date to watch is coming up on May 1. The decline in Nvidia shares in recent months has had several forces behind it. Most obvious was the stock's more than 800% return over the two-year period ending Dec. 31, 2024. It's natural for some investors to want to protect those gains. Trying to time stock prices can be hazardous to one's financial health, though. Long-term investments are better left untouched if the company's underlying business prospects remain strong. That brings us to another headwind for Nvidia stock. Uncertainty related to tariffs and general demand for AI infrastructure. The company was recently forced to take a $5.5 billion charge as the U.S. government placed indefinite restrictions on its H20 chip sales to China. Those chips were specifically designed for the Chinese market, and that business will inevitably be filled by other, potentially domestic, Chinesechip suppliers. Image source: Getty Images. While China sales are important for Nvidia, they only represented about 13% of total revenue in fiscal year 2025. More critical is the trajectory of demand for its AI products frommajor tech companieslikeMicrosoft,Amazon, and others. That is also now coming into question. Recent reports have reiterated aWells Fargoanalyst note saying that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has delayed prior plans fornew data center leases. Microsoft, another large cloud infrastructure provider, has made similar decisions to slow data center expansion, according to the analysts. That comes after plans to aggressively expand cloud infrastructure capacity with hundreds of billions of dollars in capital spending for Nvidia'sGPU hardwarehad been announced by several companies. Others, including xAI andMeta, appear to be continuing with growth plans. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had previously toldCNBCthat he didn't expect to cut back on capital spending for data center compute capacity. That's why investors need to mark May 1 on their calendars. Amazon is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on that date. Microsoft will be providing its quarterly update the day prior. Amazon AWS vice president of global data centers Kevin Miller called any modification in plans \"routine capacity management.\" If the companies reiterate that capital spending plans are basically on track, investors could pour back into Nvidia stock after its recent plunge. Nvidia'sprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratiois now near a three-year low based on current fiscal year earnings estimates.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts The long-term growth of AI doesn't look to be hitting a wall. Enterprises, as well as consumers, should increase use. And Nvidia isn't just making money on AI hardware. It has robust software architecture offerings that companies are buying. It also has a fast-growing robotics and assisted driving segment. Business spending could fluctuate. An economic slowdown or even recession could delay the pace of AI expansion. In the end, though, Nvidia remains the sector leader. I suspect long-term investors will look back on its recent stock price as a fine investment opportunity.",

        "header": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Since the beginning of 2023,Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)has added more than $2.2 trillion to its market capitalization on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Demand is through the roof for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the gold standard for developing AI models. Nvidia's customers include some of the world's biggest technology companies, which are battling for AI supremacy, includingMicrosoft,Amazon,Meta Platforms, andAlphabet.These four companies are forecast to spend a record amount of money on data center infrastructure during 2025. But according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, that spending will increase significantly every year for the foreseeable future, and cross an important milestone in 2028. The company continues to launch new chips to maintain its edge over the competition, so here's where its stock could be in three years. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia's H100 data centerGPUdominated the industry in 2023 and for most of 2024. It was based on the company's Hopper architecture, which has since been superseded by Blackwell and, more recently, Blackwell Ultra. The upcoming Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU can deliver up to 50 times more performance than the H100 in certain configurations, because it was designed for next-generationAI models, which are capable of \"reasoning.\" In the past, chatbots likeOpenAI'sChatGPT would quickly render one-shot responses to users' queries, which made them convenient, but they occasionally blurted out inaccurate information. Reasoning models spend more time thinking and correcting potential errors in the background in order to deliver more polished responses. While this is a great step forward for the AI industry, it does create some new challenges. Huang says reasoning models require a staggering 100 times more computing power than their predecessors for two reasons. First, they consume 10 times more tokens than traditionallarge language models(LLMs) because of all the thinking that goes on in the background. Second, they are much slower to render responses, which means GPUs need to be up to 10 times more powerful to offset the delays, or else AI will lose the convenience factor that people have grown to love. That's why new chips based on the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra architectures are in such high demand. The four Nvidia customers I mentioned at the top -- Microsoft,Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet -- have told investors they plan to spend over $300 billion (combined) on data center infrastructure and chips this year, which would be a record. That doesn't include other big spenders like OpenAI,Tesla, orOracle. But Huang thinks this is just the beginning, because three years from now in 2028, he predicts data center spending will top $1 trillion annually, which would be a monumental tailwind for Nvidia's business. Nvidia generated a record $130.5 billion in totalrevenueduring its fiscal year 2025 (which ended Jan. 26). The data center segment accounted for $115.2 billion of that figure, which represented a whopping 142% increase from the prior year, highlighting how quickly GPU demand is growing. Nvidia's soaring top line also drove a significant increase in profits, with the company'searnings per share(EPS) soaring by 130% to $2.99 in fiscal 2025. That places its stock at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof just 36, which is a 39% discount to its 10-year average of 59.6. But the stock looks even cheaper on a forward basis. Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Nvidia will deliver $4.42 in EPS during the current fiscal year 2026, placing its stock at aforward P/E ratioof 23.9: NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts. In other words, Nvidia stock would have to soar by around 149% over the next 12 months just to trade in line with its 10-year average P/E ratio of 59.6, implying a price of $263 per share. But even if its P/E ratio remains at 36 instead, the stock could still top $200 in fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027) based on Wall Street's earnings forecast for that year. Therefore, as long as Nvidia maintainssomeannual earnings growth after that, its stock should be trading well beyond $200 in calendar year 2028. Considering that's the year Huang is forecasting $1 trillion in data center spending, the company should have no problem generating more earnings. The reason Nvidia's P/E ratio looks so attractive right now is because its stock is down 29% from its all-time high amid thesimmering global trade tensions, which threaten to dampen economic growth in the near term. Some of Nvidia's top customers might be forced to temporarily pull back on their data center investments if they suffer a slowdown in their core businesses, which would reduce demand for GPUs and dent the company's earnings potential. However, AI is shaping up to be a long-term boom, and the industry can't move forward without the hardware supplied by companies like Nvidia. Therefore, investors who buy Nvidia stock todaymight have to weather some volatilitywhile the U.S. negotiates new trade deals with other countries, but they could do extremely well if they put the short-term noise aside and stay focused on the years ahead.",

        "header": "Prediction: This Stock Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Two companies have sat at or near the top of the list of the world's most valuable companies for the better part of a decade:Apple(AAPL0.41%)andMicrosoft(MSFT1.21%). The longtime tech giants were recently joined at the top of the list byNvidia(NVDA4.11%), which has skyrocketed in value as demand for its market-leading GPUs soared. All three of these companies have, at one time or another, surpassed a market valuation of $3 trillion, although Apple is the only one hanging onto that milestone at the moment. Meanwhile, there's a clear gap between the three giants in the market and the next group of mega-cap stocks. But there's one company that could join and even surpass Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple's valuation over the next five years, and its stock looks like an incredible value right now. Image source: Getty Images. The appeal of a company like Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia, which have come to completely dominate certain markets like smartphones, PC operating systems and enterprise productivity software, andGPUsis clear. But a company that dominates multiple industries can be even more appealing. Especially if those industries have strong growth potential. That's whyAmazon(AMZN1.35%)looks like such a great opportunity for investors right now. Amazon holds a dominant position ine-commerce. It's the market leader incloud computing. It's one of the largest digital advertising channels, and it's growing quickly. And it has several additional growth opportunities ahead. Amazon got to this point by being willing to sacrifice in the short-term for long-term potential gain. And that gain started to come to fruition in the last few years. That's evidenced by its massive free cash flow growth and expanding operating margin. Amazon set new records for both in 2024, generating $32.9 billion in free cash flow with a 10.75% operating margin. Importantly, Amazon has seen improvements in profitability across all of its businesses. North American retail saw its operating margin expand to 6.4% last year from 4.2% last year. Its international segment turned positive last year as well, generating operating margin of 2.7% versus -2% in 2023. And Amazon Web Services generated a massive operating margin of 37% in 2024 versus 27% in 2023. That margin expansion should continue in 2025. Amazon spent the last two years revamping its logistics network in the United States to reduce costs and improve delivery times. It's gone from a heavy investment cycle and it's now capitalizing on that investment with improved profitability. Amazon's high-margin advertising business is also wrapped up in its retail business. That's poised to grow quickly as it expands advertising inventory with more video ads in Prime Video and its marketplace. Meanwhile, Amazon has committed to spending heavily on Amazon Web Services in 2025 to meet the growing demand for AI services. But its spending ahead of forecasted demand. Management said it remained capacity constrained in 2024, so it expects significant revenue growth in 2025 as it builds out more data centers for AWS. Despite the massive spending on AWS, the improved profitability should produce continued growth in free cash flow over time. Amazon has never been afraid to expand into new opportunities when it sees them. And there are two big opportunities where the company can leverage its massive infrastructure to provide services few others can compete with. The first big opportunity is in the continued growth of artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon can benefit not just from a raw compute perspective, but from additional services that can help enterprises make the most oflarge language models. It introduced Amazon Bedrock to help customers leverage the foundation models of others, customized with a customers' own data, to build new AI applications. Its also building its own AI applications for consumers, and providing frameworks for businesses to easily develop their own applications or internal AI agents. This likely is still the early innings of AI development, and Amazon is positioned to be one of the big winners from continued growth. The other opportunity is in logistics. Amazon has built an extensive network of fulfillment centers and warehouses throughout the country. Amazon shipped more packages than any other carrier in the United States in 2022. As mentioned it recently revamped its system to maximize the efficiency of the massive network. Amazon offers limited services for merchants outside of its marketplace, but it could launch its own logistics service for third parties in the future, andits a big opportunity. Considering Amazon could mostly leverage existing infrastructure and systems, the incremental profits from logistics services could be another major growth lever for the business. With multiple leading positions in several fast-growing markets and new opportunities ahead, it may be only a matter of time before Amazon overtakes Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock currently looks relatively undervalued. Its forward PE sits around 29.5 as of this writing. While that's higher than the three biggest companies in the market, it's relatively low for Amazon. That's especially true if youcompare Amazon to other retailers right nowor its historic PE ratio. Moreover, Amazon is charting a path to grow its free cash flow significantly over the next few years as AWS scales and its retail operations become more profitable. By 2030, the company could easily surpass $100 billion in annual free cash flow. (It's worth noting, analysts previously thought Amazon would reach that level by next year, but Amazon's plans to spend $100 billion on capex this year and greater economic uncertainty have reduced those estimates.) With a 2% free cash flow yield, that would put its valuation at $5 trillion, a 2.5% yield would put it at $4 trillion. Even if Amazon doesn't overtake Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple by then, that still presents an appealing opportunity with a current market valuation less than $2 trillion.",

        "content": "Even though the market has slightly recovered from the lows it experienced not long ago, it's still well off its all-time highs. Despite this, there are plenty of bargains to be found in the market. Two that I'm most excited about areTaiwan Semiconductor(TSM0.57%)andThe Trade Desk(TTD1.33%). Although they operate in completely different industries, they will be OK over the long term. Taiwan Semi is the leading contract chip manufacturer and has contracts with many of the largest tech companies around the globe. Companies likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)andNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)don't have chip production capabilities; they just handle end assembly of their chips. Instead, they source their chips from Taiwan Semi, which acts as a fabrication facility. While there may be some concerns with TSMC's geographical location outside the U.S. andpotential exposure to tariffs, there are no tariffs on semiconductors right now. However, the Trump administration has stated that one will come soon. Taiwan Semiconductor is already taking steps to sidestep these tariffs by building facilities in the U.S. In addition to the $65 billion facility already built in Arizona, Taiwan Semi announced a $100 billion investment to stand up six new facilities in the U.S. However, those facilities will take some time, which leaves TSMC on the hook if semiconductor tariffs are eventually implemented. However, the fear of tariffs didn't stop Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO from stating: We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies. However, we have not seen any change in our customers' behavior so far. Therefore, we continue to expect our full year 2025 revenue to increase by close to mid-20s percent in U.S. dollar terms. That's bullish news for investors, yet the stock has barely budged after that announcement.  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At 17 times forward earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is a steal at these levels, and investors should use this market-wide weakness as their opportunity to scoop up the top player in the chip production industry. The market is valuing TSMC's stock like it will lose substantial business, yet management is stating the exact opposite. The Trade Desk has been hit by two sell-offs in 2025: one from the broader market and the other from a bad earnings report. In the fourth quarter, The Trade Desk missed revenue expectations for the first time in company history, which caused the stock to sell off by more than 30% the next day. This occurred in mid-February, which was right before the broader market sell-off began. These two events compounded each other, which is why The Trade Desk's stock is down around 65% from its all-time high. However, this is a very shortsighted reaction. The Trade Desk is one of the most dominant companies in the digital advertising space. It helps ad buyers (those with a product or service to sell) find the most opportune spaces to place their ads on the Internet. This can range from the margins of a website to connected TV to podcast ads. Targeted ads are the most effective form of advertising, and using AI to power that feature is key to success. The Trade Desk has been urging clients to migrate from its old offering to the new AI-powered platform, and the company largely wrapped up that process in Q4. This is what caused the revenue miss, as The Trade Desk prioritized long-term customer relationships rather than short-term revenue. This will pay off over the next few years, but the market really only cares about the next few months. The digital media space still has a massive growth runway, and The Trade Desk is primed to benefit from this migration. But after the sell-off, all the optimism in The Trade Desk's stock seems gone.  TTD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Thought 28 times forward earnings may not seem like a bargain compared to other stocks in the market (like Taiwan Semiconductor), the company's dominance in this growing industry can't be ignored. As a result, I think investors should be taking advantage of themarket's sale price on The Trade Desk's stock.",

        "content": "Pinpointing strong bargains in the stock market is key to success, and the market is full of them right now. While some may be concerned about tariff effects in the short term, most of these stocks have incredibly bright long-term outlooks. By shifting your focus from the next few months to the next few years, you can ignore some of today's events, and it will be obvious which stocks are great buys now. Three companies that are down more than 30% from their all-time highs and look like excellent buys areNvidia(NVDA4.11%),Taiwan Semiconductor(TSM0.57%), andASML(ASML0.38%). These three also represent a great picture of the AI chip value chain, and as long as AI continues to be an area where businesses invest, these three will succeed. As a quick overview of the supply chain, Nvidia places Taiwan Semiconductor's chips in itsGPUs (graphics processing units), which have been the primary computing unit deployed by the AI hyperscalers. To make these chips, Taiwan Semiconductor needs specialized machines from ASML known as extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography machines. No company in the world has EUV technology besides ASML, so its engineering dominance has earned it a technological monopoly. As the demand for Nvidia GPUs rises, so does the need for more Taiwan Semi chips. Increased chip demand requires more production capacity, which means more ASML EUV machines. Again, this requires AI demand to continue rising, which seems to be the way that it's heading. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated at its 2025 GTC event that data center buildouts will increase from about $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. Considering that Nvidia's trailing 12-month total data center revenue was $115 billion, it gets nearly a third of all data center spending. That's a huge chunk of the market, and if Nvidia can maintain that percentage, it will deliver monster growth over the next few years. This also jives with what Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO, C.C. Wei, has been saying. For 2025, they expect revenue from their AI-related chips to double. Additionally, over the next five years, they expect AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compounded annual growth rate, which would be an incredible achievement. While investors can speculate whether these projections are valid, the reality is that these two CEOs are better connected to the demand than almost anybody else. While they can still make mistakes, the odds of getting this information completely wrong are unlikely. As a result, investors need to take refuge in the fact that there is still a massive AI buildout going on, and this trend will be unlikely to be disrupted over the next five years unless a severe economic collapse occurs. I don't think that's likely, which makes these three stocks intriguing considering their sale prices. While these stocks used to be highly valued, they aren't that way anymore following the sell-off.  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts ASML is the most expensive stock on the list at 24.4 times forward earnings, but those projections don't include ASML's recently announced plan to repurchase up to 10% of its stock. This could be a huge boost for the stock, making it even cheaper than it currently appears. Nvidia at 23 times forward earnings is a no-brainer, as the growth it's expected to achieve over the next few years is quite impressive. Lastly, Taiwan Semiconductor is a steal at these levels because the broader market (as measured by theS&P 500(^GSPC0.74%)) trades for 19.8 times forward earnings. TSMC is expecting market-beating growth over the next five years, so buying it at a discount to the market is a great investment opportunity. These three may be hurting, but the long-term outlook is still clear. All three of these stocks look like excellent bargains, andinvestors should scoop them up while they're still cheap.",

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) is slated to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market closes Wednesday, with analysts overwhelmingly bullish on the tech giant's stock. All of the 20 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have issued \u201cbuy\u201d or equivalent ratings for the stock, which has lost 7% so far in 2025. Their consensus price target slightly above $492 would suggest over 25% upside from Friday\u2019s closing price of $391.85. Wedbush analysts recently lowered their price target to $475 from $550 amid worries aboutPresident Trump's tariffs, but said they \"remain long term bullish\" on Microsoft, pointing to its AI potential. \"It has become crystal clear to us that the monetization opportunities around deploying AI in the cloud is a transformational opportunity across the industry with Redmond remaining in the driver's seat,\" they said. Goldman Sachs analysts, who similarly maintained a \"buy\" rating for Microsoft but lowered their price target to $450 from $500, said the current economic environment has created a \"wide range of different outcomes,\" but that they believe Microsoft could be \"well positioned to capitalize\" on AI opportunities. Morningstar analystssaidMicrosoft could also be in a stronger position than many other tech companies, because it \"has minimal risk exposure to retail, advertising spending, cyclical hardware, or physical supply chains.\" Analysts polled by Visible Alpha on average expect Microsoft to report third-quarter revenue of $68.44 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year, and net income of $23.94 billion, or $3.21 per share, compared to $21.94 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier. Revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure cloud computing platform, is expected to jump 18% to $26.13 billion.",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the12 AI Stocks Analysts Are Talking About Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Latest reports from the IMF reveal that economic gains from artificial intelligence are likely to outweigh the costs of rising carbon emissions from the data centers needed to run AI models. The report, released at the IMF\u2019s annual spring meeting in Washington, revealed how artificial intelligence is going to boost global output by around 0.5% a year between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, it also noted how these output gains will not be shared equally worldwide. READ NOW:Top 10 AI Stocks Making Headlines TodayandTop 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week \"Despite challenges related to higher electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions, the gains to global GDP from AI are likely to outweigh the cost of the additional emissions. The social cost of these extra emissions is minor compared with the expected economic gains from AI, yet it still adds to the worrisome buildup of emissions\u201d. Considering that energy policies remain the same and artificial intelligence use becomes widespread, greenhouse gas emissions will see a cumulative global increase of 1.2% between 2025 and 2030. However, a switch to greener energy policies would limit the increase to 1.3 Gt. Quantifying the social cost of these emissions, the report calculated that the extra cost is likely to be at $50.7-$66.3 billion, which is smaller than the income gains that can help boost the economy by 0.5% each year through AI. According to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, AI may even be able to generate an overall reduction in carbon emissions if it accelerates advances in low-carbon technologies in the power, food, and transport sectors. \"But market forces alone are unlikely to successfully drive AI's application toward climate action. Governments, tech companies and energy companies must play an active role in ensuring AI is used intentionally, equitably and sustainably.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The last time Big Tech delivered earnings, Donald Trump had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors\u2019 main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits. Most Read from Bloomberg Why Car YouTuber Matt Farah Is Fighting for Walkable Cities Newsom Says California Is Now the World\u2019s Fourth-Biggest Economy At Bryn Mawr, a Monumental Plaza Traces the Steps of Black History Backyard Micro-Flats Aim to Ease South Africa\u2019s Housing Crisis Los Angeles Downgraded to AA- by S&P Due to Budget Woes Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture. This week\u2019s quarterly results from Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that\u2019s wiped $5.5 trillion from the S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap. Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn\u2019t giving the companies\u2019 estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. \u2014 to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that\u2019s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions. That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks\u2019 share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster fears of muted corporate spending ahead. \u201cAny modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,\u201d said Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year\u2019s weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity. Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its worst quarter in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive Elon Musk intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet beat expectations but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 index jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it\u2019s still down 15% in 2025. Profits and Spending A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams. Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders \u2014 Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta \u2014 are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft\u2019s sudden decision to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures. Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. That said, there\u2019s little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty. American Airlines Group Inc. and Skechers USA Inc. are among companies that have abandoned forecasts this quarter. Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters. \u201cI think the more experienced management aren\u2019t even going to try,\u201d he said. A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants\u2019 dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies \u2014 even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trump said a deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs he\u2019s posted on Chinese goods. But for Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, it all comes down to the denominator in the price-to-earnings ratio. \u201cThe valuations are getting more interesting down here, but we haven\u2019t pulled the trigger yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of questions on the E-side of the equation.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek As More Women Lift Weights, Gyms Might Never Be the Same Why US Men Think College Isn\u2019t Worth It Anymore Eight Charts Show Men Are Falling Behind, From Classrooms to Careers The Mastermind of the Yellowstone Universe Isn\u2019t Done Yet Healthy Sodas Like Poppi, Olipop Are Drawing PepsiCo\u2019s and Coca-Cola\u2019s Attention \u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The Chinese company hopes that the latest iteration of its Ascend AI processors will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, and is slated to receive the first batch of samples of the processor as early as late May, the report added.

Seeking to limit China's technological development, particularly advances for its military, Washington has cut China off from Nvidia's most advanced AI products, including its flagship B200 chip.
