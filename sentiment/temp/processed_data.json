        "header": "Why Every Investor Should Consider the S&P 500 for Portfolio Diversification",
        "content": "Diversification is a pillar of sound investing, with portfolios including a range of stocks, bonds, and collections of investments such asexchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds. One of the most popular types of ETFs and index funds tracks the S&P 500 Index, which focuses on approximately 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies, and covers approximately 80% of availablemarket capitalization, per S&P Global. For this reason, investing in the S&P 500 can help balance the investment risk in your portfolio. Because the index includes companies from all sectors of the economy, risk is spread across a broad swath of industries, and you\u2019re less vulnerable to the failure of any single stock. Think of thelargest companies in the worldat the moment: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The stocks of all these companies are included in the S&P 500 Index, along with hundreds of the world\u2019s other most valued companies, and hold significant weight in its value. (Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple each make up more than 6% of the S&P 500, according to Slickcharts.) Tesla had recently been a member of this elite group, dubbed theMagnificent Seven, but was displaced by Broadcom as of this year. \u201cThe S&P 500 is the largest 500 firms in the US that are traded on the stock exchanges, and it is well diversified in the sense that it covers all different sectors\u2014utilities, manufacturing, financial, etc.,\u201d saidAnoop Rai, a professor of finance at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. \u201cThe key thing to note is if you have money in a diversified portfolio, your chances of losing are very low. Yes, you will have ups and downs, but since 1925, it has constantly gone up.\u201d Tim Urbanowicz, chief investment strategist atInnovator ETFs, said that the S&P 500 \u201cprovides the growth that investors are looking for\u201d and is \u201cvery hard to outperform\u201d because it provides exposure to a wide range of companies across various sectors, focusing on their market capitalization. \u201cThe thought process there is the more cash flow they have, the more fundamental value they have, the more exposure that you are getting to those specific companies,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, by owning a basket of 500 stocks, if some do well, others do poorly, at the end of the day, you're in essence reducing the impact of the risk of some of those losses.\u201d To compare, let\u2019s say you invest $1,000 in the S&P 500 and another $1,000 in a stock of your choice. When you\u2019re investing in a single stock, you\u2019re speculating that the company will perform well in the future. If it doesn\u2019t, you own all the losses. With the S&P 500, those losses would likely be balanced out by stocks in the index that are performing well. Still, some experts argue that a handful of companies dominating the index makes it less reflective of the broader market's performance and leaves people open to risk. While holding the S&P 500 has many advantages, namely that it brings balance to a portfolio, there are potential downsides as well. The makeup of the S&P 500 is based on market capitalization, but the index also uses these numbers to determine how much value each stock has overall in the index. Due to the enormous value of the companies in the Magnificent Seven, they hold significant weight\u2014about a third\u2014in the S&P 500 Index. \u201cIt is on the higher end of what we've seen historically,\u201d Urbanowicz said. \u201cTypically, you don't have that type of concentration at the top.\u201d Because of the heavy presence of the Magnificent Seven in the S&P 500, a small number of companies can have a disproportionate impact on the index's performance. If these companies have a bad quarter, it could drag the value of the entire index down. That raises the question of whether investors are truly getting the exposure to a wide range of companies that the index promises. Both Urbanowicz and Rai downplayed these potential downsides, however. Urbanowicz took issue with the fact that the Magnificent Seven isn\u2019t seen as diverse because they are mostly tech companies, arguing that each has a wide array of businesses. Amazon, for example, is known as an ecommerce platform, but also runs Amazon Web Services, a web hosting company, as well as physical retail and a film and TV production arm. \u201cThese are much different companies than we saw 20, 30 years ago, with many different business units internally. That, in essence, helps you diversify some of that risk as well,\u201d he said. Rai said that the S&P 500 still does offer investors diversification, despite this \u201cnew phenomenon\u201d of a small group of companies dominating its value. \u201cMaybe the beneficial effects have slightly been reduced, but overall, to me, it's the gold standard in terms of holding a well-diversified stock,\u201d he said. With a diverse range of company stocks dominated by the largest companies in the world, investing in the S&P 500 can be a savvy move. But it shouldn\u2019t be your only investment, according to experts, including Rai and Urbanowicz. One reason is that the index could succumb to losses, which could heavily impact people on the verge of retirement or retirees relying on their portfolios for income. \u201cThere's always the chance of a world war or a major COVID-type incident that will last,\u201d Rai said, adding that people approaching retirement or current retirees should also have bonds in their portfolio due to their stability. On the other hand, strictly investing in the S&P 500 will also preclude you from gaining a lot of value from the market. Your portfolio\u2019s value will increase significantly more if you hold Microsoft directly, as opposed to the exposure you get to the tech giant\u2019s stock in the S&P 500 index. \u201cIt cuts both ways,\u201d Urbanowicz said. To learn more about investing in the S&P 500, check outour complete guide. There are many options when it comes toalternative investmentsthat can complement the S&P 500 in a portfolio. One of note is theequal-weight S&P 500.As opposed to the market-weighted index, this index spreads your money across the entire S&P 500, as its name suggests. That means you have just as much exposure to the Tinder-owner Match Group as you do to Apple. \u201cIt's really giving you, in one sense, more diversification,\u201d Urbanowicz said. \u201cYou're spreading the risk and rewards around those same 500 stocks, but you're just owning more of them.\u201d Experienced investors often diversify their portfolios with stocks beyond the largest companies, looking to international indexes, emerging market stocks, and mid-cap stocks (companies with market capitalizations between $2 billion and $10 billion) for their potential growth and/or stability. Beyond stocks and bonds, there are non-U.S. equities, credit products, and other diversifying assets, including foreign currencies. The wider you go with the types of assets you invest in, the common wisdom says, the lower the risk. Therule statesthat one stock should not make up more than 5% of the investor's overall portfolio. Typically,experts recommendyou take on more risky assets when you\u2019re young and building wealth, and as you approach your 60s, you take a more conservative approach and focus on generating income. The Oracle of Omaha isquoted as saying, \u201cYou know, we think diversification is\u2014as practiced generally\u2014makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they\u2019re doing \u2026 it is a protection against ignorance.\u201d Now, Buffett isn\u2019t saying you shouldn\u2019t have a diverse portfolio, just that investors should do their homework and understand what they\u2019re investing in. The S&P 500 is an index that provides exposure to the 500 biggest companies by market cap, weighted toward the largest, including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple. Due to this, investing in the index could bring diversity to a portfolio, but solely relying on it is riskier than you may think. Investors should hold more and different types of assets to truly enjoy the benefits of a diverse portfolio.",

        "header": "Dollar-Cost Averaging Into the S&P 500: Does It Really Work?",
        "content": "Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) attempts to mitigate the emotional aspect of investing by taking some of the choice of when and how much to invest in a particular security out of the hands of the investor. With DCA, investors pick a target security and invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of what the price of that security is at any given time. DCA is a tool to limit risk. While DCA can work for any security, many investors apply this technique to an investment in the S&P 500 Index, a broad collection of around 500 large-cap U.S. companies collectively representing about 80% of total market capitalization. The function of DCA as an investment strategy is that it ensures investors do not try to \u201ctime the market\u201d by investing at times that seem opportune (such as when the price of a security is low, or in the midst of a rally). Investors may specify a particular target security and a total amount of money that they would like to invest; they then divide that sum into equal portions to be invested at regular intervals. Even the most experienced investors are subject to psychological traps such as the disposition effect, in which an investor tends to hold on to losing investments too long and sell winning investments too soon. DCA eliminates the possibility of investing based on emotional or psychological cues. With DCA, investors can avoid trying to time the market and reduce their overall investment risk. Because it is not possible to invest in the S&P 500 Index directly, an investor looking to apply DCA to the S&P 500 must first select an index or exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking this collection of stocks. Fortunately, these funds are plentiful and often quite inexpensive and include major players like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) or the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX). To implement a DCA strategy with one of these funds, an investor may first want to decide how much to invest in total, what the total timeframe for the investment will be, and how often to contribute to the investment. Say you wish to invest $10,000 in the SPY over a period of 10 months, with one investment on the first day of each month. You would then invest $1,000 each month, regardless of the price of SPY on that day. An advantage of using a broad-based S&P 500 fund like SPY is that it captures a wide swath of the market. Because it is already diversified, it limits the risks associated with investments in individual stocks. DCA further helps to reduce these concerns. Nuveen, the asset management company, completed an assessment of the historical performance of a hypothetical DCA approach to investing in U.S. stocks. If an investor put $500 each month into this investment from 2000 to 2020\u2014an investment of $120,000 total over a 20-year span\u2014they would achieve a total accumulation of $280,801 during that time. By contrast, consider a lump-sum investment of the same principal. An investor buying $120,000 worth of the SPY at the beginning of 2000, at a price of $94.20 per share, would have ended up with about 1,273 shares. Based on a closing price of $352.05 on December 31, 2020, those shares would be worth $448,159.65.However, this does not account for management fees accrued over the 20-year period, nor does it include dividend reinvestments. While it seems that a lump-sum investment wins out in this case, keep in mind that fluctuations in the market leave such an investment particularly exposed. For example, cashing out on March 27, 2020, not quite a full 20 years into the lump-sum investment, would yield around $305,847, again not counting management fees or dividends. One of the key benefits of DCA is mitigating the price risk associated with attempting to time the market. Historically speaking, investors trying to time the market tend to miss some rallies. DCA ensures that you can capture those gains. It may also help to reduce emotional decision-making and to lower average purchase prices for a particular security. Because the best days of the market often come at times of significant volatility\u2014when investors may be cautious\u2014dollar-cost averaging helps reluctant investors to still benefit during those periods. Beyond that, DCA can be helpful for investors lacking a sizable amount of capital to put toward an investment up front. By spreading an investment out across multiple contributions, they may make the process of investing more accessible. That said,DCA does have some limitations alongside its benefits. Investors using DCA may forfeit higher returns, particularly in times when the market is consistently rising. Think of it this way: with DCA, an investor is holding a higher percentage of an investment as cash for a longer time. This reduces risk, but also means they can miss out during an extended rally. Keep in mind that it\u2019s also crucially important to select quality investment targets in order for your principal to grow over time. Beyond that, fees may be a factor as well\u2014a dollar-cost averaging strategy that invests a small amount of money in a security every day, for example, might lose a sizable portion of its capital to transaction fees. Setting up a DCA plan with your brokerage account is fairly straightforward. Follow these steps to do so: There is not necessarily a benefit to using an automatic or a manual contribution strategy, though some investors may find that setting automatic contributions makes them less likely to accidentally forget to make an investment when the time has come. To learn more about investing in the S&P 500, check outour complete guide. Lump-sum investing may outperform dollar-cost averaging over the long term, as more of an investor\u2019s money is exposed to market growth for a longer period of time. Of course, this is only the case if the target investment generally trends upward. Lump-sum investing also increases the risk of loss of capital if prices trend downward. DCA can be combined with a variety of other investment strategies. For example, DCA can help to stabilize a value or growth approach to avoid emotional decisions about when to enter a position or to minimize the impact of volatility. DCA could also be combined with an asset allocation focus to gradually build up investments in stocks, bonds, commodities, and other vehicles over time. There is no single approach to DCA, but some best practices include periodically re-evaluating your investment goals to ensure that your target investment and the amount and timing of each contribution is appropriate. If you\u2019re taking a long-term approach to DCA, you may find that an increase in your income over time allows you to periodically increase the contribution amount. You can also use DCA to help rebalance a portfolio over time by gradually shifting the focus of your investments. Dollar-cost averaging spaces an investment out over time, re-allocating it into smaller portions made at regular intervals. Many investors find that DCA helps them to avoid trying to time the market and allows them to capture gains from rallies that take place during volatile periods in which they may otherwise be disinclined to invest.A DCA approach with a fund linked to the S&P 500 may be suitable, given that the market trends upward over time. DCA may also be more accessible for many investors who lack the capital available to make lump-sum investment payments. On the other hand, lump-sum investments in funds that tend to grow fairly steadily may outperform DCA strategies over time because a larger portion of the investment principal is exposed to market growth conditions for longer. This approach also consolidates the number of transactions, potentially helping to reduce fees. If you\u2019re an investor who tends to react emotionally to market news\u2014or even if you don\u2019t suspect that you do\u2014or someone wishing to take the timing element out of consideration when you approach your investments, DCA may be a good option for you.",

The company reported comparable club sales rose 1.6% year-over-year, about half of what analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for. When the gasoline sales impact was excluded, they were up 3.9%, above expectations. The sliding same-store sales led to BJ's narrowly missing estimates with revenue of $5.15 billion, a nearly 5% increase from a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 was better than expected. Membership fee income grew 8% to $120.4 million, boosted by an increase in annual fees that took effect in January. While some retailers have lowered their outlook on concerns about the effect of new tariffs, BJ's held its full-year guidance steady, including comparable club sales excluding gasoline 2.0% to 3.5% higher, and adjusted EPS of $4.10 to $4.30. \"We are confident in our team, our positioning in the marketplace and the growth drivers that are within our control,\" CFO Laura Felice said.

        "content": "Renewable energy stocks tumbled after the House of Representatives passed a tax bill that effectively nullifies many Biden-era green energy initiatives, a move seen as deeply damaging to the solar sector. Shares of SunRun (RUN) tumbled more than 38%, while Enphase Energy (ENPH) dropped 19% to lead S&P 500 decliners. NextEra Energy (NEE) stock slid 9%, and First Solar\u00a0(FSLR) was off about 4%. The House on Thursday morning passeda tax and spending billthat would end tax credits for wind and solar projects in 2029, years earlier than a previous version of the bill. The bill also requires projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill\u2019s passage to qualify for those credits, a next-to-impossible timeline for any infrastructure project. Jefferies analysts in a note Thursday called the bill a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to theInflation Reduction Act, 2022 legislation that established tax incentives to spur clean energy investment. The bill makes claiming most IRA tax credits \u201ctruly untenable,\u201d Jefferies said, and is a \u201cworse than feared\u201d outcome for the solar industry. SunRun was particularly hard hit by a last-minute addition that excludes companies that rent residential solar equipment to customers from earning certain tax credits. The bill now moves to the Senate. Jefferies expects the Senate to focus on Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) language, which restricts tax benefits for companies with supposed ties to hostile governments, and the phaseout timeline of clean electricity credits. Jefferies expects the stocks of domestic solar companies like First Solar to outperform competitors due to the House bill\u2019s more aggressive FEOC language. However, the entire industry may be \u201cadrift\u201d for weeks before the Senate releases its own markup of the bill, its analysts wrote.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock is likely to gain or lose as much as 7.4% the day after the AI chipmaker reports quarterly earnings results May 28, options traders tracked by Bloomberg predict. The 7.4% figure from Bloomberg consensus data is lower than the average 11.3% swing in Nvidia shares during intraday trading the day following earnings results over the past eight quarters. This means options traders expect a lower level of volatility from Nvidia shares on May 29 as compared to the prior eight quarters. Nvidia shares fell 8.5% in February afterthe company's fourth quarter earnings topped Wall Street's expectations, but its outlook for first quarter gross margin came in lower than estimates. The day after the chipmaker\u2019s earnings report, shares rose as much as 2.8% and fell as much as 8.6%, trading in a range of 11.4%. While the range expected by options traders for the trading session May 29 could mean Nvidia stock gains as much as 7.4% or loses as much as 7.4%, it also implies other potential scenarios. For example, the stock could gain as much as 5.4% and fall as much as 2%. Or it could fall as much as 4% and rise as much as 3.4%. Though Nvidia shares have, on average, proven volatile following the company's last eight quarterly earnings reports, investors have seen big gains from holding on to their Nvidia shares. According to data compiled by Yahoo Finance Anchor Jared Blikre over the past 10 years, Nvidia shareholders have seen a nearly 120% median return if they buy shares before Nvidia\u2019s earnings results and hold on to them for 12 months. Nvidia\u2019s May 28 results come after a turbulent year for the stock amid AI developments in China and ever-changing trade policies from the Trump administration. Nvidia stock struggled to start 2025after a new cheap AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeekprompted skepticismof Big Tech's massive spending on AI infrastructure and fears of a spending slowdown. Signs of a potential slowdown in AI data center investments from Microsoft (MSFT), one of Nvidia's biggest customers, further fueled those fears. President Trump\u2019s trade war with China, hisban on exports of Nvidia's specialized chips to the country, andthreats of global reciprocal tariffshave alsohammered the stock, just as Nvidia\u2019s competition in the Chinese market from domestic tech firm Huawei heats up. The US temporary trade truce with China,Nvidia\u2019s business prospects abroad (i.e., its expansion into Saudi Arabia), and Trump\u2019s repeal of a restrictive Biden-era chip trade policyhaveboosted shares in recent weeksahead of the chipmaker\u2019s earnings report. Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to report soaring earnings and revenue for its fiscal 2026 first quarter (the April quarter), though they expect its growth to continue decelerating. Analysts project revenue will rise over 66% to $43 billion in the first quarter and adjusted earnings per share to leap 44% to $0.88. By comparison, in the first quarter of last year, Nvidia reported revenue rising a staggering 262% and earnings per share growing 461%. Investors will be closely watching for signs of impact from Trump's ban on Nvidia's chip sales to China in next week's results \u2014 a policy CEO Jensen Huang said hascost the company $15 billion in sales.

Adding to pressures facing the embattled health insurance giant and others in the sector, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said it plans a \"significant expansion\" of its auditing efforts for Medicare Advantage plans. Since reaching their April high, UnitedHealth shares have lost about half their value, weighed down by multiple challenges\u2014including a Justice Departmentinvestigation of the heath insurer for Medicare fraud, itsCEO\u2019s abrupt departure, and the company's withdrawal of its full-year guidance. Below, we take a closer look at UnitedHealth\u2019sweekly chartand usetechnical analysisto identify key price levels after the stock\u2019s recent volatility.

The stockrallied earlier this week, but has since pared most of those gains to form agravestone doji. While chart watchers typically associate it as a bearishcandlestick pattern, a gravestone doji can also indicate a bullish reversal, especially if it emerges after an extendeddowntrend, such as on UnitedHealth\u2019s chart. It\u2019s worth pointing out thattrading volumehas surged over the past two weeks, potentially signalingcapitulationselling, an event that can mark the end of a steep decline. Below, we identify several keysupport and resistancelevels on UnitedHealth\u2019s chart that could be worth watching. First, it\u2019s worth watching the $292 level. The shares could find support in this area near last week\u2019s close, which also closely aligns with a range or correspondingprice actionon the chart between late 2019 and mid-2020. A decisive close below this keytechnicallevel could see the shares revisit lower support around $249. Bargain hunters may look for long-term buying opportunities in this location near a series of trading activity on the chart from early 2018 to March 2020. Initial recovery efforts in the stock could meet resistance at the $325 level. Tactical traders seeking to capitalize on short-term price swings may place sell orders near this week\u2019s high, which roughly aligns with the August 2020peakand February 2021 trough.

Pegatron projected triple-digit server revenue growth this quarter sequentially backed by the demand frenzy.

Apple Inc\u2019s(NASDAQ:AAPL) Taiwanese iPhone assembler plans to ship more server samples this quarter and expects annual server revenue to double from last year, Teng said. Server products based on Nvidia Corp\u2019s GB300 chips will likely gain traction in the second half of 2025, as per Teng. The company has also identified potential opportunities in Japan and the Middle East.

        "content": "Investors can pause to catch their breath after a wild last few months. Cooler heads appear to have prevailed in the trade war, theQ1 earnings seasonwas better than expected, and (for now) economic data is hanging in there. According to Econoday, the last few US payrolls reports point to a slowing, but not halting, labor market. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TAP. The US unemployment rate has been steady around the 4.2% mark, while average hourly earnings have drifted down to 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. Moreover, CPI inflation data from February through April were largely below estimates. Now more than ever, though, both company-specific and economy-wide data are seen as less relevant. Last week's Retail Sales report, while light, didn't raise recession flags, and next week's April Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index print (which comes alongside the Personal Income and Outlays report) won't fully reflect the impact of tariffs. Mark your calendar for several macro updates, according to Wall Street Horizon's newEconomic Calendar data. First, the minutes from the May 6-7 Fed meeting are set to be released on Wednesday, May 28th. Following that, the June FOMC gathering could be livelier as we'll get fresh forecasts from voting members via the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and the always-revealing Fed dot plot. Lastly, recession fears have ebbed in the last few months but be on guard for possible volatility around the second look at Q1 GDP, which hits the tape on Thursday, May 29. Yes, plenty of macro volatility catalysts are in the offing, but don't sleep on the long list of key shareholder meetings ahead. Specifically, severalMagnificent Seven companieshave Annual General Meetings (AGM) over the coming weeks. Beyond those glamour stocks, a handful of other large-cap bellwethers host events to update equity owners on company performance, strategic plans, and firm-specific and macro conditions they see. At the events, investors exercise their voting rights and engage with management, usually friendly but sometimes hostile. Wedetailed notable shareholder meeting events in Aprilwhen volatility was near its zenith. Today, as panic has subsided and with the carrot of tax cuts dangling and hopes revived for deregulation, there could be a more upbeat tone. Here are the headline shareholder meetings scheduled: May 20: JPMorgan Chase & Company The Financials sector faces challenges and opportunities. On the positive side, last week's major IPO, eToro (ETOR), was quite encouraging for capital markets. Shares soared on their first day of trading, while the day before, fintech company Chime filed for a Nasdaq IPO.1Moreover, KKR (KKR) received an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, and fellow capital markets company Carlyle (CG) got a boost from TD Cowen.2And all of a sudden, M&A is kicking up in the shoe space (see: Skechers and Foot Locker). Good news for the JPM Investment Banking department. Unfortunately, last week's quarterly report on household debt from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York underscored a deterioration in consumer finances, including lower collective credit scores as household debt swells.3 JPM is arguably the most important global financial institution, headed by Jamie Dimon, dubbed America's banker. Investors should pay attention to what transpires today at JPM's AGM. May 21: Amazon Turning to the Mag 7, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a load lifted off its back when the US and China chose to roll back most tariffs earlier this month. Shares soared by more than 8% on Monday last week, though they remain far below their $242 all-time high notched in February. The company also confirmed a small workforce reduction, adding to the list of recent layoff announcements. Still, its most recent earnings report was solida double beatwith Amazon Web Services (AWS) growing 17% YoY.4Be on the lookout for any updates from CEO Andy Jassy this Wednesday. May 28: Meta Platforms Next week, before the PCE report and three-day weekend, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) welcomes shareholders to its virtual event. It, too, beat Q1 sales and earnings estimates, helping to lift shares off their April 21 low under $500. META is the top-performing mega-cap tech stock year to date, with some arguing that it is executing the best on AI strategy. Despite fears of reduced ad spending amid all the macro uncertainty, it grew profits by 35% in the first quarter and issued solid guidance for the balance of the year. The kicker was a significant increase in its FY 2025 capex forecast.5We'll see if executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, discuss those plans in more detail next Wednesday. June 5: Netflix Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), while not officially a member of the Magnificent Seven, is among 2025's best stocks. Through last Wednesday, shares were up 29% on the year, ranking it 13th best among all S&P 500 companies YTD. The Movies and Entertainment industry company within the Communication Services sector ruffled some feathers a month ago when it was reported that a $1 trillion market cap was targeted by co-CEO Ted Sarandos.6 That doesn't seem so out of line today, with NFLX knocking on the door of a $500 million equity valuation. Last week, the firm said its ad tier now has 94 million monthly active users, up 34% just since November and higher by a whopping 135% from 12 months ago.7Seen as a recession-resistant and tariff-buffered asset-light company, investors will surely be upbeat heading into the June AGM. June 6: Alphabet The Mag 7 is not a monolith. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has struggled in 2025, with the stock down by more than 10%,a strong Q1 reportnotwithstanding. Earlier this month, news broke that Apple's (AAPL) Eddy Cue testified that Safari searches were down for the first time in 22 years.8That was bad news for Alphabet since its search engine is the default for Apple products. It will be critical to hear from CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives on not just search, but also ongoing Justice Department probes and how the $2 trillion market cap company plans to make inroads into AI as the competition grows fiercer. June 25: NVIDIA Last but not least, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been on a heater in the past several weeks. Through May 21, the stock was up by more than 50% from the April nadir. CEO Jensen Huang appears to be in President Trump's good graces as he joined the POTUS and other tech leaders in a pivotal business trip to the Middle East. To wit, BofA noted that NVIDIA was among the top beneficiaries from deals inked in Saudi Arabia last week.9The bulls hope such capital investments and new orders will be the next leg of the AI boom. Expect to hear more about the broader outlook on June 25, and NVIDIAreports quarterly results on Wednesdaynight next week. The bulk of Q1 earnings season is in the books, and we have some stability on the trade front. That makes upcoming shareholder meetings all the more important as investors look ahead to the year's second half. There are individual company stories and macro trends that shape capital project plans and dictate shareholder-friendly initiatives likestock buybacks and dividends. Be sure to take detailed notes during the Mag 7 AGM season. 1 Stock trading app eToro pops 29% in Nasdaq debut after pricing IPO above expected range, CNBC, Samantha Subin, May 14, 2025,https://www.cnbc.com2 Morgan Stanley Upgrades KKR (KKR), Nasdaq, George Maybach, May 14, 2025,https://www.nasdaq.com3 As student loan default rate spikes, some borrowers face grave consequences,' New York Fed says, CNBC, May 13, 2025,https://www.cnbc.com4 Amazon.com Announces First Quarter Results, Amazon Inc, May 1, 2025,https://ir.aboutamazon.com5 Meta Reports First Quarter 2025 Results, Meta Inc., April 30, 2025,https://investor.atmeta.com6 Netflix aims to be a trillion-dollar company, says co-CEO, TechCrunch, Lauren Forristal, April 23, 2025,https://techcrunch.com7 Netflix says its ad tier now has 94 million monthly active users, CNBC, Sara Salinas, May 14, 2025,https://www.cnbc.com8 Searches on Safari dipped for the first time in 22 years, Apple's Eddy Cue admits, and it's because more people are using AI instead of Google, Fortune, Sasha Rogelberg, May 8, 2025,https://fortune.com9 Nvidia, AMD 'top beneficiaries' from Saudi deals, but Broadcom and Marvell will benefit: BofA, Seeking Alpha, Chris Ciaccia, May 14, 2025,https://seekingalpha.com Copyright 2025 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "header": "Nvidia earnings: Will US export controls weigh on chipmaker?",
        "content": "Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is due to release its first quarter earnings results on Wednesday, May 28, closing out earnings season for the Magnificent Seven. Bloomberg consensus currently forecasts quarterly revenue to come out to $43.3 billion with adjusted earnings per share of $0.88. Yahoo Finance tech editorDan Howleyexplains what Wall Street is expecting from the chip stock on its big earnings day, especially as CEO Jensen Huang has called for the Trump administration to repeal Biden-era curbs on AI chip exports to China. Also catch Yahoo Finance's analysis of how Nvidia's stock hashistorically reacted to earnings results. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Wait is almost over. Nvidia set to report its first quarter results on Wednesday, May 28th, after the market close. Here's what investors have their sights on. Let's get to Yahoo finances Dan Howley. Hey, Dan. That's right, Maddie. We're expecting Nvidia to report earnings per share of, uh, sorry, 88 cents on revenue of 43.3 billion. That would be a jump from 61 cents and 26 billion in Q1 last year. Now, Nvidia's shares have been kind of on a roller coaster since the start of the year. There's been issues related to export controls, the AI diffusion rules that the Biden administration put in place before leaving office, fears over exports, excuse me, tariffs, but that seems to be kind of waning at this point. The Trump administration did away with the Biden AI diffusion rules. But they do say that they're going to put some other kind of regulation in place. They haven't kind of illustrated what that might be. The other thing is that they're allowing them to sell their chips to countries like Saudi Arabia, as well as the United Arab Emirates. We saw the news reports when Trump was in the Middle East that they'll be taking part in the project Stargate in the UAE. And then in Saudi Arabia, they're expected to sell hundreds of thousands of GPUs over the next five years. So not, you know, exactly this year, but in the coming years. And as for Stargate, well, it depends on if that ever really kind of gets off the ground or not. There's been some funding stuff going on there with the US project. But for Nvidia, that's good news. Now, we did see Jensen Wong during Computex, the trade show in Taipei, Taiwan, criticizing the US's export rules saying that they've been a failure so far, and basically that they're helping more or less Chinese companies build their own chips and kind of reach the ability that Nvidia has to offer, or may reach the ability that Nvidia has to offer when it comes to the power of their chips. So we'll see what that means for Nvidia and the Trump administration, whether or not they'll ease export controls to China. There have been reports from Reuters that Nvidia's working on a new chip that they would be allowed to sell into the Chinese market. Remember, we're expecting a 5.5 billion dollar charge that Nvidia's going to have to write down based on the Trump administration's H20 rules, basically Nvidia's H20 chip not being allowed to be sold in China is hitting Nvidia's bottom line to a degree. So we're expected to see obviously healthy growth. It depends on what Wall Street though kind of is anticipating as far as, you know, blow it out of the water, right? They had a beat and raise going for a while. The growth is it's still going to be over 100% in some cases, but you know, it's not the 200, 300% that we had seen. And after earnings, we've kind of seen investors pull back a little bit afterwards as a result of that. So I think it's about getting those expectations in line, and then really what we can see from Jensen and company as far as what they expect in the coming months with regards to regulation or tariffs. We know that the Trump administration is forming an investigation into whether or not they should have tariffs on semiconductors. So there's still a lot going on with regards to Washington and how that impacts Nvidia. But for now, it still seems though, the big tech companies, the Microsofts, Googles, Amazons, Metas, they're still on board with spending the billions of dollars they said at the beginning of the year on their infrastructure. That's still in line, so Nvidia's going to be the beneficiary of that for sure. Dan, you know, Nvidia did struggle to start the year and we talked a lot about it. There were different kinds of puts and takes. Two big themes, Dan, we discussed were, you know, there were concerns about DeepC, the Chinese startup. There were concerns about Big Tech and whether, you know, maybe they were going to stop spending as much on building out their own AI infrastructure. Do you think those two concerns, Dan, as we head into this next earnings report, are they in the rearview mirror? For Big Tech, yes, I think that people are, you know, kind of they've seen that despite, you know, the tariff noise and questions about the macro environment, that these companies have said that they're going to spend the money that they said they were going to spend originally. So that doesn't seem to be a concern in the near term. As far as DeepC goes, Nvidia's kind of spun up this narrative that these kind of models that require a longer time to think benefit from more processing power. And so, as a result, when you use a model like DeepC on a higher-end Nvidia chips, you're going to get better results because it's able to process more information. So that's been the ongoing theme that we've seen out of a lot of tech companies, really. These kind of processing models that they'll be able to kind of get more information through the models, and that'll benefit them. So, you know, I think for DeepC, for the most part, that's no longer a concern. I think DeepC is a concern for Washington and that impacts the export controls, but not necessarily for Nvidia itself. Dan, thank you, sir. Appreciate it.",

PresidentDonald Trumphas touted multi-trillion-dollar investment commitments as proof that his economic strategy is delivering a historic revival ofAmerican manufacturing and infrastructure. Yet, behind the massive figures, new analysis from Goldman Sachs suggests the actual economic impact could be far more modest. Foreign governments and corporations have pledged over $6 trillion in U.S. investments, including $2 trillion from companies and $4.2 trillion from foreign governments, according to Goldman Sachs economist Joseph Briggs. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. Just a week ago, President Trump secured $2 trillion in investment commitments from Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Japan pledged $1 trillion. Among the companies making the largest pledges,Nvidia Corp.(NASDAQ:NVDA) announced $787 billion, followed byInternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE:IBM) with $409 billion,Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) with $302 billion, andEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) with $35 billion. \"We expect the impact on U.S. investment to be smaller than suggested by these promises for three reasons,\" Briggs said in a report, highlighting project uncertainty, limited alignment with national accounts definitions, and overlap with prior plans. After analyzing the announcements and stripping out less tangible commitments\u2014like purchases of goods, partnerships, and reannounced projects\u2014Goldman estimates that only $135 billion in new annual investment is directly tied to GDP-relevant projects like physical capital expenditures and R&D. Applying historical realization rates and analyst feedback, the bank sees the likely net impact closer to $30 billion per year, or just 0.1% of U.S. GDP. That figure starkly contrasts with headline projections that initially suggested a 4% GDP boost over time.

Many large-cap companies, including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., have promised massive investments\u2014$500 billion each over multiple years\u2014but their past spending doesn't align. Apple spent just $10 billion on U.S. capex and $31.4 billion on global R&D in 2024. Nvidia's corresponding figures were even lower, suggesting that headline figures may include spending on acquisitions, partnerships or input costs that don't translate into actual U.S. capital formation. Further, Goldman's equity analysts found that 69% of the corporate investments likely overlap with previously planned spending, with just 6% seen as mostly new. Goldman Sachs noted that \u201cthese announcements have not driven major upgrades to equity analyst capex forecasts.\u201d \u201cIn contrast to company-level announcements, investment promises from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Japan could provide a material incremental increase if they materialize,\u201d Briggs said. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Japan and the UAE have announced ambitious commitments\u2014from AI data centers to energy infrastructure and defense purchases. Both Saudi Arabia and Qatar emphasized large-scale purchases of U.S. goods\u2014$142 billion in defense contracts from Saudi Arabia and $96 billion in aircraft orders from Qatar\u2014which would support U.S. GDP through exports, but not count as domestic investment. Yet, the lack of specificity on most other announced projects suggests that much of the foreign capital may contribute indirectly by lowering financing costs rather than driving immediate, measurable increases in U.S. capital formation.

        "header": "Why IonQ Skyrocketed Almost 40% Today",
        "content": "Shares of quantum computing companyIonQ(IONQ37.09%)skyrocketed 37% on Thursday, after CEO Niccolo de Masi sat down withBarron'sfor an interview. During the interview, he outlined a lofty goal for the company, and even said that IonQ would be the \"Nvidia\" ofquantum computing. However, a mere aspirational comment like that shouldn't put this speculative stock up by this much. Delving into the interview, there really wasn't anything tangible to warrant this kind of stock price increase. As we've seen over the past two years, whenever a stock is compared with Nvidia or has been shown to have received an investment from or partnership with the company, speculators tend to pile in. This happened just last week with respect to newly public \"neo-cloud\"CoreWeave, which skyrocketed after it wasdisclosed Nvidia had increased its position in the stock. However, that can be a double-edged sword. After all,SoundHound AIplunged earlier this year when it was disclosed Nvidia had sold its entire stake in the company. SoundHound's stock hasn't recovered. In theBarron'sinterview, De Masi said of the quantum computing industry: \"I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player. There will be other people that copy us and follow us; they have always copied and followed us.\" No doubt, IonQ was the first publicly traded quantum stock, with IonQ's strategy focused on early commercialization through its trapped-ion process. Meanwhile, other competitors have taken other approaches they believe will ultimately win out, but may take longer to commercialize. Later in the interview, de Masi predicted that someone would \"pay hundreds of billions of dollars to buy IonQ,\" because he anticipates a major cloud computing provider will want IonQ's quantum technology in-house as a differentiator. Given that the company'smarket capwas only around $8.75 billion heading into today, it's perhaps not surprising the stock is seeing a big surge on those comments. Image source: Getty Images. Investors should be very cautious of any quantum computing stock, and especially of chasing one on a day like today. For all of de Masi's talk, IonQ only generated $7.6 million in revenue last quarter, with a $32.3 million loss. And for all the \"Nvidia\" parallels, it's very unclear how big the quantum computing market will be. Furthermore, Nvidia was able to develop its artificial intelligence (AI) GPUs and CUDA software almost completely unchallenged for 15 years, prior to the explosion of AI technology. However, IonQ not only has a slew of start-up competitors, but the large cloud players De Masi references mostly also have their own in-house quantum research as well. Needless to say, this rally is largely based on hype, and could be driven bymeme stockinvestors trying to force ashort squeeze, with about 18% of IonQ's stock sold short. But as we've seen in the past, big surges like this can be fleeting. Quantum commercialization is still years away -- perhaps many years.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump said he is considering making a big change to the housing market that could impact how much it costs to get a mortgage. In a Thursday evening Truth Social post, Trump said he was considering taking mortgage finance firmsFannie Mae and Freddie Macpublic after they had been under government control since the2008 financial crisis. \u201cI am giving very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public,\u201d Trump said in his post. \u201cFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right.\u201d While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are publicly traded on over-the-counter markets, the U.S. Treasury controls a majority of the companies' ownership. While Trump\u2019s post did not have many details, he is likely referring to the idea that the government divest its ownership stake, with the two companies re-entering the stock market through aninitial public offering (IPO). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don\u2019t issue loans to homebuyers, but they support the housing market bybuying mortgages from banksand other lenders. This helps keep cash flowing into the housing market and supports financial institutions\u2019 abilities to issue more housing loans. During the 2008 financial crisis, the government placed these two entities into a \u201cconservatorship,\u201d providing a bailout to the organizations while also giving theFederal Housing Finance Agency(FHFA) more leeway to operate the lenders. Trump said he would speak with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick andFHFA Director William Pulteabout the decision. Pulte has said that he would support releasing Fannie and Freddie from government control. In contrast, Bessent said in a February interview that he would evaluate the decision on how it would affect mortgage rates. Some worry that mortgage rates could rise if Fannie and Freddie are returned to the private sector.\u00a0 Moody\u2019s Chief Economist Mark Zandi told CNN in 2024 that costs for borrowers could increase by $1,800 to $2,800 if the transition isn\u2019t handled properly. However, relinquishing government control of Fannie and Freddie could be a windfall for the U.S. government, which could realize around $300 billion in profit from the deal, according to Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman, who supports the move.Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square portfolio includes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac common stock and he has argued that the companies are now adequately capitalized to return to private ownership.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, May 20, Infineon Technologies (OTC:IFNNY) announced a collaboration with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to revolutionize the power delivery architecture for future AI data centers. This initiative focuses on developing next-gen power systems based on a new architecture that utilizes central power generation of 800 V high-voltage direct current/HVDC. A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. The goal is to increase energy-efficient power distribution throughout the data center and enable direct power conversion at the AI chip/GPU within the server board. The 800V HVDC system architecture enhances reliability and efficiency, which is crucial as AI data centers are already exceeding 100,000 individual GPUs and are projected to require power outputs of 1MW or more per IT rack before the end of the decade. Infineon Technologies (OTC:IFNNY) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) emphasize that this collaboration will set a new industry standard for power architecture in AI data centers. Infineon's expertise in power conversion solutions is accelerating the adoption of this full-scale HVDC architecture. This approach contrasts with the current decentralized power supply using numerous power supply units and will optimize server rack space and enable upgrades to even higher distribution voltages.
