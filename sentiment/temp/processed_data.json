        "content": "Apple (AAPL) shares will be in the spotlight ahead of the iPhone maker\u2019s highly anticipated fiscal second-quarter results, due after Thursday\u2019s closing bell. Wall Street will be paying close attention to the tech giant\u2019s guidance for the current quarter in an effort to determine whatimpact tariffs and potential price increaseshave had on consumer demand for the company\u2019s devices. Investors will also be looking for updates on recent reports that Apple intends to produce most of its U.S.-sold iPhones in India by the end of 2026. The company is aiming to mitigate risks related to the Trump administration\u2019s steep import duties imposed on China, a country where Apple reportedly assembles up to 90% of its iPhones. Apple shares trade 16% lower year to date as of Friday\u2019s close but have recovered nearly 25% from this month\u2019s low as investors assess the company\u2019s plans to navigate tariff-related challenges. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Apple\u2019sweekly chartand identify key price levels worth watching ahead of the tech giant\u2019s earnings report. After staging a dramatic intradayreversalat the 200-week moving average (MA) on above-averagevolumeearlier this month, Apple shares have continued to gain ground. However, while therelative strength index (RSI)has moved upwards ahead, the indicator remains just below the 50 threshold, signaling lackluster price momentum. Let\u2019s point out keysupport and resistancelevels on Apple's chart that investors will likely be monitoring. The first area to monitor sits around $169. Retracements to this level on the chart would likely attract strong buying interest near this month\u2019s low, which also closely aligns with the August 2022peak and troughsin October 2023 and April 2024. Thebulls\u2019 failure to defend this key technical level opens the door for a drop to lower support at $157. Investors could seekentry pointsin this region near ahorizontal linethat connects several peaks and troughs on the chart between September 2021 and March 2023. In the event of a rally, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on the $220 level, an area currently just below the 50-week MA. The shares could run into selling pressure in this location nearprice actionon the chart extending back to June last year. Finally, further buying could see Apple's stock revisit the $237 area. Investors who haveaccumulated sharesat lower prices may seekprofit-takingopportunities in this region near last year\u2019s July and October peaks.

        "header": "This Could Be a Make-It-or-Break-It Moment for Nvidia. Here's What to Watch For This Week.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)has been one of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom so far. The tech giant designs the world's most powerful chip -- a graphics processing unit (GPU) -- and it's become the star player in the AI buildout. GPUs are used to drive the most critical AI tasks, such as the training and inference of models. The company hasn't stuck to only chips, though. Instead it's constructed an AI empire, offering the products and services customers need to develop and expand infrastructure and eventually apply AI to real-life problems. All of this has helped drive Nvidia's revenue to record levels quarter after quarter; in the latest full year, revenue surged 114% to $130 billion. The company has also been able to generate high profitability on sales, with gross margin consistently topping 70%. This is fantastic, but considering the potential fora tougher economic environmentahead, investors have worried about one particular thing -- and this factor could determine whether Nvidia's growth soars or sinks in the quarters ahead. Now, as earnings season unfolds, we're about to get some answers on this point. In fact, some key information could be announced this week, making right now a make-or-break moment for Nvidia. Here's what to watch for. Image source: Getty Images. So first, let's consider the reason for the company's success. Of course, its high-performance products and services top the list. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, released this winter, includes various game-changing elements; these include the fastest chip yet, as well as gains in reliability, networking, and security. Demand for Blackwell was so high that it exceeded supply, and Nvidia is still working tirelessly to ensure delivery of this innovative platform to customers. What has also played a big role in Nvidia's success, though, is the general demand for AI. If customers weren't interested in building out major platforms, Nvidia's revenue picture would look much different. The company relies heavily on this need for AI -- in the most recent quarter, 90% of its total revenue came from its data center business. This is why the general trend in AI investment and buildout directly impacts its prospects for revenue in the quarters ahead. Any signs of a decline in such spending would immediately spark worries in the investment community about Nvidia's growth. And this brings me to the crucial happenings to watch this week, as they could seriously impact Nvidia's prospects and stock performance. Major Nvidia customersMicrosoft,Amazon, andMeta Platformseach report quarterly earnings this week -- and during earnings calls, these companies generally offer an update ontheir AI programsand spending plans for the year. Though these three companies have been going all in on AI in recent quarters, recent events could alter their strategies. President Donald Trump's plans to impose tariffs on imports worldwide may hurt them in two ways: Tariffs could increase their expenses as they import parts and finished goods, and in an environment of higher prices caused by tariffs, consumers may have less money to spend on these tech companies' products. The concern is that against this backdrop, Nvidia's customers may slow or cut their AI spending. So it will be very important for Nvidia shareholders (or potential shareholders) to listen closely to any comments on AI plans from Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta during their earnings reports. Now if you're worried, I have good news for you. So far, there's reason to be optimistic about AI demand ahead -- even with the current tariff turmoil. Last week another big Nvidia customer,Alphabet(GOOG1.52%)(GOOGL1.70%), reiterated its plans for $75 billion in capital spending this year and said its relationship with Nvidia is a \"key advantage.\" Alphabet also said it will offer Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin superchips when they become available, further showing an ongoing commitment to the chip designer. We also have a positive signal from Amazon Web Services (AWS) ahead of Amazon's earnings report. Last week, an analyst report suggested the company might be cutting back on AI spending, but anAWS executive calmed fears, saying expansion plans haven't changed. All of this means that yes, Nvidia has reached a make-or-break moment. Ongoing strength in AI spending would be great news, but any surprise cut in spending or AI buildout by a major customer could deal a significant blow to the chip giant, at least in the near term. As I mentioned above, signs so far are showing the pace of this AI boom may continue uninterrupted -- but only reassurances from these big Nvidia customers this week will confirm this.",

        "header": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among the Best Self-Driving Car Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the11 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other self-driving car stocks. The term \u201cself-driving car stocks\u201d describes publicly traded businesses engaged in creating, manufacturing, or using autonomous vehicle technology. These businesses either directly contribute to the development of self-driving systems or offer crucial parts and services to the autonomous driving industry. The autonomous vehicle market is booming. Grand View Research estimates that the global market for autonomous vehicles was worth $68.09 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9% from 2025 to 2030. The industry is driven by the significant demand for tech adoption by customers, road safety, connectivity, advancements in AI, and sensor technology. In 2024, the passenger vehicle segment led the industry and accounted for 69% of the global revenue. The North American autonomous vehicle market dominated the global market with a share of over 37.1% in 2024. On the other hand, according to Goldman Sachs Research, Level 3 autonomous cars, which permit hands-off, eyes-off driving in some situations, might make up as much as 10% of new cars sold globally by 2030, down from a previous estimate of 12%. It is anticipated that level 4 fully autonomous vehicles will account for 2.5% of sales, up from 3.5% in the past. Vehicles classified as Level 2 and Level 2+, which need to be supervised, are projected to rise from 20% at present to 30% by 2027. Adoption is expected to speed up due to AI advancements and declining hardware prices, notwithstanding delays caused by technological, legislative, and business model obstacles. By 2030, a market for robotaxis valued at over $25 billion would develop, driven by commercial AV fleets. By 2030, the cost of an AV mile might be less than $1, and by 2040, it could be $0.58. Long-term, AVs may account for 60% of new light vehicle sales worldwide by 2040, with China dominating (90%), followed by Europe (80%), and the United States (65%). As per S&P Global\u2019s report, the industry\u2019s focus on self-driving cars has changed from lofty Level 5 autonomy to practical, incremental applications. Tech firms and manufacturers came together at CES 2025 with realistic objectives, especially in the area of Level 4 autonomy. Companies increasingly prefer deployable technology, such as ride-hailing services and automated shuttles, above completely autonomous personal vehicles. Leading this shift is Waymo, which reports more than 4 million trips overall and 150,000 paid rides weekly. It displayed new Hyundai and Zeekr automobiles, growing its business in additional American cities and adjusting to local laws. These actions show ride-hailing\u2019s scalability in light of the present limitations. Meanwhile, conventional automakers showcased autonomous shuttle concepts, while Level 2+ and Level 3 ADAS systems continue to be used in consumer vehicles. As startups with specialized inventions, like AI chips or sensor software, work with larger companies that have the resources and manufacturing capacity, partnerships are growing. Smaller players struggle to operate on their own because of high R&D expenses and regulatory complexity. As the market transitions from hype to practical implementation, Level 4 geo-fenced applications and delivery systems are expected to be the next big thing. The autonomous future is increasingly defined by gradual, cooperative progress rather than disruptive leaps. For this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and compiled an initial list of 20 self-driving stocks. Then we selected the 11 stocks that had the highest upside potential as of April 22, 2025. We have only included stocks in our list with an upside potential of 14% or higher. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential. Note: Not every company included in the list is solely focused on self-driving technology. Some of the stocks highlighted below are involved indirectly by investing in businesses that specialize in autonomous driving. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Analysts\u2019 Upside Potential as of April 22: 63.26% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor company that creates mobile processors and graphics cards for use in workstations, wireless devices, and personal computers. The fundamental components of all computer systems, including those used in self-driving cars, are semiconductors. Thus, it is theBest Autonomous Driving Stock. Through its DRIVE platform, the firm also provides a variety of end-to-end AV solutions, encompassing in-car AV hardware and software as well as artificial intelligence infrastructure. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a multifaceted AV technology player. Before Tesla decided to create its own self-driving chips using Samsung's design and manufacturing platform, the company was a strategic partner of Tesla for many years. Mizuho Securities kept its \"Outperform\" rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a price objective of $168 as of April 16. This reaffirmation comes after the company disclosed additional export limitations imposed by the US government in its most recent 8-K filing. Shipments of its H20 series products to China, including Hong Kong, and other nations subject to US arms embargoes will be impacted by these limitations. A substantial amount of the expected $16 billion in H20 orders, or about $5.5 billion in revenue, may be impacted by these new laws, according to the firm. This suggests that over $10 billion in merchandise may have already been sent for the calendar year 2025. Mizuho analysts are upbeat about the firm's near-term prospects despite the difficulties caused by the export restrictions, particularly with the shipment of the GB200 series and expanded testing capacity for more sophisticated GPU racks. As a crucial consideration for investors, the analysts also emphasized the company\u2019s long-term capital investment in AI for the year 2026. The business has the potential to take on massive markets such as the $50 trillion robotics market, the $500 billion enterprise AI sector, and the $1 trillion+ AI market. Overall, NVDAranks 1stamong the best self-driving car stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "header": "It's Not Too Late to Invest in Artificial Intelligence: 3 Stocks You Might Not Have Known Were AI Plays",
        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence stocks, a lot of the early investment attention has been focused on semiconductor chip designerNvidia(NVDA4.11%), and its stock price has spiked as a result. But lately, its price has become somewhat volatile. There's nothing inherently wrong with Nvidia, which designs many of the best chips used to power artificial intelligence (AI). It isn't shocking for a hot investment theme like AI to be expensive and volatile. But some investors care about valuation or prefer stocks that aren't so volatile. If you are one of these more conservative investors, you don't have to invest in AI the way everyone else seems to be doing it. You can buy picks-and-shovels plays that will benefit alongside AI companies as the technology grows. Here are three stocks you might not have known were AI plays. Artificial intelligenceis impressive but still imperfect. It can make up answers to questions without any connection to reality. It can have trouble properly rendering things such as hands in pictures. And there appear to be few guardrails around how it gets used. These are all issues that have to be addressed, but they aren't the big problem that AI faces. Image source: Getty Images. The big problem is energy. The calculations that make AI possible consume a huge amount of electricity, and the power draw is only going higher from here. Even if more energy-efficient AI is created, it probably won't solve the problem, as demand for AI is increasing at a rapid clip. For example, electricity demand from data centers, where AI effectively lives, is expected to increase by 300% over the next decade. That's a lot of demand growth in a very short period of time. And it is going to provide a powerful tailwind to companies that provide power.Bloom Energy(BE4.46%),Dominion Energy(D-0.75%), andBrookfield Renewable(BEP1.03%)(BEPC0.86%)are particularly well-positioned to benefit. Let's take a closer look at these three unconventional AI plays. One of the issues facing AI anddata centersis the sometimes glacial pace at which utilities can provide connections to the grid. It takes time to build the needed infrastructure, specifically power lines. And it takes time to build the additional capacity, specifically building new power plants. Bloom Energy is well-positioned to bridge the time gap. Bloom Energy makes what it describes as a \"solid oxide platform for distributed generation of electricity.\" Essentially, it builds hydrogen fuel cells in a factory, enabling them to be delivered quickly and easily wherever they are needed. The big story here is the $2.5 billion product backlog and $9 billion service backlog (fuel cell sales generally lead to service contracts, too) that the company had at the end of 2024. Basically, Bloom Energy already has significant demand to serve and will likely see more demand as AI companies look for stopgap measures that allow them to get up and running quickly. Dominion Energy is a boring oldregulated utilitythat is currently offering a generous 5% dividend yield. Being regulated means it must get its rates and investment plans approved by the government. But in exchange for that regulation, Dominion is granted a monopoly in the regions it serves. This is the interesting part with regard to AI. Dominion's territory includes key parts of Virginia, which happens to be one of the most important data center markets in the world. In less than six months, requests for data center hookups increased 88%! This is just one region that Dominion serves, of course, but this demand is highly likely to translate into regulator approval for rate hikes and capital investment plans. And that, in turn, should lead to earnings growth, which management currently believes will hover between 5% and 7% a year for the foreseeable future. While power is important for AI, there's another trend taking shape in the energy space. That's the increasing demand forcleaner energy, which Brookfield Renewable is squarely focused on meeting. It owns a globally diversified portfolio of hydroelectric, solar, wind, and battery power sources and is starting to invest in the nuclear power space. If an AI company is looking to gain access to clean power, Brookfield Renewable is probably on the short list of providers. Notably, Brookfield Renewable already has a multi-year, 10.5-gigawatt deal withMicrosoftto help this technology giant build out its AI data centers. And it is in talks with other companies about similar deals. So, there's a runway for growth ahead for the company in both clean power and AI. You can benefit right along with Brookfield Renewable and collect a yield of up to 6.6% along the way. Bloom Energy, Dominion, and Brookfield Renewable are three interesting examples of ways to invest in AI without actually buying AI stocks. They aren't the only options, of course. However, if you are interested in AI but can't stomach the volatility or valuations in the niche, you might find each of these companies an attractive alternative.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- European stocks gained as traders readied for a week packed with major earnings and economic data, with investors watching for signs of progress in trade negotiations.

Fresh readings on the state of the American economy may support hopes of earlier-than-expected Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. Listen to the Stock Movers podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. \u201cUltimately, it seems that we\u2019re moving towards a place where these policies start to make a little more sense,\u201d Themistoklis Fiotakis, global head of FX strategy at Barclays Plc, told Bloomberg TV. \u201cIf this starts shaping up in a place where markets can understand it, can quantify it, then I think that things are going to normalize.\u201d Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 rose 0.5%, boosted by M&A news out of Italy as Mediobanca made a \u20ac6.3 billion ($7.1 billion) offer for the wealth management arm of Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA. Contracts for the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% following a four-day rally in US equities, the longest winning streak since January. Gold dropped as much as 1.6% as traders unwound positions on signs the metal\u2019s advance may have run too far and too fast. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries climbed three basis points, while the dollar erased earlier gains. Four of the so-called Magnificent Seven \u2014 Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 are due to report earnings this week. Analysts expect the group \u2014 which also includes Google-parent Alphabet Inc., Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. \u2014 to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that\u2019s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions. US non-farm payrolls figures later this week may put \u201coverall macro drivers\u201d such as the health of the American economy higher on investors\u2019 agendas, said Mahjabeen Zaman, head of FX research at ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. Investors are watching for any signs of progress in US trade negotiations after Trump suggested another delay to his higher tariffs was unlikely. Asian economies, facing some of the highest US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, are leading the way over their western counterparts in trade negotiations with the administration. To help manage the next steps, the Trump team has drafted a framework to handle negotiations with about 18 countries, including a template that lays out common areas of concern to guide the discussions. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration is working on bilateral trade deals with 17 key partners, not including China. Bessent reiterated the administration\u2019s argument that Beijing will be forced to the negotiating table because China can\u2019t sustain Trump\u2019s latest tariff level of 145% on Chinese goods. Its standoff with China will likewise limit the potential benefits the US can reap from deals with Asian trading partners, according to Phoenix Kalen, global head of emerging markets research at Societe Generale SA. \u201cAlready there has been a lot of investor sentiment and positioning for some deals to be done, especially with Japan, especially with South Korea,\u201d Kalen told Bloomberg TV. \u201cBut the scope is going to be relatively limited and hampered. The concern especially for Asian trade partners around how China will respond to the terms will limit the extent to which they can agree to certain terms with the Trump administration.\u201d Some of the main moves in markets: Stocks The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5% as of 9:44 a.m. London time S&P 500 futures fell 0.2% Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.2% Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.6% The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 0.4% Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro fell 0.1% to $1.1350 The Japanese yen was little changed at 143.64 per dollar The offshore yuan fell 0.2% to 7.3003 per dollar The British pound was little changed at $1.3328 Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin rose 0.5% to $94,784.07 Ether rose 0.4% to $1,810.44 Bonds The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.26% Germany\u2019s 10-year yield advanced three basis points to 2.50% Britain\u2019s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 4.50% Commodities Brent crude was little changed Spot gold fell 1.1% to $3,283.84 an ounce This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation. --With assistance from Winnie Hsu, Anand Krishnamoorthy and Catherine Bosley.

The average price target is around $243, a premium of about 29% to Friday's close but down from about $259ahead of last quarter's report. Amazon is expected to report $154.96 billion in revenue for the first quarter, up 8% from thefirst quarter a year ago. Adjustedearnings per shareare expected to rise to $1.74 from $1.46 the same time last year. Amazon shares have declined about 14% since the start of the year, amid a tariff-fueled market sell-off that hashit the Magnificent Seven hard. Analysts will likely seek more information about Amazon's plans tokeep up withthe spendingpace of its artificial intelligence rivals. But Wall Street'sattention is also focusedon the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. Amazon stock wasdowngraded earlier this monthby Raymond James analysts who said tariffs on China could hurt Amazon's profit margins and lead to a pullback in advertising revenue from sellers on the platform who rely on Chinese imports. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote recently that they estimate 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, and that roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have \"some China exposure\" that could affect ad spending plans.",

NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is expected to offer an early read on global chip demand, where a year-over-year earnings decline is projected.

The S&P 500 (GSPC) fell 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered below the flatline.

Trump's tariffs continue to crush sentiment across the business and consumer worlds. New data out Monday morning from the Dallas Fed showed overall activity in its manufacturing survey fell to its lowest level since May 2020, as orders, utilization, shipments, and the outlook for business all plummeted. The Dallas Fed's survey also comes along with robust commentary from business leaders gathered by the bank's staff, which shows how the uncertainty related to tariff policy is manifesting across industries. \"There is really no way to predict anything accurately six months out or even six weeks out now for our industry due to the tariff and trade uncertainty,\" said an executive in the computer and electric manufacturing industry. \"Carve-outs for large electronics businesses (cellphones and laptops) leaves small business burdened to deal with tariffs on our own, which are likely to cause delays, cancellations and early product obsolescence on existing products and orders. We have already had to turn around and refuse shipments because customers cannot afford the tariffs, delaying our ability to build, which will eventually lead to job losses.\" In the food manufacturing industry, one executive said, \"Tariffs and tariff uncertainty are wreaking havoc on our supply lines and capital spending plans.\" But it's not only tariffs weighing on business outlooks. Another leader in food manufacturing added that, \"DOGE without a follow-up plan does nothing for the domestic tranquility needed (stable arena for business to function within).\" And a comment from a leader in the machinery manufacturing industry said it best, encapsulating most of the concerns weighing on businesses and consumers right now. \"Nothing is easy,\" this exec said. \"Forecasting is extremely challenging in this time of uncertainty. Committing to growth initiatives is anxiety-riddled. Helping our employees keep beans on their table and a roof over their heads is harder. We believe the direction the current administration is leading our country is on target, but the pain to get there may be longer and more intense than originally anticipated.\" Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Readmore here. Stocks mostly edged higher on Monday ahead of more Big Tech earnings this week, with a focus on tariff negotiations between the US and its trading partners. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) was little changed. Wall Street is coming offa positiveweekly run, as the S&P 500 gained over 4% last week. President Trumpeased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump administration officials have also hinted at easing trade tensions. Investors are hoping for the US to eventually strike a deal with China, though progress on that front is still unclear. Investors await Big Tech earnings this week with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) all set to report in the coming days.

        "content": "We recently published a list of10 Stocks to Watch as Trade Wars Begin. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks to watch as trade wars begin. Bill Strazzullo, Bell Curve Trading chief market strategist, said in a latest program on CNBC that the market isn\u2019t done going down and urged investors not to buy every dip and wait for real opportunities. The analyst made some specific predictions about the market bottom: \u201cStill think it\u2019s not over. I think you know probably across the board it\u2019s another 15% to go to the downside. Look, the top wasn\u2019t that difficult to call. It really wasn\u2019t. And I think the bottom, typically on these major trends when they roll over, they do the same thing. They mean revert to fair value, which is a fancy way of saying that the market should drop down to where most of the trade activity has taken place on the major trend, which is the rally off the March 2020 lows.\u201d Strazzullo thinks the S&P 500 could fall to 4,500 to 4,100 before seeing a bottom. He repeatedly said during the interview that the market\u2019s gains from the pandemic days are \u201ctapped out.\u201d \u201cThe key driver here was the rally off the March 2020 lows in the height of the pandemic when we knew we were going to get historic monetary and fiscal stimulus. If you knew that, that was the right trend, you could have known months in advance when the market was going to top out. I gave the targets months in advance. If you missed this fundamentally or technically, you were asleep at the switch.\u201d READ ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article, we picked 10 stocks Wall Street is closely watching amid the US-China trade war. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jim Cramer in a program earlier in April said that he\u2019s \u201cnot selling\u201d NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) because he still believes AI demand is strong. \u201cNvidia.. okay now listen to me for a second listen to me it\u2019s down another 7% today it\u2019s horrendous I\u2019ve been saying that right is that if I hit that from you why Nvidia because the White House blessed its goods that are made Taiwan with no tariff to import and yet few noticed I know there\u2019s a widespread belief that we\u2019re seeing a slackening in demand for AI infrastructure all I can tell you is that I monitor this thing like a hawk and there hasn\u2019t been a slackening it\u2019s been in total acceleration move but nobody cares and I know it\u2019s headed lower but at least you know why I\u2019m not selling.\u201d The market will keep punishing Nvidia for not coming up to its gigantic (and sometimes unrealistic) growth expectations. About 50% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from large cloud providers, which are rethinking their plans amid the DeepSeek launch and looking for low-cost chips. Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC\u2019s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia\u2019s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses\u00a0 TSMC\u2019s 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offers alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: \u201cNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance due to several factors. In January 2025, investor concerns grew regarding the emergence of advanced AI models from China, reportedly developed at lower costs and with reduced computing requirements, raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s market dominance. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of new tariffs targeting industries increased worries about higher operational costs. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia reported robust fiscal fourth-quarter results, highlighted by significant revenue growth driven by its data center segment. On the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the increasing computational requirements of future AI models, noting, \u201cThe more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer,\u201d and adding that future reasoning models could demand substantially more compute resources. We believe Nvidia\u2019s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure\u2014including advancements in inference and reasoning during inference\u2014continues to drive adoption among enterprises and startups, ensuring sustained demand for its high performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed and new clusters deployed, we see Nvidia as well-positioned to capitalize on rising computational needs across AI applications.\u201d Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of stocks to watch as trade wars begin. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The Wall Street Journal also said Huawei is set to ship more than 800,000 Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers, including state-owned telecommunications carriers and AI developers such as TikTok parent ByteDance. Read more about Nvidias stock moves and today's market action. Nvidia stock spiraledafter the chipmaker disclosed ina regulatory filingthis month that the US government had effectively banned exports of its H20 chips made specifically for the Chinese market to comply with ever-tightening US trade rules. The company said it would record a $5.5 billion loss from the policy change, with JPMorgan analystsestimating the ban would shave up to $16 billion from Nvidia's revenuethis year. China accounted for $17 billion, or 13%, of Nvidia's revenue in its fiscal year 2025, Bernstein noted earlier this month. DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria estimates that share could be higher, telling Yahoo Finance in an email that as much as 40% of Nvidia's revenue comes from China due tochip smuggling. Nvidia stock dropped last weekafter Reuters reported that Huawei's 910C chips are set to begin shipping as soon as May and are reportedly competitive with Nvidia's H100 chips. Those Nvidia chips were banned from sale to China in 2022 and are two iterations behind Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips. Nvidia stock is down more than 17% in 2025, as the leading AI chip stock has suffered from investor scrutiny over AI spending from Big Tech giants andTrump's trade war. Earlier this month,the US government said it is probing Nvidiaover the use of its AI chips in China. Meanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang visited China andmet with trade officials. The company is simultaneously looking to expand its domestic manufacturing footprint,pledging $500 billionto theUS AI supply chain buildout. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Morning Brief hostsBrad SmithandMadison Millstake a look at some of the top trending stories of the trading day so far. Nvidia (NVDA) is in focus as Chinese competitor Huawei isreportedlypreparing a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip that could replace some Nvidia products. Domino's (DPZ) missed first quarter revenue estimates on weaker US same-store sales. IBM (IBM) has announced plans to invest $150 billion in the US over the next five years to boost the company's role in computing. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere. Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We're watching Nvidia, Domino's, and IBM. First up, Nvidia facing increasing competition from China's Huawei. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Chinese tech giant is preparing to test its new AI chip with hopes that it could replace some higher end Nvidia products. Shares of Nvidia, of course, the poster child of the AI semiconductor and chip trade. You're seeing that move lower here, really pre-market by about 1% here as we inch closer to the beginning of today's trading session. Yeah, this is a big deal, guys. This could potentially be Huawei's most powerful AI chip yet. And also, according to some sources cited by the Wall Street Journal, this Huawei 910D chip could potentially surpass Nvidia's 2022 launched H100 in terms of AI performance. So, this highlights something that we've been covering a lot, this idea of whether or not export controls start to negatively impact some of these companies like an Nvidia, where you start to see out performers in other regions. In this case, of course, that out performer potentially being Huawei. Also talking about here in some of the analyst commentary reacting to this news, the resilience of China's semiconductor sector, despite those export controls, again, highlighting the negative impact those export controls could potentially have on some of these names like Nvidia. We also know from the reporting that Huawei has started approaching Chinese firms to conduct tests on these chips that they are offering potentially moving forward as well. Well, next up, Domino's pizza missing first quarter revenue estimates hit by a decline in US same store sales. Still, international same store sales rose 3.7% helping to offset the US decline. Those shares down about 1 and a half percent. Really interesting here because Domino's is one of those companies people talk about as a recession indicator, and they say that actually, if we are heading toward a downturn, you might see an increase in sales because pizza, that can be one of your like little luxuries, your little treats. That's not what we saw in the data, but the company saying that this is about a slowdown in the consumer, and that that is why they did have a little bit of that decline here in revenue. Yeah, a little into the numbers here for Domino's. Revenues increased 12 or $27.4 million or 2 and a half percent in the first quarter of 2025. One of the things that that comes back to is how they look across their advertising business in the US franchise advertising revenues. They actually increased primarily, they say as a result of a decrease in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions, plus the return to the standard 6% advertising contribution rate at the beginning of the second quarter of 2024. And so, that in mind, the increase partially offset by the transitioning of some of their equipment, some of their supplies, ultimately to a third-party seller there. So, that's just a little bit into the increase in revenue that they were discussing here. And the company's CEO, Russ Weiner, saying that the results demonstrate that their hungry for more strategy continues to drive market share growth in QSR, quick service restaurant pizza across both their US and international businesses. Love it. We got plenty of good pizza options here in New York. Exactly. That is true. That is very true. Any with the grandma slice. All right, finally here, IBM announcing plans to invest a $150 billion figure in America over the next 5 years to accelerate its role in computing. The company's CEO saying the investment ensures that IBM, quote, remains the epicenter of the world's most advanced computing and AI capabilities. Shares of IBM higher pre-market by about 4/10 of a percent. I imagine that every time this company hears generative AI or AI, and it being some type of new phenomenon, they're just saying, \"Well, hold my beer. Have you guys heard of Watson?\" Because, since we've been in high school, essentially, you've heard and seen them really pounding the pavement about some of their super computing, and how they can really dovetail that into so many different elements that have had different hype cycles and waves, whether that be in cryptocurrency and blockchain, whether that's been in AI in itself. And so, those have been some of the strategic imperatives that the companies have talked, this company has talked about over years now, for the past seven, eight years. And so, now really just trying to invest even further in some of those initiatives. Yeah, and let's talk about the the news of day here. Great to give that context, Brad. In terms of IBM investing in America here, you can see the comparisons with other tech companies here. Nvidia and Apple both investing up to $500 billion in the United States over the next 4 years according to their proposals. Now, IBM becoming the latest tech company with US investment plans here. This is part of what the Trump administration has been touting off the back of their tariff announcements, the idea that it will lead to an increase in companies investing in the United States. And now, the companies that are putting forward that investment, perhaps supporting that idea here. Really quickly, want to mention this investment includes $30 billion in R&D, focusing on none other than quantum computer manufacturing. We also heard that from Nvidia.

        "content": "Tech stocks face a pivotal week as Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) gear up to report earnings. T. Rowe Price global technology fund portfolio manager Dominic Rizzo joins Morning Brief to share why he's cautiously optimistic and what fundamentals he'll be watching from earnings across the Magnificent Seven. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere. It's time now for today's strategy session. Four of the magnificent seven stocks set to report earnings this week. Meta and Microsoft due out Tuesday, Amazon and Apple set to report Thursday. Joining us now, we've got Dominic Rizzo, who is the T-Ro Price Global Technology Fund portfolio manager. Great to have you here with us. So, I just want to get your expectations and the tone you're expecting from some of these magnificent seven names, these components reporting this week. Well, first off, great to be back, guys. Um, and, you know, when I'm looking at these mag7 names, and frankly, when I'm looking at the broader technology universe, I'm cautiously optimistic heading into this week. You know, what we saw the last couple weeks of earnings is relative strength across software, semis, internet, and I think that will kind of extend into these mag7 names as they're coming up. Um, but it's really all going to come down to fundamentals. I thought the last spot right around where we are from a technical basis is a really great point. You know, this, this week's really going to determine whether or not last week was just a bear, bear market rally or the start of a new, uh, a new bull market acceleration. And I'm, I'm cautiously optimistic that we're going to remain in that bull market. It's, it's interesting, Dominic, because I was having a conversation with a source over the weekend who talks to a lot of CEOs, and the source was telling me that sometimes CEOs are incentivized to give perhaps a little bit more optimistic picture than is the reality on earnings calls because of the way that analysts will ding them if they don't. So how much can you trust the story that is spun on these earnings calls, especially for the tech names where expectations are so sky high? Well, you know, if I look at the global technology universe, I actually think expectations have come down quite a bit from where they were in February, right? So if we look at the global technology universe, it's trading at roughly 20 to 21 times earnings today. That peaked in February at 27 and 28 times earnings. And because of the volatility that we saw in April, right? I, where expectations exactly are is actually pretty tough to, to gauge heading into this week. But, you know, if we look at valuations, I think they're relatively reasonable, and again, we're at that 20 times level. Historically, we've kind of bottomed out mid-teens, and we would see a good time to sell in 27 to 28. So I, I, I think they're relatively okay heading into this week. In terms of how CEOs communicate on their, their stock earnings calls, I mean, I think the great thing about the stock market is it's impossible to trick, right? You know, the mar, the market is able to tell if, if things are getting better or worse, or we're going to see accelerating fundamentals or decelerating fundamentals. Um, and I think that that's what we saw all last week, right? Take, take a look the analog semiconductor names. Um, the companies called the Q1 bottom, and the market believed them. And, and, and, and I think we're going to see some strong follow-through in those names.",

But if this is money that you're counting on to be your retirement income, your long-term savings, you don't want try to to time something that's not timed,\" Patterson told me on Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bidpodcast (video above; listen in below). \"President Trump's posts are not timed. How these deals play out or not is not timed. So you're basically just gambling. And that is not how you save for the long term.\" Patterson is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. She's also an independent director at Vanguard, the global asset manager with more than $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM). She was previously the chief investment strategist atBridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund. Patterson explained, \"If this is longer-term-oriented money, then I would make sure that a good chunk of it is in something that you're just sitting on, that you're not trying to go up and down and tactically trade. That might be money markets, short-term bonds right now, which are still getting you over 4%. It might be a small allocation to gold, which I remain bullish on as central banks continue to diversify.

        "header": "How To Start a Successful Dropshipping Business: A Comprehensive Guide",
        "content": "If you're looking for a way to earn some extra cash while working from home, dropshipping could be an option for you, though it's not without it challenges. Dropshipping involves partnering with a third-party supplier to ship products and goods directly to customers. Unlike a traditional retailer, you don't have to worry about manufacturing products, keeping inventory in stock, or leasing out a retail space. While influencers on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, tout dropshipping as a way to get rich quick, building a successful dropshipping business\u2014like developing any othere-commercesite\u2013can take time, effort, and a willingness to expand your knowledge. Dropshippers essentially make money by being middlemen. A dropshipper will buy an item from a vendor at a certain price point and then turn around and sell it for more to a customer, while pocketing the difference. Here\u2019s an example: A customer purchases an item from a dropshipper\u2019s store for $25. The dropshipper then purchases that item from a third-party vendor for $10. The vendor then ships the product directly to the customer, and the dropshipper profits $15 from that transaction, excluding other expenses like shipping costs. Some e-commerce platforms even allow dropshippers to link their store directly to the third-party vendors. This means that any new purchases are automatically sent to the vendor, streamlining the process. One of the most important steps in creating a successful dropshipping business is choosing the right products. In order to turn a profit, you\u2019ll want to choose products that will be appealing to potential customers. You may consider doingmarket research, which involves gathering information on possible customers, determining if there\u2019s a need or want for the products you want to offer, and identifying competitors. By analyzing competitors, you can get an idea of what prices you should charge or if the market for a particular product is oversaturated, meaning there\u2019s less consumer demand for that product. Lastly, you\u2019ll want to determine what third-party vendors you\u2019ll rely on forinventory. If you plan to use a supplier located abroad, look into the cost of any potentialduties,tariffs, or fees that may be charged for shipping goods to the U.S.. You'll want to factor those costs into the price you\u2019ll ultimately charge for the products you sell. To open an online store, you\u2019ll first need to find an e-commerce platform that suits your needs. You\u2019ll want to ask yourself a few questions when evaluating different platforms: After you\u2019ve determined which platform is right for you, the work has just begun. You\u2019ll need to create a digital storefront and make listings for all the products you plan to offer. Whenever you create your listings, make sure to include multiple high-quality images of the product and a specific, yet concise description of the product. After you open a digital storefront, you'll want to focus on marketing your business online.Social mediaplatforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X are free to join, but if you want to advertise on these platforms, you'll typically need to pay extra. Additionally, you may want to rely on your network to help boost your business's profile. For example, if you know anyone with lots of followers, you may consider asking them to post about your store and provide them with affiliate links so they get a kickback. Another important marketing tool you may want to use issearch engine optimization (SEO). When you're designing your store, make sure to include certain keywords or phrases that potential customers search for when looking for businesses or stores that sell products like yours. Building a successful dropshipping business can be challenging because the market can be competitive, and it may be hard to stand out from businesses selling similar items. While dropshipping involves purchasing cheap products from abroad, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on certain foreign goods imported to the U.S. will likely make it harder to launch a new business, as those tariffs will drive up the cost of goods. Theelimination of an important trade loopholecould raise costs dramatically, too. The Trump administration has announced that it will eliminate the \"de minimis exemption\" on packages from China and Hong Kong. This exemption, which allowed foreign companies to ship small-value packages (worth less than $800) to the U.S. without paying duties or fees, will expire on May 2. On May 2, the per postal item fee for packages shipped directly from China will be $100, rising to $200 on June 1.Dropshippers may find that potential customers have little appetite for their goods when products aren't so cheap anymore. Dropshipping can be a flexible way to earn money from home, but it requires careful planning. While it may be promoted as a way to get rich quickly, building a sustainable business takes time and effort. Yet dropshipping businesses may soon face headwinds due to increasing tariffs and changes to trade rules, which could shrink profit margins and reduce consumer demand.",

Parker thinks that in the coming days, earnings reports of many companies will begin to show that we are indeed facing an economic slowdown: \u201cYou know there\u2019s a difference between a growth scare and and then an actual growth slowdown I think in this case it is a growth slowdown I don\u2019t know how much of it is yet and that\u2019s where I think the challenge is but you can\u2019t just say oh it\u2019s an irrational growth scare that everyone has and it\u2019s like an uncertain I think if you have a business with pricing power if you have a business that you know you can be okay. But there\u2019s a lot of economically sensitive businesses we\u2019re going to hear from next week and the week after if you think about how earning season typically unfolds where we may get guidance that isn\u2019t quite as peachy as we\u2019ve seen from you know the original guys in the banks and then some of the higher quality tech companies have reported.\u201d READ ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article, we picked 10 stocks Wall Street is currently buzzing about. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder and CEO, explained in a latest program on CNBC why NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains his top AI pick. The analyst said that the demand for the company\u2019s chips will remain strong. \u201cNvidia is still our top AI pick. And I know that that is probably at this point exhausting to hear. The stock has not worked this year. It really hasn\u2019t worked the last 6 months. But I think if you look at the bottom line, 21 times forward earnings, I think those earnings are pretty solid. We\u2019ve derisked the China issue now with the H20 ban. And I don\u2019t think that the hyperscalers, no matter what happens in the economy, are going to stop spending on Nvidia chips. So that is still the name that our models are sticking with.\u201d Answering a question about the potential impact of price declines of chips, the analyst said that the use cases for the AI technology will increase over time: \u201cThis happens always in tech, right? Prices come down and the ability of whether it\u2019s software or hardware improves over time. That\u2019s the story of technology. But I think the other side of the AI bull market is really what is the consumer side, what is the enterprise side for demand for these products. And what we\u2019re seeing over the last 3 months \u2014 and I don\u2019t think this is being reflected in stocks at all \u2014 is that there is huge demand for these products. And I think it\u2019sre increasing and even accelerating with the 03 model launched last week from Open AI. You have Grok from xAI. You have Gemini\u2019s new model from Google. All three of them have said they have capacity constraints in terms of what they can serve to customers right now. I think the demand will be there to force more chip buying even if prices do come down.\u201d Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: \u201cNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance due to several factors. In January 2025, investor concerns grew regarding the emergence of advanced AI models from China, reportedly developed at lower costs and with reduced computing requirements, raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s market dominance. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of new tariffs targeting industries increased worries about higher operational costs. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia reported robust fiscal fourth-quarter results, highlighted by significant revenue growth driven by its data center segment. On the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the increasing computational requirements of future AI models, noting, \u201cThe more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer,\u201d and adding that future reasoning models could demand substantially more compute resources. We believe Nvidia\u2019s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure\u2014including advancements in inference and reasoning during inference\u2014continues to drive adoption among enterprises and startups, ensuring sustained demand for its high performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed and new clusters deployed, we see Nvidia as well-positioned to capitalize on rising computational needs across AI applications.\u201d Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of top stocks to watch as investors brace for recession. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thischeapest AI stock.

        "content": "Former Intel (INTC,Financials) CEO Pat Gelsinger said Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)secured its leadershipin artificial intelligence chips by executing well and building strong competitive defenses. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC. In an interview with Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bid, Gelsinger credited Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang with keeping the company ahead of rivals by pushing teams to stay at the cutting edge. He said Nvidia's advantage comes from a combination of strong execution and \"meaningful moats\" that protect its position in the fast-growing AI market. Nvidia's technologies like NVLink, which links GPUs within servers, and CUDA, a platform that speeds up computing workloads, were cited by Gelsinger as key examples of those moats. He noted that investment from large corporations and a surge of AI startups particularly in the Bay Area have accelerated demand for AI chips. \"I can't throw a rock right without hitting a new AI startup in the Bay Area,\" Gelsinger said. While Nvidia has gained momentum, Intel has struggled. Once a dominant force in Silicon Valley, Intel missed major industry shifts such as the rise of mobile and AI. The company's stock fell nearly 50% in 2024, prompting layoffs and buyouts during Gelsinger's tenure. Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, who took over in March, acknowledged the company had been \"too slow to adapt\" and pledged to rebuild trust with customers. Intel's stock has dropped another 22% over the past month. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "Chinese tech company Huawei is reportedly working on a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip to compete with Nvidia (NVDA),according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal. Morningstar equity strategist Brian Colello joins Catalysts withMadison Millsto dive deeper into the report and what it means for US chip giant Nvidia. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere. Shares of Nvidia are down a little over 2% after news the Chinese company Huawei is developing an AI chip it believes can compete with Nvidia's H100. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. For a closer look at the chip sector, I want to bring in Brian Colello. He is Morningstar's equity strategist. Brian, great to speak with you this morning. Talk to me about this potential competition coming in from China, specifically Huawei here. To what extent is that a real headwind for Nvidia? Oh, I think the headwind is in place and I think it's pretty much game over for Nvidia in China. I think the ban of the H200 was probably the final straw of Nvidia being able to sell anything halfway decent into China, and I would expect that Huawei's products will probably be uh higher quality than uh the older products that Nvidia has been shipping or the H200 uh, if not today, then at some point in the new few in the near future. So I do think Nvidia is pretty much cut off, and and I do think of Nvidia from here on out is much more of a uh developed market story. There's still plenty of growth in the US, Europe, um so I I'm much more focused on on those markets at this point. Brian, I had to check the transcript when I sat down in my new seat over here to make sure I heard you correctly. You are very bearish Nvidia China business specifically off the back of this news. What do you think that initiates for Nvidia? Do you think they potentially spin off the China business at some point, or do you think they just cut their losses and invest in other markets? Well, I I think they already have a five and a half billion dollar write-off, and we'll hear from them more in in late May, so maybe, you know, it's possible. Maybe there's something they will be shipping, um, but I I think the restrictions have cut the materiality of of the China business in steps, and I think this H200 uh cut and the five and a half billion write-off is um as close to the final straw as I could think of. I think they just walk away and focus on the US. And talk to me as As long as um as long as they can, I mean, there's if the restrictions get lifted, Nvidia would love to be back there, but I I just don't think the US uh government will let them, quite frankly. So then, what does that mean for American investors, especially as we do head towards those Nvidia earnings? Do you think that there is still a bull case for this name in the short term? Absolutely. I think Nvidia is still selling everything they can make on the Grace Blackwell side. Um there's still tremendous growth from the hyperscalers, Google, Microsoft, etc. We're seeing few signs, if any, that they're really slowing spending in 2025. It seems like they're buying all the Blackwells they can for this year because of the performance improvements, and we're still skeptical that US companies are going to slow down their AI investments, even with the recession. AI is the future. It is uh certainly a race right now, uh and we think that spending continues in the short term. So I think Nvidia is set up. Now, China uh could be a hit, so maybe we do see um, you know, less earnings growth this year, less revenue growth, I maybe even revenues down quarter over quarter because of the big China hit. We'll see on that, but everything else should be pretty good, and there's still a lot to be bullish about for the US and AI in the future.",

        "header": "4 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Wall Street has seen significant volatility in 2025, triggered by fears of a potential recession and new rounds of tariff wars. However, this market turmoil can also offer an opportunity to quietly compound your long-term wealth. If you look beyond the daily panic, you will notice a few companies that are demonstrating healthy top-line growth while maintaining substantial competitive moats in their respective markets. Here's whyNvidia(NVDA-3.83%),Microsoft(MSFT-1.08%),Super Micro Computer(SMCI-0.63%), andServiceNow(NOW-1.43%)are worth buying and holding for the long run. At the time of this writing, shares of Nvidia are down nearly 31% from their January peak. Yet the business has not weakened. It is still going strong. The company's recently launched Blackwell chips represent a dramatic leap in artificial intelligence (AI) computing capabilities. Compared to previous Hopper architecture chips, they deliver impressive performance at a much lower cost when handling large inferencing AI workloads. This means faster results and lower client costs, translating into high enterprise demand. Blackwell has already generated over $11 billion in revenue during the most recent quarter. Nvidia has also evolved from a gaming-focused chip player to a full-stack AI infrastructure giant, with a robust software ecosystem and networking infrastructure. The company is also focusing on upcoming AI opportunities in areas like agentic AI, physical AI, and autonomous driving. Not surprisingly,Bank of Americaanalysts see the company's addressable AI infrastructure market reach at around $2 trillion. Nvidia is still in the early stages of capitalizing on this tremendous opportunity. Microsoft has also emerged as a dominant AI player and is already monetizing its AI assets. Microsoft's primary profit driver, the Azure cloud computing platform, continues to be a major growth catalyst. Recently, however, Azure AI infrastructure services have been pivotal in attracting developers, businesses, and enterprises to the Azure ecosystem. The company's AI-powered Copilot assistant, integrated across several of its flagship offerings, is also a very promising AI initiative. Copilot is helping attract new customers and increase usage frequency among large enterprises. The company is also at the forefront of the next-generation quantum computing technology, with initiatives such as the Majorana 1 chip and advances in quantum virtualization software. Microsoft also differentiates itself from several of its peers based on its robust financial structure. The company's mostly subscription-based diversified business model is a significant strength in the current volatile environment. And here's where it gets interesting: Even with all this momentum, the company is trading at 25.9 timesforward earnings-- below its five-year average of 33 times. That disconnect may not last long. But it offers a smart opportunity to pick up this stock now. Super Micro Computer's leading position in the AI server market and its dominance in liquid cooling technology have made it a significant beneficiary of the explosive demand in the global AI infrastructure market, estimated to be over $200 billion by 2028. Super Micro Computer lowered its guidance for fiscal 2025 but remains confident about reaching $40 billion  in revenues in fiscal 2026, implying around 65% year-over-year growth from its current-year forecasts. The company expects strong demand for air-cooled and liquid-cooled AI configurations, equipped with Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs. Super Micro Computer is also working on increasing manufacturing capacity at its U.S., Taiwan, and Malaysia sites. Since utilization is just 55% in the U.S., 60% in Taiwan, and only 1% in Malaysia, there is a lot of room to grow. Although the company faces multiple challenges, including margin pressures, intensifying competition, and damaged investor trust due to historical compliance and governance issues, there is still much to like about this stock. ServiceNow's cloud-based digital workflow automation platform, known as the Now platform, has positioned the company as a key beneficiary of the growing adoption of digitization across enterprises. The company's software solutions are used to automate and streamline technology, CRM, industry, core business, and creator workflows across industry verticals such as healthcare, manufacturing, and the U.S. public sector. Thanks to the diversified business model, the company is not overtly reliant on any particular industry or workflow. ServiceNow has delivered impressive financial performance, with subscription revenues rising 20%  year over year and current remaining performance obligations (the current portion of future revenue backlog) growing 22% year over year in the recent quarter (first quarter fiscal 2025 ending March 31, 2025). The company's AI initiatives are also gaining momentum. This is evident since the number of ServiceNow Pro Plus deals (which offer advanced generative AI capabilities integrated into the Now Assist suite) more than quadrupled year over year in the first quarter. The company's next-generation AI-optimized database, RaptorDB, also gained traction and won five deals over $1 million. Finally, the company's planned acquisitions, Moveworks and Logik.ai, are further expected to strengthen its AI capabilities. ServiceNow is trading at a forward P/E of 47.8, which is not cheap. However, the stock seems a worthwhile buy now considering its robust fundamentals and the valuation, which is dramatically lower than its five-year average of 235.2 times.",

Below, we take a closer look at Meta\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify price levels that investors may be eyeing. Meta shares have forged two closely aligned troughs during April, potentially setting the stage for adouble bottom, a chart pattern that indicates a bullish reversal. More recently, the stock has undergone a pre-earnings bounce, with the price forming adojiin Friday\u2019s trading session to signal indecision among buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, therelative strength index (RSI)points to neutral conditions, providing a reading around the 50 threshold. Let\u2019s identify several importantsupport and resistancelevels on Meta's chart. Investors should initially keep track of the $482 level. Apullbackto this area would likely attract buying interest near the prominent April troughs that form the potential double bottom pattern. It\u2019s worth pointing out that this location also sits in the same neighborhood as the 38.2%Fibonacci retirement levelwhen applying a grid from the February high to April low. Selling below this key level could see the shares retreat to around $452. This area may provide support nearswing lowsthat developed on retracementstoward the 200-day moving averagein July and August last year. A pre-earnings bump could trigger buying to the $588 level. Investors may view this area as a high probability location to lock in profitsnear a trendline that links the early-Aprilcountertrendrally with a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to December last year. Finally, a close above this level would confirm the double bottom pattern and potentially spark a move up to $632. Meta shares may run into overhead selling pressure in this region near multiplepeaksthat formed on the chart between December and March.

        "content": "We recently published a list of10 Stocks Everyone\u2019s Talking About as Trump Softens His Tone on China. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks everyone\u2019s talking about as Trump softens his tone on China. Investors are desperately looking for signs of a market bottom after going through massive volatility and losses. 3Fourteen Research\u2019s Warren Pies said in a latest program on CNBC that we are getting \u201cclose\u201d to a market bottom based on his technical analysis. The analyst talked about key indicators he\u2019s looking for: \u201cI do think that the White House is trying to deescalate the situation. One of the markers we\u2019ve seen is that Peter Navarro hasn\u2019t been on TV since April 13th, and that\u2019s corresponding with this equity rally. Setting that aside, though, I think that a bottom, a confirmed bottom, has two components. You need to see washed out sentiment and positioning. We measured that in a number of ways: we measured it in inverse ETFs for retail, we measured it for vault targeting for institutions, and CTAs for trend followers. Across all those metrics, sentiment is depressed. That\u2019s phase one of a bottom. Then, you look for technical confirmation. Philosophically, we\u2019re always going to be late because of that ordering.\u201d READ ALSO7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks investors are currently focusing on. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Funds Investors: 193 Bernstein\u2019s Stacy Rasgon said in a latest program on CNBC that the demand is still strong for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the company despite concerns in the industry: \u201cI mean,\u00a0 that is sort of the big question. I would say right now, at least the demand environment still looks really, really strong. Just to pick on Nvidia, like I think they\u2019re going to sell everything that they can get out the door this year. So that that just becomes the question, how much can they get out the door? You know, but at this point, I would say like the only ones that really seem to be worried about the AI-like demand environment seem to be investors. Like the companies that are actually doing the spending right now, their capex forecasts and requirements and everything, they\u2019re going up, not down.\u201d The market will keep punishing Nvidia for not coming up to its gigantic (and sometimes unrealistic) growth expectations. About 50% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from large cloud providers, which are rethinking their plans amid the DeepSeek launch and looking for low-cost chips. Nvidia\u2019s Q1 guidance shows a 9.4% QoQ revenue growth, down from the previous 12% QoQ growth. Its adjusted margin is expected to be down substantially as well to 71%. The market does not like it when Nvidia fails to post a strong quarterly beat. The stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters when the company will report unimpressive growth. Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC\u2019s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia\u2019s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses\u00a0 TSMC\u2019s 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offers alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node. Harding Loevner Global Developed Markets Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter: \u201cFor the full year, the composite\u2019s underperformance was primarily due to poor stock choices in the US.NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), which we sold in the first quarter and repurchased in the fourth quarter, caused almost two-thirds of the strategy\u2019s underperformance. We were hurt by our underweight as NVIDIA\u2019s stock price soared during the first half of the year on the insatiable demand for the company\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), which enable generative Al computing. Overall, NVDAranks 4thon our list of best mid cap growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Nscale, a London-based startup founded just 11 months ago, ismovingaggressively to capitalize on the AI boom. The company is seeking to raise about $2.7 billion to build global data centers powered by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips, according to offering documents seen by Bloomberg. The proposed financing package includes a $1.8 billion private credit deal led by Goldman Sachs and another $900 million in preferred equity and convertible shares. Nscale's management is betting that surging AI infrastructure demand will support rapid growth, even as recent market volatility tied to Trump's new tariff measures poses fresh headwinds. Discussions with investors began before the latest financial shocks, and plans may evolve depending on market conditions. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. A key part of Nscale's strategy hinges on an expected $2 billion contract with ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, which would rent high-end Nvidia GB200 chips installed at Nscale facilities in Norway. ByteDance has acknowledged discussions but indicated the size of the deal may be overstated. Nevertheless, the arrangement highlights a growing trend where Chinese tech companies bypass U.S. chip restrictions by leasing compute power abroad. To strengthen its case with lenders, Nscale is offering collateralized loans backed by Nvidia chips, data center leases, and customer contracts, aiming for a spread even tighter than recent private deals in the AI space. Pricing remains in flux, but the structure could offer investors a compelling risk-reward profile if demand holds up. Still, concerns are building about whether the AI infrastructure rush can sustain its current pace. Nscale's nearest rival, Coreweave, recently scaled back its IPO plans after investor enthusiasm cooled, and Nscale's current operational capacity about 40 megawatts across Norway and Texas remains much smaller than Coreweave's 360 megawatts. Nscale, founded by energy entrepreneur Josh Payne and backed by Sandton Capital Partners following a $155 million Series A, is now racing against time. With five new sites in the pipeline and mounting scrutiny on AI spending, the company's ability to execute swiftly and lock in anchor customers like ByteDance will be critical to determining whether it becomes a major new player or just another ambitious AI story that burned bright and faded fast.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped alongside the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ahead of a packed week of Big Tech earnings. NVIDIA shares slid about 4%, while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) edged down roughly 2%. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) each dipped near 2%. Reports over the weekend indicate Huawei has begun lining up Chinese partners to test its Ascend 910D AI processor. Last week, Huawei said it plans to start mass shipments of the Ascend 910C chip domestically as soon as next month. New U.S. export curbs now force NVIDIA to secure a license before shipping its H20 AI accelerators to China, a restriction that could shave as much as $5.5 billion from NVIDIA's revenue, analysts warn. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell about 3%, while Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) each dropped roughly 3% and 2%, respectively.

        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-1.07%)stock is declining in Monday's trading following potentially significant news about competitive dynamics in the semiconductor industry. The company's share price was down 1.4% as of 3:30 p.m. ET and had been off as much as 2.8% earlier in the session. TSMC's valuation is moving lower today following news that Chinese tech giant Huawei is testing an artificial intelligence (AI) chip that could rivalNvidia's top semiconductors. Nvidia relies on TSMC to fabricate its semiconductor designs, and both companies occupy key positions in the broader AI hardware and tech race between the U.S. and China. Restrictions put in place by the U.S. officially bar Nvidia's high-end processors and advanced chips manufactured by TSMC from being sold into the Chinese market, but Huawei could be poised to give China a major step forward in the AI race with its new Ascend 910D processor. The Wall Street Journalrecently reported that Huawei is teaming up with tech-industry partners to test the new chip. Huawei reportedly expects the performance of the Ascend 910D to exceed that of Nvidia's H100 processor. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Huawei could be ready to begin shipping its Ascend 910C AI processor to customers in May. Huawei's new chip designs are being fabricated by Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC) -- China's largest chip foundry. If SMIC is able to deliver strong production yields on chip designs from Huawei that match or exceed some of Nvidia's powerful AI processors, it would mark a major shakeup in the AI market. While the H100 chip isn't Nvidia's strongest AI hardware, it's still a very powerful chip, suitable for a wide range of applications. TSMC still retains a significant lead when it comes to advanced chip foundry services, but investors will be watching closely to see if SMIC is catching up.",

Nvidia (NVDA) shares fall after areport fromThe Wall Street Journalthat Chinese tech company Huawei is making a rivaling AI chip amid US President Trump's tariffs. Coinbase Global (COIN) falls after Compass Point analysts downgrade the stock on earnings concerns. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) reports mixed first quarter results. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We're checking in on shares of Nvidia, Coinbase, and Domino's Pizza. Let's start with that magnificent seven darling Nvidia. Shares falling today after The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese Huawei is reportedly testing a new artificial intelligence chip to rival Nvidia's. Now, to be clear here, this is not a chip that's going to rival Blackwell, for example, the most advanced chips that Nvidia sells, that it can't sell in China anyway. It's more targeted at the H120, which is the most recent chip that the US has said that Nvidia is not able to sell there. Yeah. Journal citing sources saying here, uh, that Huawei's approached some Chinese companies about testing. It sounds like the fizz feasibility of the new chip. Uh, paper says it's still early stages here, more tests will be required to assess performance, get it ready for customers. China accounted for about 13% of Nvidia's revenue in its fiscal year '25. That's per analyst. Stock is down about 20% this year. Of course, most of that, we were just talking for Tom about this, is, is a lot due to investors raising just questions about AI spending now and ahead, and how that would impact names like Nvidia. Right. Yeah, that's definitely part of it. Shares of Coinbase, meanwhile, are getting hit today. That's on the back of a double downgrade from Compass Point, lowering the stock from buy to sell, citing concerns ahead of the company's upcoming first-quarter earnings results. That's on May 8th. Um, so Compass Point Research does do the double downgrade. They skip hold. They go to the sell, concerned about second-half performance as growth comes from lower-margin institutional segments, they said, and also noted, uh, decentralized exchanges could take market share among retail traders, they argue. Target 180. Something else I found intriguing here is they said that Coinbase is losing its status as the only pure-play non-BTC crypto stock. They seem to have, the folks at Compass Point, a little bit more, uh, be in the Bitcoin maximalist camp, and so they actually like, um, strategy, AKA MicroStrategy, um, because they've a buy on that and they're recommending a sell on coin sort of a pair trade if you will on the two of these. They say we believe this trade replicates the Bitcoin dominance trade. So, interesting flavor there as well. Mhm. Coin shares, they say have reacted negatively to its three most recent earnings results. Told clients we expect this streak to continue after disappointing Q1 results and second quarter commentary. Yes, so we'll see what they say on May 8th. And lastly, we've got Domino's Pizza in focus today. That company reported mixed results in its first quarter with revenue narrowly missing while profit topped expectations. The pizza giant reaffirming full-year guidance emphasizing global expansion to navigate the ongoing US consumer caution. The shares up right now. They've been kind of bouncing around in a narrow range here today, because, you know, they're kind of playing a wait-and-see, it looks like. Yeah. Bloomberg analyst chiming in too here. They said 2025 US same-store sales guidance of 3% may be achievable. They talk about DoorDash partnership, stuffed crust pizza, and greater loyalty member sales will be partly offset, they talk about, by soft low-income consumer spending. Mhm. Um, international same-store sales, by the way, were stronger in the quarter than they were, um, in the US. They beat analysts estimates. But we saw in the US same-store sales were down by a half a percent. I saw that. Yeah. To the extent that you were getting nervous about the economy and your pocketbook, so I would think people would be like, okay, maybe I'll skip the steak and I'll head to a Domino's. Or maybe they're cooking at home now. Oh, you just threw it all at home. Yeah.",

        "content": "Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response toPresident Trump's tariffs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses. Wall Street is coming off arebounding runlast week. The gains came as Trumpeased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted atlight at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"up to China\" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step. Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX). Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's \"core\" expenses.

Every now and then economists will start mentioning a less followed economic data point as key to the current market narrative. Right now, as everyone patiently waits for the dour sentiment data to turn into actually bad readings on economic activity, economists are increasingly talking about shipments at the Port of Los Angeles. As our Chart of the Day shows, Incoming shipments to the Port of Los Angeles are expected tobe roughly 36% lower than the previous year in the week ending May 10. While other key indicators of an economic slowdown, like weekly filings for unemployment benefits, haven't ticked up yet, RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas told Yahoo Finance he's been watching the activity at the Port of Los Angeles. Brusuelas noted that the decline in activity is one of the first signs that US economic growth is set to cool. \"In June, what that means is there'll be less goods on the shelves.\" Brusuelas said. \"Less goods equals higher prices. At a time when inflation goes up, that means less disposable income, less demand.\" Read more here. Crude prices tumbled more than 2% on Monday as economic uncertainty and worries of extra supply from OPEC weighed on the market. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the US benchmark, hovered near $61 per barrel on Monday. Brent (BZ=F) crude oil, the international benchmark, sat below $65 a barrel. Futures were under pressure as the trade war between the US and China showed no further developent of easing. However, Trump administration officials have signaled they are negotiating with different countries on tariffs. Meanwhile US negotiations with oil producer Iran over its nuclear program, and worries of accelerating output hikes by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies (OPEC+) has also put pressure on futures. \"Crude sentiment has turned more bearish since our forecast last month with OPEC+s more aggressive unwind \u2013 and accompanying doubts about unity within the cartel \u2013 the key change. \" said BNP Paribas analyst Aldo Spanjer wrote in a note on Monday. Gold (GC=F) prices inched higher on Monday, reversing a recent pullback. Futures gained more than 1% to hover near $3,350 per ounce. The precious metal touched an all-time high just north of $3,500 last week before tumbling amid easing trade tensions and a rallying stock market. Despite the pullback in price, most analysts are still bullish on the commodity.

Trump's tariffs continue to crush sentiment across the business and consumer worlds. New data out Monday morning from the Dallas Fed showed overall activity in its manufacturing survey fell to its lowest level since May 2020, as orders, utilization, shipments, and the outlook for business all plummeted. The Dallas Fed's survey also comes along with robust commentary from business leaders gathered by the bank's staff, which shows how the uncertainty related to tariff policy is manifesting across industries. \"There is really no way to predict anything accurately six months out or even six weeks out now for our industry due to the tariff and trade uncertainty,\" said an executive in the computer and electric manufacturing industry. \"Carve-outs for large electronics businesses (cellphones and laptops) leaves small business burdened to deal with tariffs on our own, which are likely to cause delays, cancellations and early product obsolescence on existing products and orders. We have already had to turn around and refuse shipments because customers cannot afford the tariffs, delaying our ability to build, which will eventually lead to job losses.\" In the food manufacturing industry, one executive said, \"Tariffs and tariff uncertainty are wreaking havoc on our supply lines and capital spending plans.\" But it's not only tariffs weighing on business outlooks. Another leader in food manufacturing added that, \"DOGE without a follow-up plan does nothing for the domestic tranquility needed (stable arena for business to function within).\" And a comment from a leader in the machinery manufacturing industry said it best, encapsulating most of the concerns weighing on businesses and consumers right now. \"Nothing is easy,\" this exec said. \"Forecasting is extremely challenging in this time of uncertainty. Committing to growth initiatives is anxiety-riddled. Helping our employees keep beans on their table and a roof over their heads is harder. We believe the direction the current administration is leading our country is on target, but the pain to get there may be longer and more intense than originally anticipated.\" Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Readmore here.

        "content": "Boeing (BA) shares rose Monday after the plane maker got two pieces of good news: Its stock was upgraded by Bernstein analysts, and its deal to reacquire Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (SPR) cleared another hurdle. Bernstein analysts on Sunday upgraded Boeing stock to \"outperform,\" with a price target of $218, up from $181 previously.That puts Bernstein analysts in line with eight others rating Boeing as a \"buy,\" compared with three \"hold\" ratings, according to Visible Alpha data. Their new price target is above the $196.10analyst consensus. The analysts said that after Boeing'slatest quarterly reportlast week, the company is \"now making the progress it needed for the growth trajectory we expected\" prior to the early 2024 incident in which a door plugdetached from a Boeing planein mid-flight. \"The heavy [Federal Aviation Administration] scrutiny on Boeing operations should insure a much more solid operational process at [Boeing Commercial Airplanes],\" the analysts wrote. \"Of course, this positive outlook is not without risks. But, we believe the key factors strongly outweigh the risks at this point.\" Early Monday, Spirit AeroSystems and Airbus announced an agreement for Airbus to take control of some of Spirit's operations that manufacture parts for Airbus. When Boeing announced plans to reacquire Spirit as part of its strategy to solidify the safety of itssupply chain, rival Airbus said in 2024 that it wouldtake control of certain assetsso it wasn't reliant on its largest competitor for parts. Jefferies analysts wrote Monday that the Airbus agreement \"opens the way\" for Spirit's reintegration with Boeing to close as expected, likely by the third quarter of this year. Boeing shares were up about 2% to $182 at close. Monday appears likely to be Boeing's fifth-straight winning session, a streak that has brought the stock back intopositive territoryfor the last 12 months.",

        "content": "Shares ofNvidia(NVDA-2.02%)were pulling back today as investors responded to a new threat facing the AI superstar. Just weeks after the company disclosed a write-off of as much as $5.5 billion due to new rules preventing exports of its H20 chips that were specifically designed for China, Nvidia now appears to be facing new competition out of China as Chinese tech giant Huawei is reportedly set to launch a new AI chip. As a result, Nvidia stock was down 2.6% as of 3:21 p.m. ET. Image source: Getty Images. The tech race between the U.S. and China continues to heat up asThe Wall Street Journalreported on Monday that Huawei is aiming to test it new AI chip known as the Ascend 910D, which it hopes will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100s, the prized graphics processing unit (GPU) that has driven the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. According to the report, Huawei plans to ship more than 800,000 of the new chips to customers, including state-owned telecoms and ByteDance, the parent of TikTok. The U.S. and China are involved in something of a cold war as the federal government has restricted exports to China and put pressure on allies to do the same. In turn, the U.S. is also seeking to restrict the use of China-owned technology, such as TikTok and DeepSeek in the country. Given the relationship and the general perception of China, the reach of Huawei's AI chip could be limited to just China. Meanwhile, Nvidia seems to be losing its China business following the Trump administration's new restriction, so the threat from Huawei may be less than what it seems. However, there are concerns that a substantial percentage of Nvidia's business comes from its chips being illegally smuggled into China. It's also worth remembering that Nvidia continues to improve its own technology. At aprice-to-earnings ratioof 37, the stock looks very reasonably valued. Taking advantage of the dip here should pay off over the long run.",

        "content": "Already have a mortgage and looking for refi rates? We cover refinancing every business day, including thenational average refi ratefor all major loan types, as well asstate-by-state refi averages. The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Mortgage rates have not been spared from the market chaos triggered by President Trump's on-again, off-againtariffannouncements. Though an initial stock market sell-off prompted a drop in 10-year Treasury yields, which in turn pushed mortgage rates lower, that trend reversed after just two days. Bond yields then soared,confounding many experts\u2014and unsurprisingly shooting mortgage rates higher. But the roller coaster continues, as the 30-year mortgage rate average changed direction again two Fridays ago\u2014and continued its decline this past week. You can see the two-week change for each new purchase loan average below, followed by a deeper dive into 30-year, 15-year, and jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loans. Rates on 30-year new purchase loans have given up 22 basis points over the last two calendar weeks. That lowers the flagship average to 6.92%\u2014a notable improvement vs. the 7.14% average registered on April 11. Leading up to that reading, 30-year rates surged a remarkable 44 basis points, for their biggest Friday-to-Friday gain since June 2022 and their most expensive average in almost 11 months. Things were much better in September, when the 30-year average plunged to a two-year low of 5.89% (the cheapest Friday average being 6.03%). So far this year, the lowest weekly reading has been 6.55%. Every business day, we publishnational rate averages for various loan types, and alsoeach state's 30-year rate average. Right now, New York, California, Colorado, and Massachuetts have the lowest 30-year rates. Rates on 15-year new purchase loanshave declined even more dramatically in the past two weeks, subtracting a bold 31 basis points to average 6.00%.Still, the current reading is about a percentage point above the two-year low of 4.97% registered in September. Rates on jumbo 30-year new purchase loans fell 24 basis points across two weeks, landing Friday at a 6.91% average. That's compared to a 2025 high of 7.15%. In contrast, September rates on new 30-year jumbo loans sank as far as 6.24%, with the lowest weekly average registering at 6.39%. Ajumbo mortgageis one that exceeds the maximum loan limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming loans\u2014$806,500 for single-family homes in most parts of the U.S. in 2025, but up to $1,209,750 in certain more expensive areas. To see how much this week's rate increases would impact monthly payments for new borrowers, our tables below lay out theprincipal-plus-interest paymentfor various loan amounts with a 30-year, 15-year, or jumbo 30-year fixed-rate new purchase mortgage. By definition, jumbo 30-year mortgages are larger loans. So below we've run our calculations on loan amounts of $800,000 to $1.2 million. The national and state averages cited above are provided as is via the Zillow Mortgage API, assuming aloan-to-value (LTV) ratioof 80% (i.e., a down payment of at least 20%) and an applicant credit score in the 680\u2013739 range.

        "content": "We recently published a list of10 Stocks Analysts are Talking About Amid Trump\u2019s Tariff War. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks analysts are talking about amid Trump\u2019s tariff war. Markets saw some glimmer of hope as President Donald Trump indicated that he does not plan to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and showed openness to engage in talks with China. However, China has said in a statement that the US should dial back all unilateral duties if it\u2019s serious in negotiations. Andrew Slimmon, Morgan Stanley Investment Management senior portfolio manager, explained in a recent program on CNBC what made Trump blink: \u201cI think\u2026April 9th was an important day because on that day Trump came out and said I didn\u2019t like what I saw in the bond market, I didn\u2019t like Jamie Diamon saying there\u2019s a recession coming and he said \u201cSo I\u2019m putting a 90-day pause on.\u201d So in my opinion, what he really said is tariffs are important to me but a recession\u2019s worse and so there\u2019s the priority which he basically gave you the indication there is a Trump put out there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s down 10 15 but it was when the market was almost down 20 right, credit spread started to quake.\u201d READ ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article, we picked 10 stocks Wall Street is talking about these days. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, said in a latest program on CNBC that NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) $5.5 billion inventory write-down following US export restrictions on the company shows that the company is facing demand issues. \u201cThe first thing that crossed my mind was okay so you\u2019re trying to sell a Ferrari whose top speed is 90 mph not 200. Well, you have to write that down to zero. You can\u2019t find any other takers for this when supposedly the bull case is demand is far outstripping supply and you can sell\u2014you know, supply is the limiting issue. So that\u2019s the first thing that struck me is why are they taking a $5.5 billion write-down? But again, we\u2019ve had a lot of data points on the other side such as Microsoft, you know, walking away from data center leases, power contracts, etc. And the innovations by DeepSeek which cuts cost to produce tokens by over 90% that are now being used in US models like Meta and you go \u201cOkay, you know, I\u2019ve been saying for a while there\u2019s an AI digestion phase coming this year and there\u2019s probably some signs that it\u2014that it\u2019s actually here, that they can\u2019t resell these chips anywhere else in the world, despite supposedly demand being so amazing.\u201d The market will keep punishing Nvidia for not coming up to its gigantic (and sometimes unrealistic) growth expectations. About 50% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from large cloud providers, which are rethinking their plans amid the DeepSeek launch and looking for low-cost chips. Nvidia\u2019s Q1 guidance shows a 9.4% QoQ revenue growth, down from the previous 12% QoQ growth. Its adjusted margin is expected to be down substantially as well to 71%. The market does not like it when Nvidia fails to post a strong quarterly beat. The stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters when the company will report unimpressive growth. Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC\u2019s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia\u2019s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses TSMC\u2019s 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offer alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: \u201cNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance due to several factors. In January 2025, investor concerns grew regarding the emergence of advanced AI models from China, reportedly developed at lower costs and with reduced computing requirements, raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s market dominance. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of new tariffs targeting industries increased worries about higher operational costs. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia reported robust fiscal fourth-quarter results, highlighted by significant revenue growth driven by its data center segment. On the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the increasing computational requirements of future AI models, noting, \u201cThe more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer,\u201d and adding that future reasoning models could demand substantially more compute resources. We believe Nvidia\u2019s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure\u2014including advancements in inference and reasoning during inference\u2014continues to drive adoption among enterprises and startups, ensuring sustained demand for its high performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed and new clusters deployed, we see Nvidia as well-positioned to capitalize on rising computational needs across AI applications.\u201d Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of stocks analysts are talking about amid Trump\u2019s tariff war. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on the first day of anew trading weekthat will feature earnings reports from a slew of major corporations. Investors will also get a look atkey labor marketandinflation data, which could sway the Federal Reserve'supcoming policy decisions.President Trump has repeatedly called for additional interest-rate cuts as he approaches his 100th day in office. After trading in negative territory for much of the day, the S&P 500 gained ground in the afternoon to secure its fifth straight winning session, eking out a minor gain of less than 0.1%. The Dow added 0.3%, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1%, pressured by tech sector underperformance. Shares of biopharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV) topped the S&P 500 on Monday, jumping 3.4%. In its first-quarter earnings report released on Friday, AbbVie reportedbetter-than-expected sales and profits. The results were buoyed by strong sales growth for skin treatment Skyrizi and rheumatoid arthritis therapy Rinvoq. The company also boosted its full-year profit guidance but noted that it could see an impact from potential tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. After declining late last week in the wake oflackluster quarterly sales results, shares of fellow pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences (GILD) staged a comeback on Monday, bouncing 3.1% higher. Although softness in Gilead's COVID-19 and cancer treatments weighed on its performance, higher prices and demand helped drive sales growth for its HIV treatments, while its liver disease portfolio also posted a year-over-year sales gain. Weyerhaeuser (WY) shares added 3.1% following the timber and forest product specialist's quarterly earnings release. Sales for the period came in ahead of forecasts, and profits matched expectations. However, both figures declined year over year, weighed down by a decline in export volumes to China. Shares of Erie Indemnity (ERIE) fell 4.0%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock. Although the insurance company's first-quarter revenues topped expectations, earnings per share (EPS) came in below forecasts. Increased costs related to customer service, personnel, and spending on information technology affected Erie's profitability during the period. Colgate-Palmolive (CL) shares sank 3.1% on Monday. The maker of toothpaste, soap, and other personal care products posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit results. However, the companyreduced its full-year guidance, citing potential tariff impacts and the uncertain global economic outlook. Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) slipped 2.1% following reports that Chinese rival Huawei Technologies islaying the groundworkto test its own artificial intelligence (AI) chip. According toThe Wall Street Journal, Huawei has contacted other Chinese tech companies about evaluating the new chip, which could compete against Nvidia's AI products.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) faces pressure as Chinese competitor Huaweireportedly developsa new artificial intelligence (AI) chip, the Ascend 910D, potentially surpassing Nvidia's H100. Yahoo Finance Technology EditorDan Howleyjoins Asking for a Trend to discuss the growing AI competition between the US and China. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Meanwhile, Nvidia under pressure as China's Huawei reportedly readies an AI chip after Trump's export ban for more on what this means for the AI race between the US and China. Let's get right to Yahoo Finances Dan Howley, Dan. That's right. Nvidia kind of on its heels here when it comes to China, although I'll give a little caveat there in a second. Uh, Huawei reportedly working on a new chip called the Ascend 910D. Uh, it's the follow-up to the Ascend 910 B and C. This according to the Wall Street Journal. Uh, the the chip is supposedly supposed to be more advanced than Nvidia's H100. Now, the H100, not exactly Nvidia's latest and greatest chip, a few years old at this point. That's from the Hopper generation. Uh, they're currently in Blackwell and they already announced Blackwell Ultra and then, uh, the chips after that. Uh, but the important thing here though is that it proves that Huawei, if if these, uh, you know, estimates are are correct and that it actually does surpass the H100, it would prove that Huawei is pushing forward with their own capabilities without the help of US technologies, uh, like Nvidia's. And so, uh, the caveat being here that Nvidia really doesn't sell much in China and can't sell much in China anymore now that, uh, the White House has basically said, look, the H20 that you built specifically for the Chinese market, uh, it it's going to be under export restrictions. Uh, and so more or less it's it's banned from being sold. Uh, China did make up a good chunk of revenue for Nvidia in its prior quarter. And now they're saying they're going to have to pay back 5.5 billion as far as charges go related to some of the chips that they were expected to ship out to the country. But it it this chip is important for Huawei, but it doesn't say that the Nvidia is falling behind. Uh, it's showing that there's another alternative available to Chinese market customers. Uh, and so this kind of back and forth between the US over which is going to win the the AI wars kind of continues on now. Uh, the US was trying to push China away, uh, kind of leaving them, uh, in in the dark as far as the technologies go, so that the US could maintain its its stance as the the number one AI power. But China clearly showing that it's not going to kind of sit back and let that happen. Here's a broader policy question for you, my friend, which is, so the Chinese government would obviously like to be a global tech powerhouse. The US government would prefer they not be. And so we impose these export controls which which some believe, listen, the CCP is an adversary and we've got to try to move these levers. Um, others argue what it's doing, perhaps, is encouraging Chinese companies like the Huaweis to get more creative, to get more dynamic and innovative. I'm I'm just curious your your thoughts on that. Yeah, that seems to be the the the takeaway that uh, has kind of become the the go-to since uh, we've seen deep seek R1 and V3 models that were developed using Nvidia's technology, earlier technology, the H20s. Uh, you know, those chips are not top of the line, top of the line, but they managed to produce models that uh, were up there with what Open AI has to offer built using the the latest and greatest. So it really is a matter of, okay, they're going to find a way of uh, researchers in China that they're, you know, obviously, they're motivated to make, you know, the latest and greatest models as well, uh, prove that they can be as much of a powerhouse in AI as the US. And that appears to be exactly, uh, what they're doing, uh, and, you know, regardless of uh, what the US tries to do with stopping different types of technologies from flowing there, uh, it seems to be that China will do what it has to do to be an AI powerhouse. Dan, great to see you. Thank you, my friend.",

Treasuries rose. The dollar fell. From jobs to inflation and economic growth, traders will have a lot to digest this week. A measure of Texas manufacturing activity weakened significantly as executives used words like \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201cinsanity\u201d to describe the tariff turmoil, according to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \u201cThis will be one of the busiest weeks of the year,\u201d said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise. \u201cOngoing trade headlines, an economic calendar filled with key releases and the peak week of the earnings season, including several Magnificent Seven companies reporting results, should keep investors\u2019 heads spinning.\u201d With a jittery April near a close, several market pros see little reason to think volatility is in the rearview mirror. For equities to keep rallying, investors would need to see the White House follow through on the \u201cdovish pivot\u201d toward trade with China, according to Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC the US has put China to the side for now as it seeks trade deals with between 15 to 17 other countries, while indicating it\u2019s up to Beijing to take the first step in de-escalating the tariff fight. \u201cUnderneath the surface, key risks persist \u2014 trade tensions, recession worries, and monetary policy uncertainties are very much alive,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. Read: Bessent Sets July 4 Tax Bill Goal as Economic Worries Mount While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Michael Wilson says the weak dollar will support US corporate earnings, helping the American stock market to outperform the rest of the world. Yet Wilson expects the S&P 500 to remain in the 5,000 to 5,500 range. A more substantial increase would require a tariff deal with China, clear rebound in earnings estimates and the possibility of easier monetary policy, he wrote. Meantime, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s trading desk is turning tactically bullish on US equities, predicting that tailwinds including big-tech earnings and trade deal announcements will continue to lift stocks after the recent rout. Still, the bank was quick to emphasize in a note to clients Monday that the rally\u2019s momentum could fade within weeks, with the negative impacts of US tariffs poised to begin dragging on the economy in the months ahead. Corporate Highlights: Chief executive officers from Nvidia Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly & Co., General Electric Co. and SoftBank Group Corp. are among corporate leaders slated to visit the White House on Wednesday as President Trump highlights the US investments they\u2019ve announced in the first 100 days of his second term in office. International Business Machines Corp. plans to invest $150 billion in the US over the next five years, joining a cohort of companies that have announced spending commitments following Trump\u2019s election and tariff threats.

        "content": "We recently published a list ofBillionaire Israel Englander\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s stock picks with huge upside potential. Millennium Managementis a globally recognized investment firm specializing in multi-strategy hedge fund offerings. Founded in 1989 by Israel A. Englander and Ronald Shear, the firm initially launched with $35 million in capital, including a $5 million contribution from Englander and additional investment secured from Canadian financiers, the Belzberg brothers. Despite early struggles that led to Shear\u2019s departure just six months after its inception, Millennium evolved into one of the largest and most successful alternative asset management firms. As of late 2024, it boasts over $75.8 billion in assets under management. Headquartered in New York, Millennium has expanded its operations globally, establishing 18 primary offices in major financial hubs including London, Dubai, Singapore, and Tokyo. The firm employs a platform-based investment approach, with approximately 330 independent investment teams operating under a decentralized model. These teams deploy a wide array of strategies across multiple asset classes, including equities, fixed income, commodities, and derivatives. Millennium\u2019s core strategies focus on fundamental equity research, equity arbitrage, macroeconomic-driven fixed income investments, and commodity-based trades. Through this highly diversified, data-driven model, the firm aims to generate consistent, high-quality returns while managing risk effectively across global markets. Under the leadership of Israel Englander, who remains the driving force behind the firm, Millennium has cultivated a disciplined risk management framework and continuously refined its investment strategies. A graduate of New York University who left his MBA program early to trade on the American Stock Exchange, Englander applied his market-making and derivatives trading expertise to build Millennium into an institutional powerhouse. His innovative approach emphasizes capital allocation to specialized teams rather than direct investment decisions, fostering a dynamic and competitive investment environment that attracts top talent from around the world. By 2011, Millennium was managing approximately $13 billion in assets, and in recent years, Englander has explored opportunities to sell a minority stake in the firm, signaling a move toward broader institutional ownership. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, Millennium reported managing $204.64 billion in 13F securities, with its top ten holdings accounting for 15.5% of its portfolio. It has consistently ranked among the highest-grossing hedge funds, achieving the fourth-largest net gains of any hedge fund since inception. Millennium\u2019s commitment to generating superior risk-adjusted returns, maintaining a diversified investment approach, and embracing strategic innovation has earned it a formidable reputation among institutional investors. With its expansive global presence, proven track record, and disciplined investment philosophy, Millennium Management continues to be a dominant force in the global hedge fund industry. For this article, we searched through Millennium Management\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s stock picks with the highest upside potential. We compiled the equities with upside potential higher than 33% based on analyst ratings and discussed why they stood out as sound potential investments. Finally, we ranked the stocks based on the ascending order of their upside potential. To assist readers with more context, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 363.5% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (see more details here). Israel Englander of Millennium Management Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 223 Millennium Management\u2019s Equity Stake: $1.34 Billion Upside Potential as of April 26: 51.78% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a global leader in GPU-accelerated computing, is widely recognized for its groundbreaking work in graphics processing units (GPUs) that power gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and the automotive industry. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $39.3 billion, reflecting a 12% increase from the previous quarter and a staggering 78% year-over-year growth. This achievement was largely fueled by the company\u2019s Data Center segment, which alone posted a record $35.6 billion in quarterly revenue, up 16% from Q3 and an impressive 93% increase compared to the previous year. GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.89, representing a 14% sequential rise and an 82% increase year-over-year. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has encountered a major challenge in its AI business following new export restrictions imposed by the Trump administration, which now bar the company from selling its H20 AI accelerators in China\u2014a market previously expected to generate around $16 billion in revenue. In response, CEO Jensen Huang visited China to meet with officials, including Ren Hongbin of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, to reaffirm NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to the Chinese market despite the regulatory hurdles. Accompanied by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, a key customer, Huang emphasized that the company will continue its operations in China. However, NVIDIA now faces the urgent task of developing a compliant alternative product while dealing with rising competition from Chinese tech giants like Huawei, who are advancing their own AI systems that could rival NVIDIA\u2019s latest offerings. Despite external challenges such as energy demands, investor confidence in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains robust. The stock carries a current price target of $168.49, with analysts projecting a substantial upside potential of 51.78%. This strong outlook positions NVIDIA as fourth among billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s stock picks with the highest upside potential, reinforcing its continued appeal to investors eager to capitalize on the transformative growth of artificial intelligence and next-generation computing technologies. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024investor letter: \u201cNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company\u2019s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.\u201d Overall, NVDAranks 4thon our list of billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "content": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -CEOs and senior executives from Nvidia, Johnson & Johnson, Hyundai Motor, Toyota Motor, and SoftBank Group are among the more than two-dozen business leaders slated to visit the White House on Wednesday for an event highlighting U.S. investments, officials told Reuters. President Donald Trump plans to promote a broad range of investments in the United States in defense, tech, healthcare and consumer products industries and investment funds marking his first 100 days in office at an \"Investing in America\" event, a White House official told Reuters. Trump is seeking to encourage U.S. and foreign companies to expand manufacturing in the United States, while he has sparked a global trade war, imposing tariffs on a wide range of countries. Airlines, aerospace firms, automakers and retailers have expressed worries about the impact of tariffs on U.S. manufacturing and sales. The White House touted investment commitments from Taiwan chipmaker TSMC, Apple, and Roche saying they \"demonstrate resounding confidence in the U.S. economy and dollar under this administration.\" Some major companies have said they want more details on trade and other government regulations before committing to new investments. Trump has said General Motors is considering a new $60 billion investment in the United States. \"I need clarity, and then I need consistency,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said at a Semafor forum last week. \"To make those investments and to be good stewards of our owner\u2019s capital, I need to understand what the policy is.\" Trump has said he is considering granting automakers some relief from new auto tariffs. In January, he announced a private-sector investment of up to $500 billion to fund infrastructure for artificial intelligence, aiming to outpace rival nations in the business-critical technology. That is expected to include ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle. Last month, South Korea's Hyundai announced a $21 billion investment in the U.S. at the White House, including a new $5.8 billion Hyundai Steel plant in Louisiana that will produce over 2.7 million metric tons of steel annually, creating more than 1,400 jobs.
