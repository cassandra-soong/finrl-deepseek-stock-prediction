        "header": "Did Nvidia Make a Colossal Mistake by Selling SoundHound AI Stock?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.52%)added an eye-popping $2.8 trillion to its market capitalization since the start of 2023, thanks to soaring demand for its data center chips that are the best in the world for developing artificial intelligence (AI). The company also invested in a portfolio of other AI stocks, andSoundHound AI(SOUN-6.55%)was one of them. SoundHound is a specialist in conversational AI, and it has an impressive list of customers that includes some of the biggest brands in the world from industries like hospitality and car manufacturing. But when Nvidia filed its 13-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the final quarter of 2024, SoundHound stock was notably missing -- it turns out the chip giant sold its entire stake toward the end of last year. SoundHound recently reported its latest financial results for the first quarter of 2025 (ended March 31), and its stock soared by almost 30% since. Did Nvidia sell its position too early? Image source: Getty Images. SoundHound's conversationalAItechnology understands voice prompts and can respond in kind, and it has been deployed by some of the biggest businesses in the world to transform the way we interact with our devices, our cars, and even our favorite restaurants. SoundHound is active in almost 13,000 quick-service restaurants, operated by chains like White Castle,Chipotle, andPapa John's. Its Voice AI technology can autonomously take orders from customers over the phone, in-store, and in the drive-thru, reducing the workload on employees so they can spend more time on other tasks. SoundHound also offers a product called Employee Assist, which stands ready to provide workers with information on menu items and in-store procedures. In the automotive industry, SoundHound's Chat AI in-car voice assistant is used by top brands likeHyundai, Kia, andStellantis(the owner of Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge). It can answer questions on a broad range of topics, and it can also provide-real time information on sports scores and stock prices. SoundHound also launched a new platform called Voice Commerce earlier this year, which allows drivers to place food orders from the comfort of their vehicle. It can even recommend restaurants and provide directions using the car's GPS system. SoundHoundexpanded its product portfolio even further when it acquired another AI company called Amelia in August last year. Amelia's platform allows businesses to create custom AI agents that can be deployed to serve customers or even help employees with specific tasks. It's used in industries like healthcare, financial services, insurance, and more, which is helping SoundHound diversify its revenue base. SoundHound generated $29.1 million in totalrevenueduring the first quarter of 2025, which was a whopping 151% increase from the year-ago period. The inclusion of Amelia's revenue boosted the result, but the company also continued to experience broad demand for its core products. Management is no longer updating investors on SoundHound's order backlog, but CFO Nitesh Sharan said it continued to grow from the previous quarter three months earlier, when it was an eye-popping $1.2 billion. The company expects to convert that backlog into revenue over a period of six years, so it could be a great predictor of future top-line results. The strong first-quarter results prompted SoundHound to reaffirm its full-year guidance for 2025, suggesting revenue could soar 97% year over year to $167 million (at the midpoint of the forecasted range). Nvidia never disclosed why it sold SoundHound stock, but its current valuation is one reason investors might want to steer clear for now. It trades at aprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof 40.8 as of this writing, which makes it significantly more expensive than Nvidia itself. That doesn't make much sense considering the AI chip giant isone of the highest-quality companies in the world, with a track record of success spanning decades:  SOUN PS Ratiodata byYCharts SoundHound stock looks a little less expensive if we value it using its future potential revenue. If we assume the company generates $167 million this year as management expects, that places its stock at a forward P/S ratio at 27.1. But considering that figure is still higher than Nvidia's P/S ratio today, I definitely wouldn't say the stock looks attractive. Plus, SoundHound's bottom line poses a key risk. The company generated a rare profit of $129 million on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis during the first quarter, but only because of a $176 million benefit relating to one of its acquisitions. On anon-GAAPbasis, which excludes one-off and non-cash components, SoundHound still lost $22.3 million, which was a 10% increase from the year-ago period. SoundHound had $246 million in cash and equivalents on hand at the end of the quarter, so it can afford to keep losing money at the current pace for the next couple of years. However, if the company does require more cash in the future, it might have to issue more stock, which would result in significant dilution for existing shareholders. Nvidiaonly held 1.73 million shares in SoundHound, which would have been worth just $19.5 million based on its current stock price. Considering Nvidia is nearly a $3.3 trillion company, even a complete loss probably wouldn't have affected its finances at all. Even though we don't know why Nvidia sold its entire stake, SoundHound's valuation is enough reason for investors to tread very carefully if they are looking to buy.",

        "header": "Better U.S.-China Tariff Deal Buy: Amazon vs Nvidia",
        "content": "Over the past couple of months, one particular element has guided stock market movement, and that's President Trump's import tariff plan. Trump set out a broad framework early last month, including double-digit tariffs on countries worldwide and a tariff on China that reached 145%, and that sent stocks spiraling lower. The concern was high tariff levels would weigh on the economy and even lead to a recession. That wouldn't be good news for corporate earnings or share prices. But, when Trump halted the plan for 90 days to allow for negotiations with countries, indexes rebounded. And just this week as the U.S. and Chinareached an initial dealthat greatly lowered tariff levels, the three major indexes soared. TheS&P 500even moved into positive territory for the year after earlier falling as much as 15%. Among the biggest gainers in the market were tech stocks. Though Trump has exempted electronics for now, he indicated duties specifically for these products were on the way -- and tech companies rely heavily on manufacturing abroad. So, a satisfactory trade deal between the U.S. and China suggests any tariffs on electronics also would be manageable. Against this backdrop, let's consider which of the following market leaders --Amazon(AMZN0.26%)orNivida(NVDA-0.52%)-- make the better buy today. Image source: Getty Images. You may know Amazon well as a seller of everything from groceries and essentials to mass merchandise. And since many of those items are imported from China or other countries, the company clearly is exposed to the tariff risk. On top of this, Amazon Web Services (AWS), thecloud computingunit, sells products -- such as artificial intelligence (AI) chips -- that are produced abroad to U.S. customers. That, too, represents exposure to tariffs. This means agreements with lower-than-expected tariffs represent good news for Amazon. Of course, any tariff at all will add to costs or could push prices higher, but a well-established powerhouse like Amazon has what it takes to handle the challenge. The company said in its recent earnings call that it's already taken steps to manage the situation -- for example, buying some inventory early to lock in lower prices. Meanwhile, it's important to keep in mind that third-party sellers on Amazon may have different strategies -- some may pass costs on to customers while others may not. So, with the enormous selection of products on Amazon, even in a tariff environment, shoppers still should be able to find bargains. Now, though, with the tariff situation looking brighter, there's even more reason to be optimistic about ongoing growth from Amazon, a company that's delivered an impressive earnings track record over the years. And as Amazon continues to win in AI -- its AI offerings helped AWS deliver a $117 billion annual revenue run rate in the recent quarter -- growth could take off. Nvidia has become the name that's practically synonymous with AI. The company is the world's top seller of AI chips and has developed an entire ecosystem of related products and services -- making it the \"go to\" destination for any potential customer looking to develop an AI platform. All of this has helped Nvidia generate double- and triple-digit quarterly revenue growth, with that revenue reaching record levels. This momentum led Nvidia shares higher in recent years -- but tariff news weighed heavily on them over the past couple of months. Investors worried about an eventual tariff on electronics imports hurting Nvidia's revenue growth since the company relies on manufacturing in Taiwan. Immediately, Nvidia took action, setting out a plan to invest in U.S. manufacturing and eventually make AI supercomputers in the U.S. for the first time. Mass production is expected to ramp up at two facilities over the coming 12 to 15 months. So, like Amazon, Nvidia has been taking action to control the level of risk presented by tariffs. But, of course, the idea that tariffs in general may be much lower than originally expected is fantastic news for the company. It means Nvidia may not have to rush to shift production to the U.S. and instead can pace its investment -- without being crushed by massive tariff levels in the meantime. So, like Amazon, Nvidia is positioned to benefit from this new tariff climate, making it a solid stock to own right now. Which of these tech giants makes the better buy following the U.S. and China tariff talks? Let'sconsider valuationbefore answering the question. Right now, both of these stocks are trading at very reasonable levels, much lower in relation to forward earnings estimates from earlier in the year.  AMZN PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts But Nvidia looks particularly interesting from this valuation perspective, and I would even consider it cheap at today's level. As mentioned, high tariff levels represented a risk for both Amazon and Nvidia -- and today, the worst-case scenario has disappeared, replaced by a situation that should be much more manageable. That makes both of these stocks a great buy at the moment, but considering valuation, Nvidia gets extra points in my book -- so if you can only choose one of these top AI stocks, Nvidia makes thebetter buy right now.",

        "content": "ServiceNow(NOW0.24%),AMD(AMD-2.35%), andCrowdStrike(CRWD-0.95%)were all breakout growth stocks and delivered some life-changing gains for their patient investors. ServiceNow, which went public in 2012, has soared nearly 5,680% from its initial public offering (IPO) price. AMD went public back in 1979, but its stock has surged about 4,900% in the past 20 years alone. CrowdStrike's stock has rallied roughly 1,190% since its IPO in 2019. Investors might be reluctant to buy those growth stocks today as the Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs and other macro headwinds rattle the markets. However, I believe these three stocks could still have plenty of room to run over the next decade. Image source: Getty Images. ServiceNow'scloud-basedplatform helps large companies organize their businesses by streamlining their work patterns into structured digital workflows. By breaking down the silos and getting everyone on the same page, ServiceNow makes it easier to delegate tasks, support hybrid and remote workers, execute faster decisions, and trim expenses. Its Now AssistAI platformaccelerates that process with even more automation tools and chatbots. ServiceNow's business thrives in both bull and bear markets. Companies will use its platform to expand efficiently when the economy is healthy, and they'll use it to trim fat during economic downturns. From 2019 to 2024, its number of year-end customers with an annual contract value of more than $1 million more than doubled from 892 to 2,109. It achieved that growth even as its clients navigated the pandemic, inflation, rising rates, and other macro headwinds. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect ServiceNow's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 27%. The company might not seem like a bargain at 120 times this year's earnings, but it should keep growing at double-digits over the next decade as it continues to modernize workflows with its cloud and AI services. AMD is the world's second largest producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers afterIntel. It's also the second largest producer of discrete GPUs asNvidia. AMD is the underdog in both markets, but it's still grown like a weed ever since Lisa Su took the helm as its CEO in 2014. Under Su, AMD diligently redesigned its CPUs and GPUs, outsourced most of its production toTSMC, and sold more custom APUs (accelerated processing units) for gaming consoles. AMD also acquired Xilinx to expand its programmable chip business, ZT Systems for its data center infrastructure, and other smaller companies to diversify its business beyond the cyclical PC market. AMD's manufacturing partnership with TSMC enabled AMD to pullahead of Intel, which struggled to manufacture smaller chips at its own foundries, over the past several years. Moreover, AMD rolled out cheaper data center GPUs to challenge Nvidia in the AI market. Those long-term catalysts should fuel its growth for at least the next 10 years. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect AMD's revenue and EPS to increase at a CAGR of 18% and 66%, respectively. It isn't cheap at 59 times this year's earnings, but it could remain one of the easiest ways to profit from the secular growth of the semiconductor sector. CrowdStrike's main platform, Falcon, provides endpoint security services to a wide range of industries. But unlike many older cybersecurity companies, which install their services through on-site appliances, CrowdStrike only provides its tools as cloud-based services -- which are stickier, easier to scale as a company expands, and can be updated remotely. From fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2025 (which ended in January), CrowdStrike's percentage of year-end customers which had adopted at least five of its cloud-based modules rose from 33% to 67%. As it locks its customers in more tightly with those modules, CrowdStrike is rolling out new agentic AI-driven services to keep pace with AI-powered challengers likeSentinelOne. From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 23%. They also expect the company to turn profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in fiscal 2027 and more than triple its net income the following year. CrowdStrike's stock might seem pricey at 23 times this year's sales, but it should flourish over the next decade for three simple reasons: its cloud-native approach to cybersecurity is disruptive, the cybersecurity market is still growing, and it's resistant to recessions because companies won't shut off their digital defenses to save a few dollars. Therefore, investing in CrowdStrike could be a smart move for patient long-term investors.",

        "header": "Trump\u2019s Rush to Cut AI Deals in Saudi Arabia and UAE Opens Rift With China Hawks",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of artificial intelligence deals during his tour of the Middle East is opening a rift within his own administration as China hawks grow increasingly concerned the projects are putting US national security and economic interests at risk. Most Read from Bloomberg As Coastline Erodes, One California City Considers \u2018Retreat Now\u2019 How a Highway Became San Francisco\u2019s Newest Park Maryland\u2019s Credit Rating Gets Downgraded as Governor Blames Trump Power-Hungry Data Centers Are Warming Homes in the Nordics NYC Commuters Brace for Chaos as NJ Transit Strike Looms The Trump team has worked out agreements for parties in Saudi Arabia to acquire tens of thousands of semiconductors from Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., while shipments to the United Arab Emirates could top a million accelerators \u2014 mostly for projects involving or owned by US companies. Such chips are used to develop and train models that can mimic human intelligence, and they\u2019re the most coveted technology of the AI age. Some senior administration officials are seeking to slow down the deals over concerns the US hasn\u2019t imposed sufficient guardrails to prevent American chips shipped to the Gulf from ultimately benefiting China, which has deep ties in the region, according to people familiar with the matter. While the UAE and Saudi accords include high-level language barring Chinese firms from accessing those chips, these officials argue too many details are still unresolved and the deals shouldn\u2019t be announced without legally binding provisions, the people said. China hawks also have grown alarmed over what they see as a willingness by White House AI Adviser David Sacks, who\u2019s helping lead the talks, to entertain proposals from Gulf leaders that they view as clear national security risks. None of those proposals are included in the current bilateral accords in the Middle East. Beyond those security issues, some senior Trump officials question the wisdom of shipping such large quantities of chips to any location outside the US, given the administration\u2019s focus on maintaining American dominance in AI, said the people. As Vice President JD Vance put it at a Paris AI summit in February, \u201cthe Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American designed and manufactured chips.\u201d If the announced and planned Middle East deals all come to fruition, the US would still hold the vast majority of the world\u2019s computing power \u2014 but Gulf countries would for the first time have significant capabilities powered by best-in-class US hardware. A representative for the White House didn\u2019t provide official comment for this story, which is based on interviews with nearly a dozen people who spoke about internal administration discussions on condition of anonymity. Nvidia and a spokesperson for the UAE declined to comment, while AMD and the Saudi Arabian government didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely perplexed how any self-proclaimed \u2018China Hawk\u2019 can claim that President Trump\u2019s AI deals with UAE and Saudi Arabia aren\u2019t hugely beneficial for the United States,\u201d Sacks, who didn\u2019t respond to Bloomberg\u2019s request for comment for this story, later wrote on X. \u201cThe only question you need to ask is: does China wish it had made these deals? Yes of course it does. But President Trump got there first and beat them to the punch.\u201d Advocates for the deals, including Sacks, argue that if the US doesn\u2019t encourage the world to use American chips, countries with AI ambitions will eventually turn to alternatives from Chinese companies \u2014 which have made progress in closing the gap with Nvidia, the industry leader. \u201cWe need our friends, like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other strategic partners and allies, to want to build on our tech,\u201d Sacks said Tuesday while on stage with Saudi Arabia\u2019s minister of communications and information technology. The possibility of that tech winding up in China is \u201cnot an issue with a friend like Saudi Arabia at all,\u201d he said. Not everyone in the Trump administration agrees. In escalating conversations over the past two days, several senior officials have discussed strategies for slowing the implementation of Gulf AI agreements \u2014 and pumping the brakes on projects that have yet to be unveiled, the people said. One concern is a bilateral accord between the US and UAE that could include a massive project by OpenAI, the industry pioneer behind ChatGPT. Trump arrived in Abu Dhabi on Thursday after stops earlier this week in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Officials on the ground were still in active negotiations the morning of the president\u2019s visit, according to people familiar with the matter, who added that they expect the deals to move forward in the near term. The US and UAE governments on Thursday said that G42, the Abu Dhabi-based AI firm, will work with several unidentified US firms to build a colossal data center with a capacity of 5 gigawatts. If that happens, China hawks may press their concerns through the regulatory process in Washington. All AI chip shipments to the Gulf require US government approval through a licensing process involving several federal agencies. Administration officials are also in the middle of drafting global semiconductor export control rules after tossing out a framework introduced by President Joe Biden. That provides another opportunity to include specific China guardrails and other strategic priorities. Sacks, along with other officials who support the Gulf projects, has made the case that aggressive proliferation with security provisions would be a strategic win for the US \u2014 and crucial for maintaining American leadership in AI. Part of Sacks\u2019 argument \u2014 echoed by tech leaders including Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang \u2014 is that the US lead over China in advanced chipmaking is shrinking. If Washington prevents countries with AI ambitions from building data centers with American technology, the logic goes, the US risks ceding those markets to its main geopolitical rival. Companies may choose to buy chips from the likes of Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese tech giant at the center of Washington\u2019s efforts to curtail Beijing\u2019s AI ambitions. On the other side of the debate, some officials in both the Trump and Biden administrations have argued that America\u2019s technological lead is quite large and enables Washington to write the rules of the road for as long as other countries still covet American chips. Policymakers can afford to be aggressive in negotiations, these officials argue, and shouldn\u2019t allow countries to access best-in-class American hardware without concessions and ironclad security promises. Trump officials in this second camp think they may be losing the internal fight over Middle East chip shipments \u2014 especially after the UAE and Saudi Arabia offered a combined $2.4 trillion in US investments that helped pave the way for the recent AI deals. In particular, some senior administration officials have grown wary of negotiating positions adopted by Sacks, who has been one of the central players on the ground as government officials and tech executives hammer out the accords. In one meeting with Emirati officials ahead of Trump\u2019s trip, Sacks expressed openness to the UAE housing a production facility from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the leading maker of chips for the likes of Nvidia and AMD, people familiar with the matter said. The UAE has long coveted such a plant and asked the US government for its support as part of the broader chip accord. The hawkish Trump officials view a possible TSMC plant in the UAE as dangerous, the people said. Supporting the UAE\u2019s ambitions to manufacture AI chips domestically would create unnecessary national security risks given the country\u2019s ties to Beijing, the officials argue, especially if political alliances change in the future. The current accord doesn\u2019t include a TSMC plant, though separate conversations about such a project remain ongoing. TSMC declined to comment. Another lingering concern with the UAE is G42, which has historic ties to Huawei. Although it agreed to divest from Huawei and other Chinese providers to pave the way for a $1.5 billion partnership with Microsoft Corp. last year, some US officials remain wary of G42\u2019s commitment to American priorities. Now the Trump administration is considering an agreement that would allow G42 to buy the equivalent of more than a million Nvidia H100 accelerators, among the chipmaker\u2019s top offerings, Bloomberg has reported. Critics of that accord include the chairman of the House China Select Committee, which last year released a video detailing the bipartisan panel\u2019s G42 concerns. The voiceover in that video comes from Landon Heid, Trump\u2019s nominee for a top position at the agency that writes chip export rules and decides whether to approve individual semiconductor sales. Details of the security requirements in the broader UAE accord will be sorted out in a working group composed of American and Emirati officials, according to the people familiar with the matter. Topics already in the agreement include provisions to prevent diversion of chips to China and bar Chinese AI companies from remotely accessing UAE facilities. Sacks has been angling to steer efforts to write the fine print, the people said \u2014 something that several of his US counterparts oppose. At one point in negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Saudi officials suggested they may install US chips in facilities that contain Huawei hardware, the people said, adding that the hardware in question was not Huawei\u2019s AI chips. The US delegation shot down that suggestion in the meeting, but after the fact, Sacks suggested that Trump\u2019s team should at least evaluate the idea. While some officials understood Sacks\u2019 reaction as a suggestion to consider national security concerns on a technical basis, others saw it as an immediate disregard for why US officials would hold those concerns in the first place. For officials who view Huawei as a red line in Washington\u2019s China policy, the exploration of that possibility was unacceptable. The idea is not part of the current accord, people familiar with the matter said. \u201cThe policy objective of preventing diversion to countries of concern is an absolutely important objective of the United States but it is not a difficult one to achieve,\u201d Sacks said during his Middle East appearance. \u201cThe truth of the matter is that all one would have to do is send someone to a data center and count the server racks to make sure the chips are still there.\u201d --With assistance from Riley Griffin and Nick Wadhams.

        "content": "This has been a difficult year forNvidia(NVDA-0.52%).\u00a0 Shares of the chipmaker are down around 8% so far in 2025 as of this writing. But a closer look at the recent stock price action suggests investors are regaining confidence in the artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer. The stock has jumped 27% in the past three weeks, thanks to positive reports from tech giants that use Nvidia's AI chips, along with encouraging commentary frompeers in the semiconductor industry. Now, the latest development in the U.S.-Chinatariffstandoff suggests that Nvidia's upcoming results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended April 27), which will be announced on May 28, could further boost investor confidence in the stock and send it higher. Image source: Getty Images. The Trump administration's decision to implement duties of 145% on imports from China last monthweighed on semiconductor stocks, including Nvidia, even though the White House exempted imports of chips, processors, and certain other electronic components from reciprocal tariffs. However, there were reports that a separate set of tariffs could be announced on semiconductors. But now, the U.S. and China have agreed on bringing down the reciprocal tariffs by 115% for a period of 90 days. As a result, the duties on Chinese goods imported into the U.S. will come down to 30%, while tariffs on U.S. goods imported into China will stand at 10%. This development comes in the wake of China's rollback of tariffs on imports of microchips from the U.S. Earlier, President Donald Trump had indicated that he was willing to reduce duties on Chinese imports. All this suggests that the storm of the tariff turmoil that has weighed on Nvidia stock so far this year could be fading. Nvidia customerMeta Platformsrecently indicated that it wasready to bear the increasein costs of AI hardware thanks to the tariff imposition. There were reports last month that memory manufacturerMicron Technology, whichsupplies high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chipsfor Nvidia's AI graphics cards, was imposing a tariff-fueled surcharge on some of its products to account for the increased costs. So, the tariff burden could have hurt Nvidia's sales and margins considering that it outsources chip production across various locations globally. This explains why a recent report by DigiTimes (via Tom's Hardware) states that Nvidia raised the price of its AI graphics processing units (GPUs) by up to 15% to cope with the tariff-related effects. The global economic uncertainty fueled by the tariffs could have negatively affected AI spending. Reports of a pullback byMicrosoftin leasing more data center capacity in February added to this fear. However, the positive tariff-related development between the U.S. and China should mitigate the concerns about a potential AI spending slowdown, and this could result in solid guidance from Nvidia later this month. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to deliver $43 billion in revenue for fiscal Q1, an improvement of 65% from the year-ago period. That's in line with the company's guidance range. However, a surge in orders from Chinese clients could help Nvidia's top line exceed those expectations. According to a Reuters report, the likes of ByteDance,Alibaba, and Tencent placed orders for at least $16 billion worth of Nvidia's H20 AI GPUs in the first three months of 2025. That's quite significant, considering that Nvidia's revenue from China in the previous fiscal year reportedly stood at just over $17 billion. So, China could move the needle in a much bigger way for Nvidia in Q1 of fiscal 2026 and play a key role in helping the company surge past analysts' expectations. The jump in Nvidia's China revenue has been attributed to an increase in demand for low-cost AI models. Meanwhile, the company has been altering its AI chips to bring them in line with the export controls imposed on the shipments of its chips to China, something that it has done in the past to ensure access to the Chinese market. Throw in the AI infrastructure projects going on in the U.S., such as Stargate, and Nvidia'sterrific control over the AI chip supply chain, the stage seems set for the chipmaker to coast past Wall Street's expectations and ensure that its newly found stock market momentum continues beyond May 28. That's why savvy investors can consider buying thisAI stockright now. It's trading at an attractive 28 times forward earnings, a big discount to the U.S. technology sector'sprice-to-earnings ratioof 44.",

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. If you have some money invested and other money in general savings, you have choices on where to stash that uninvested cash. One option is to keep it all at the brokerage where you have your investments. However, the interest rates brokerages pay on cash balances are sometimes quite a bit less than what you can earn witha competitive high-yield savings account. But if you shop around, there are currently some excellent deals on what you can earn at a brokerage. Granted, like many promotions, these have a limited runway\u2014the elevated return you can earn won't last forever. But if you find it useful or simply convenient to hold uninvested cash at the same place as investments, these current brokerage bonuses are worth a look. Moomoooften tops the list of the best cash balance interest rates, with its base rate of 4.10% APY out-paying the runners-up that offer 4.00%. But right now, new Moomoo customers are in for a treat, as a current promotion will let you earn a 4% boost, raising your APY on idle cash to a whopping 8.10%. Limitations are that the APY boost is only valid for the first 3 months. And you can only earn the promotional rate on cash balances up to $20,000. The effective earnings on this offer over the course of a year would be 5.10%, if you assume an 8.10% APY for 3 months followed by 9 months at the base rate of 4.00%, and also assume the current base rate of 4.00% will still be available in months 4\u201312. In tandem with this offer, new Moomoo customers can also earn free stocks through an additional promotion, which awards them a number of random stock picks based on the amount of money they deposit into the account. Details can be found onMoomoo's promotion page. M1is also rewarding new customers to its platform, giving them a 0.50% boost to the base rate of 4.00% APY. The resulting 4.50% return can be earned on any balance amount for a period of 3 months, similar to Moomoo's deal. But M1 will pay that 4.50% boosted rate on much higher balances, topping out at $200,000. On this offer and the next two, your effective annualized rate would be roughly 4.13%. That's based on an assumption of earning 4.50% for the first three months, then 4.00% for months 4-12. Here again,Bettermentis offering a 0.50% bump to its 4.00% base rate, and the 4.50% rate will be paid for 3 months. But unlike Moomoo and M1, this offer does not cap the cash balance you can hold at Betterment and earn the 4.50% rate. It does require, however, that you make a qualifying deposit into your new account (no minimum amount stipulated) within the first 14 days of opening the account. Wealthfrontalso offers an ultimate rate of 4.50% APY\u20144.00% with a 3-month bump of 0.50%. But to earn Wealthfront's boost, you need to refer a friend and that friend needs to sign up for a Wealthfront account. There are no rules, however, on the definition of friend, so it could be a spouse or family member. It does cap the cash balance that can earn the 4.50% promotional rate, but at a generous $250,000. If you want to move money in and out of investments regularly, keeping your cash at your brokerage makes things easy. But it isn't your most lucrative option. Instead, today's best high-yield savings accounts pay more than these promo-boosted brokerage APYs. And once the 3-month offer expires, the gap widens much more between what you'd earn at a brokerage vs. what you could earn instead with a high-yield bank account. Also, because transfers from a savings account to a brokerage are usually executed within one day, it's generally not a problem to hold your savings at an outside account. Every business day, we monitor the rates of over 100 nationally available savings accounts and rank the top offers by highest APY. Right now, the top two accounts inour daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accountspay 5.00%. But beyond those, you have 15 more options to choose from that pay 4.35% or better. If you want to keep some money at your brokerage, so that you can quickly make an investment trade without having to set up an external transfer, one option is to keep a portion of your surplus cash at the brokerage for that purpose, earning their cash management rate. And you could keep another portion in a higher-paying savings account to maximize your overall cash return. We update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available: Note that the \"top rates\" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

        "content": "Applied Materials (AMAT) shares fell in extended trading Thursday after the chip equipment manufacturer postedquarterly revenue below Wall Street expectationsamid a slump in China sales. Despite the fall in Chinese revenue, which accounted for about a quarter of the company\u2019s total sales in the quarter, the firm said it had not seen significant changes to customer demand, adding that it remains well positioned to navigate evolving macro conditions. However, investors remain concerned the U.S. could impose sector specific tariffs on chips and electronics,which have been exempt from import duties since early April. AMAT shares plunged nearly 40% between late January and early April amid concerns that the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies, including newAI chip licensing export requirements to China, could affect the company\u2019s sales. However, the stock has rallied around 40% from last month\u2019s low following a recenttrade war truceand ongoing negotiations between the two countries.

        "header": "1 Semiconductor Stock That Could Be a Surprise AI Winner",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-2.35%)is gradually evolving from mostly a traditional chip company to a prominentartificial intelligence(AI) infrastructure player. While Wall Street has been mostly focusing onNvidia, AMD has quietly established itself as a strong player in the AI data center business. The company provides high-performance computing hardware and software solutions to clients for processing cloud and AI workloads. In the first quarter of 2025, data center revenue grew 57% year over year to $3.67 billion, making up almost half of AMD's total revenue. Data center AI business revenue also increased by a double-digit percentage year over year, driven by increased shipments of the MI325X accelerators for new cloud and enterprise workloads. Image source: Getty Images. With AI inferencing costs escalating rapidly, AMD is in a better position to capture a bigger share of the AI market. Its Instinct GPUs are known to offer superior price performance than competitors. Here are some more reasons why the company may prove to be a surprise AI winner in 2025. AMD's data center business is experiencing robust momentum, driven by solid demand for its EPYC server processors and Instinct AI accelerators. AMD accounted for 25.1% share of the server CPU market, up 2 percentage points year over year, as EPYC server processors continue to be in high demand from both cloud players and enterprise customers. All major cloud players are engaging with the company in the development of fifth-generation EPYC CPUs, codenamed \"Turin.\" EPYC processors are also in high demand from enterprise customers across a range of industries and functions. The company expects enterprise adoption of EPYC processors to further accelerate, as more than 150 server platforms  using these chips will become broadly available in the coming quarters. The company's data center AI business is also gaining traction. Multiple Tier 1 cloud and enterprise customers have opted for AMD's Instinct AI accelerators in the first quarter. These clients include one of the largest frontier model developers, which has deployed Instinct GPUs to cater to a significant portion of its daily AI inferencing workloads. AMD has also started sampling the next-generation MI350 series GPUs with several customers and is on track for production by mid-2025. With MI350 offering higher performance, memory capacity, bandwidth, support for new data types, and network efficiency as compared to the MI300 series, AMD expects strong deployment for these chips in the second half of 2025. Furthermore, the company is gearing up for the launch of MI400 series GPUs in 2026. AMD is also focusing on strengthening its software ecosystem, mainly its ROCm software stack for programming the company's GPUs. Instead of releasing quarterly ROCm updates, the company is now delivering them on a biweekly basis. The company has also increased access to its Instinct compute infrastructure for open-source developers to build, test, and deploy updates to the ROCm stack on a nightly basis. Subsequently, 2 million models on the open-source Hugging Face platform are running directly on AMD hardware without needing any special customization. The company is also ensuring that newly released AI models can run without hiccups on Instinct accelerators immediately after launch. Finally, the recent acquisition of ZT Systems is enabling AMD to sell fully integrated AI systems, instead of just hardware components. All these AI initiatives can dramatically expand AMD's data center business in the coming years. AMD's client segment also reported a strong 68% year-over-year revenue jump to $2.3 billion in the first quarter. The company experienced record client CPU average selling prices (ASPs), driven by increased demand for its high-end desktop and Ryzen processors in gaming and commercial segments. While AMD's processors are increasingly adopted in gaming desktops, the company is also seeing rising demand in the mobile computing market. Furthermore, sales of the company's latest-generation AI-capable processors also grew more than 50% quarter over quarter in the first quarter. AMD is also making its presence felt in the commercial PC space, with the company closing deals with large enterprises across several industries. Despite the solid tailwinds, AMD's shares are currently trading at 21.7 times forward earnings, significantly lower than Nvidia's forward P/E multiple  of 25.4. While investors should not ignore the short-term revenue headwind arising from the export control restrictions for Instinct MI308 shipments to China, the fundamentals of the company are still strong. Hence, with a diversified product portfolio spanning various segments such as data center, gaming, and client; a robust balance sheet with $7.3 billion in cash; and a reasonable valuation position, AMD appears an attractive pick now.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After several months in the wilderness, Nvidia Corp. shares have found their way again as doubts about Big Tech spending subside, trade tensions with China ease, and new chip buyers emerge. Most Read from Bloomberg As Coastline Erodes, One California City Considers \u2018Retreat Now\u2019 How a Highway Became San Francisco\u2019s Newest Park Maryland\u2019s Credit Rating Gets Downgraded as Governor Blames Trump Power-Hungry Data Centers Are Warming Homes in the Nordics NYC Commuters Brace for Chaos as NJ Transit Strike Looms The stock rallied this week and is on track for the best month in a year after a series of long-term sales agreements during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East. That followed a tariff detente between the US and China and an earnings season that showed Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers remain full-steam ahead on capital spending related to artificial intelligence infrastructure, where the chipmaker dominates. The stock has now advanced 43% from an April low and is less than 6% from where it closed on Jan. 24, the day before the emergence of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model sparked fears that cheaper AI development would hurt sales, sending Nvidia and other technology stocks tumbling. \u201cThis season showed that the hyperscalers continue to increase their estimates for what they\u2019re going to spend, and Nvidia remains the primary beneficiary of that capex,\u201d said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. \u201cEveryone wants off the train before the party stops, but I don\u2019t know why they expect it to stop.\u201d With respect to spending on AI, \u201cI think we\u2019re in the second inning of a nine-inning game.\u201d Since the start of the month, Nvidia has blown through both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, positive technical signals for both its near- and long-term momentum. The rally has added about $1 trillion in market capitalization since its April low, pushing it ahead of Apple Inc. in market capitalization. At $3.29 trillion, Nvidia is now second only to Microsoft Corp.\u2019s $3.37 trillion among the world\u2019s biggest stocks. Nvidia\u2019s latest rally marks a stark turnaround from the biggest drawdown in the stock since 2022. At its low last month, the chipmaker\u2019s shares had fallen 37% from a January all-time high amid concerns that Big Tech\u2019s chip-buying binge was set to cool and trade hostilities between the US and China threatened a key market. Instead of pulling back, tech giants upped the ante. Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. pledged to spend even more next year, while Meta Platforms Inc. raised its forecast for capital expenditures on the back of AI-related demand tailwinds. Along with Amazon.com Inc., capital expenditures for the four companies are projected to reach nearly $330 billion in 2026, up 6% from estimated spending this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. While risks of a negative shift in US trade policies with regard to China remain, Wall Street has been encouraged by new business opportunities in the Middle East. Bank of America on Wednesday raised its price target on Nvidia to $160 from $150 and reiterated its buy rating on the stock. Analyst Vivek Arya estimated commitments for an infrastructure project in Saudi Arabia reported this week could generate as much as $5 billion annually for Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and help offset lost sales as a result of chip export restrictions on China. Wall Street remains almost uniformly positive on the stock, as 87% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying, and it trades 20% below the average analyst price target, making for the second-highest implied return among Magnificent Seven stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. \u2018Attractive\u2019 Profile Meanwhile, the valuation on Nvidia shares has staged a comeback from the cheapest relative to anticipated profits since 2019, but it remains below the long-term average. After the shares briefly traded under 20 times earnings estimated over the next 12 months, they are now priced at 28 times, compared with an average of almost 35 times over the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 Index carries a multiple of 21.6. Nvidia is expected to grow revenue 54% in its 2026 fiscal year, which finishes at the end of January. The company is due to report it\u2019s next batch of earnings after the market close on May 28. Revenue growth in the S&P 500 is expected to be 4.4% this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThere\u2019s usually a cost for owning the kind of growth Nvidia offers, but the valuation isn\u2019t far from multi-year lows or the overall market, which is a testament to how attractive the investment profile is,\u201d said Andre Bakhos, president of Ingenium Analytics. \u201cRight now all the metrics are playing out in Nvidia\u2019s favor: the technical strength in the stock, the valuation, and the growth profile, especially with new markets in the Middle East. That just shows you how hard it is to break a trend when the fundamentals are so sound.\u201d Tech Chart of the Day China\u2019s long-moribund tech sector started 2025 with a bang, but as the year\u2019s first quarterly earnings season got underway this week, investors got a wake-up call.

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 16, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Oracle Corp. ORCL. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition toNVIDIA Corp.by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Humain, the query arises on AMD\u2019s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let\u2019s analyze. Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn\u2019t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it\u2019s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According toBank of America Corp.analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD\u2019s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA\u2019s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can\u2019t afford NVIDIA\u2019s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That\u2019s whyMicrosoft Corp.is using AMD\u2019s MI300X chips, andOracle Corp.has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD\u2019s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA\u2019s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA\u2019s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA\u2019s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93. Whereas, brokers have increased AMD\u2019s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?). While AMD may not surpass NVIDIA\u2019s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management\u2019s optimism about the company\u2019s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "header": "1 Surprisingly Cheap Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.52%)is now one of the largest companies in the world. When it comes toAI stocks, Nvidia tops the list. The company produces the most sought-after component for the AI industry: specialized GPUs (graphics processing units) that allow for the training and deployment of complex artificial models. Despite a market cap of roughly $3 trillion, Nvidia shares are surprisingly cheap according to one popular metric. Nearly every AI application used globally today -- whether it's a consumer product like ChatGPT or a neural network used only by a few companies -- leverages cloud computing infrastructure to run. Otherwise, AI developers would need to buy their own infrastructure, adding considerable expense and time. And when it came time to scale up the business, those developers would need to buy even more infrastructure, making scaling up both costly and a long-term project. Cloud infrastructure allows dynamic scaling using rented servers that can operate anywhere. What do all those servers run on? Specialized chips called GPUs. Amazingly, Nvidia controls around 90% of the market for data center GPUs, a reflection of its early investment and strategic vision. The company's GPUs are so in demand that its latest generation was sold out for 12 months at one point. The company's gross margins are also considerably higher than those of competitors likeAdvanced Micro DevicesandIntel, a testament to how much end users crave Nvidia's GPUs. Nvidia is sitting on a dominant market position just as the AI industry takes off. The United Nations, for instance, believes the AI market will grow from $189 billion in 2023 to nearly $5 trillion by 2033. According to some metrics, Nvidia shares look very expensive, a result of all this potential growth being baked into today's stock price. But according to one critical metric, shares remain surprisingly cheap. You would think that a high-quality stock with such an exciting long-term growth trajectory would be priced at a steep discount. Make no mistake: Nvidia is priced at a healthy premium to the market. But shares aren't as expensive as you'd suspect, especially when you look at its earnings power. With theS&P 500trading at 28 times earnings, Nvidia shares trade at a premium of around 44 times earnings. But its earnings growth is far higher than that of the average S&P 500 company. Pricing in the next 12 months of expected profit growth, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at just under 30 times earnings -- a much more palatable price to pay.  NVDA PS Ratiodata byYCharts A few years down the road, Nvidia shares could be priced very similarly to the S&P 500 based on today's purchase price. That's an incredible bargain for such a profitable company, one that should grow by heavy double digits for many, many years to come. The trick here is patience. Investors must be willing to hold on long enough for that initial premium to be justified through long-term growth. Nvidia is a classic example of how patient investors can secure an attractive bargain on blue-chip stocks like Nvidia. The only special ingredient you'll need is time. But based on the company's dominant market share and the high growth of its underlying market, this is a stock for which patience could pay off big years down the road.",

        "header": "3 Reasons Why Nvidia Is Still a Must-Own Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.52%)has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market since early 2023, but some investors are starting to wonder if its incredible run is running out of steam. I'm not in that group. The economy is still in the early stages of what is shaping up to be a generational shift, and Nvidia is right at the heart of it. There are plenty of reasons investors should hang on to their Nvidia shares (or buy more). But I want to focus on three that have me convinced that Nvidia is still a must-own stock. Image source: Nvidia. In terms of overall excellence, Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)are best in class, which explains why its products are so dominant. GPUs are designed to handle tough computing tasks due to their ability to process multiple calculations in parallel. This gives them a leg up in processing tasks like artificial intelligence (AI) model training. In a separate but related issue, GPUs have been integral to facilitating the move from on-premise computing to cloud computing, powering the data centers that make cloud computing work. The buildout of AI and the data centers to facilitate AI processing is scaling up at a fast pace, but recent concerns about a global economic slowdown and rising uncertainty related to ever-changing tariff policies has left some investors wondering what effects this will have on Nvidia. At the moment, most AI hyperscalers have confirmed plans to spend record amounts on building data centers, which is excellent news for Nvidia. Even better, Nvidia expects this increased spending to persist over multiple years. Using third-party data, Nvidia estimated that about $400 billion was spent on data center capital expenditures in 2024. Nvidia management expects that to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. Because of their size, data centers take years of planning to build, so growth of this magnitude over the next few years is quite plausible. Data centers have grown to become Nvidia's biggest business segment, and it looks like it will grow even bigger going forward. Artificial intelligence usage has certainly ramped up over the past few years, but it's nowhere near peak usage. Businesses worldwide are still working on integrating AI into their operations, which will require more computing power to support the increased workloads. A survey from North Carolina's Elon University estimates that 52% of U.S. adults have used agenerative AI modelat least once. Of this group, only 24% said they used AI for work activities. For frequency of use, only 34% said that they use it once daily, and 10% said that they use it constantly. So, there's still a lot of room for growth with generative AI tools, and Nvidia will benefit from this buildout. Somewhere along the way, Nvidia gained a reputation for being an expensive stock. While it has sometimes had what would be considered an expensive valuation, its valuation is relatively reasonable right now. Nvidia stock trades for about28 times forward earnings, which isn't bad considering that many of its big tech peers trade in this valuation range.  Data byYCharts. Nvidia's stock might be considered relatively expensive using the trailing earnings metric (42 times earnings), but using the trailing earnings metric doesn't give Nvidia any credit for the growth it's about to deliver. Essentially, Nvidia has about one year's worth of growth baked into the stock price, so if it can continue growing at a good pace over the next year (and there are already monster data center growth projections out there, as discussed above), the stock will justify its current price. Nvidia is a top investment in the AI realm because of its universal usage. As long as AI continues to become more popular,Nvidia will continue to be a successful stock pick.",

        "content": "By Julie Zhu and Clare Jim HONG KONG (Reuters) -Nvidia is seeking a site in Shanghai for a research and development centre, three sources close to the matter said, reflecting the strategic significance of the Chinese market where U.S. curbs on advanced chip exports have hit sales. The U.S. chipmaker began the search in early 2025 and is primarily evaluating locations in Shanghai's Minhang and Xuhui districts, one of the sources said. The project gained momentum after a surprise visit to China by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month, said two of the sources. Huang, who has consistently said China is critical to Nvidia's growth, made his visit immediately after the U.S. placed new restrictions on China-bound shipments of its H20 chips, the only AI chip the company can sell legally in China. Huang met senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier He Lifeng and Shanghai's mayor Gong Zheng. Reuters reported earlier this month that Nvidia plans to release a downgraded version of the H20 chip for China in the next two months, as it seeks to prop up sales in the country, where it has been lost market share to domestic rivals such as Huawei. China generated $17 billion in revenue for Nvidia in the fiscal year ending January 26, accounting for 13% of the company's total sales. The local government of Shanghai, which hosts China's largest foreign business community, including firms such as Tesla, has expressed willingness to offer incentives for the Nvidia project, including tax reductions, said two of the sources. The local authorities are also considering offering a substantial amount of land to Nvidia for its China R&D centre, one source added. Nvidia declined to comment, while the Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources declined to be named, as the plan is not public. Following his visit to China, Huang told CNBC that the country's AI market could reach approximately $50 billion within the next two-to-three years. He said that being excluded from this rapidly expanding sector would represent a \"tremendous loss\" for Nvidia, especially as competition with Huawei intensifies. During an earnings call in February, before H20 chip sales to China were restricted, Nvidia executives said the company's sales to China were about half the level before U.S. export controls. Since 2022, the U.S. government has imposed restrictions on the export of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China, citing concerns over potential military applications. The Financial Times first reported on Friday about Nvidia's plan to build a R&D centre in China.

        "header": "How Much Will Installing a Panic Room Cost You?",
        "content": "Over the last decade, the number of Americansactively preparing for disasterhas skyrocketed. According to FEMA data, the number of self-identified \u201cpreppers\u201d has nearly doubled since 2017, reaching 20 million. Part of that preparation sometimes includes a \u201cpanic room\u201d or bunker to keep themselves safe in an emergency. While custom-built, multi-room underground shelters with advanced security systems can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more), simpler pre-fabricated options installed above-ground can be much more affordable and accessible. So, how much will installing a panic room really run you? Below, we break down potential costs involved and the factors that influence them. A growing concern over civil unrest, crime, and worsening natural disasters has driven many Americans to consider investing in emergency preparations like a panic room. A 2023 Finder survey found that 29% of U.S. adults spent a collective $11 billion on emergency preparedness in 12 months. A dedicated space, like a panic room or bunker, allows you to stockpile necessities and stay protected from the outside world in times of chaos. For disaster-prepared homeowners, having this access can provide comfort and security for themselves and their families. Colorado-based general contractorChris Hock, owner of Earth Saving Solutions and Colorado Homes and Design, says he hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to build a panic room yet, but they frequently appear in his social media feeds. \u201cI\u2019ve done quite a bit of research on [panic rooms] over the years,\u201d Hock said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen homes with extensive food storage and a growing demand for backup power. Solar systems with backup batteries have been particularly relevant in Colorado.\u201d Panic room costs can drastically differ from one project to the next, ranging from a few thousand to a few million dollars. The price ultimately depends on project scope, materials, and desired features. Here\u2019s what you can expect to pay for different types of panic rooms, based on data from Home Guide. Because panic rooms aren't cheap, before you contract with an expert to build it, consider how you mightpay for thatand if you'll need totake out a loan. As with any construction project, your preferences and specifications can greatly impact the total cost of a panic room. The more protection and safety features you want, the more expensive your build will be, said Hock. \u201cYou have to think about the complexity of materials, design choices, and ongoing maintenance,\u201d he said. Here are a few key factors that might drive up your total cost. Many panic rooms and bunkers are made of steel, but safely burying them underground requires reinforced concrete.Ryan Meagher, pre-construction manager at BVM Contracting, said that concrete is typically the biggest material cost involved in an underground panic room build. The average cost of concrete walls is $90 to $320 per linear foot, so the larger your structure, the higher your costs will be. \u201cUnderstanding how much concrete will be needed and the type of reinforcements needed will be an important cost consideration,\u201d Meagher said. Meagher said utilities are a big cost consideration for a panic room or bunker, including backup power for electricity in the case of a power outage, plumbing and fresh water supply, ventilation, and HVAC. Greenhouses, which are ideal for self-sustainability, can range from $2,500 to $15,000, plus additional lighting and watering systems. \u201cAdding elements like hydroponics for growing food underground is possible, but you need to consider the necessity of these features based on your budget,\u201d Hock said. Hock noted that building a panic room or bunker into a new construction project is much easier than adding one to an existing property. \u201cIf the bunker is part of the original home design, the project costs can be much more reasonable from the start,\u201d he explained. \u201cAdditionally, theamenitieswill be better integrated, and the owners and their families will potentially be safer.\u201d Hock said it\u2019s still \u201cabsolutely feasible\u201d to retrofit an existing home with an above or below-ground panic room\u2014though the cost and complexity of your project will increase. \u201cLots of testing will be necessary,\u201d he added. \u201cConsider water tables, soil testing, city codes, and property lines.\u201d No matter what type of panic room project you\u2019re interested in, it\u2019s wise to work with a professional who has experience in thesetypes of home renovationsto ensure your panic room is built correctly. \u201cMake sure you have detailed architectural drawings,\u201d Meagher said. \u201cWorking with an architectural partner that has experience specifying the correct wall configurations and other details for your panic room is paramount in having the construction executed properly.\u201d Once you find a contractor, Hock advised communicating clearly with them about the intended purpose of your panic room, as this can inform which features are most important to the build. \u201cUnderstand why you want this space, whether it\u2019s for natural disaster protection, home invasion security, or long-term self-sufficiency in the event of nuclear fallout,\u201d he said. \u201cBudget realistically and prioritize quality to ensure your safety and peace of mind.\u201d Finally, you'll have to decidehow to pay for your project, whether it's cash, ahome improvement loan, a home equity line of credit (HELOC), credit cards, or a combination of options. For some Americans, no price is too high toprotect their family and property. A panic room or bunker can give you peace of mind about your security and ability to navigate an emergency situation. As with any construction project, it\u2019s important to assess your needs, budget, and available options to understand all the costs involved in building your panic room.",

        "content": "Shares in data center equipment company andNvidiapartnerVertiv Holdings(VRT-3.83%)rose by 12% in the week ending Friday morning. The move was prompted by positive newsflow for the artificial intelligence (AI)/data center sector. Here's the lowdown. The news of an easing, albeit temporary, of tariffs between the U.S. and China is a positive for trade relations between the two countries and a plus for global growth prospects. It helps encourage spending ondata centersand eases the cost pressure on companies with operations in China or those that source products directly from China. Vertiv benefits from both developments. If data center spending slows in response to an uncertain economic outlook created by tariffs, then Vertiv's order growth could slow. Turning to the issue of Vertiv's cost exposure to China, management previously outlined that a \"single-digit percentage of supply for U.S. factories is sourced from China.\" Still, it declined to give more granular detail on its tariff-related exposure. However, you can see its potential financial impact in its guidance. For example, Vertiv raised the midpoint of full-year sales guidance from $9.2 billion to a new estimate of $9.45 billion  on the back of an excellent first quarter. On the other hand, the potential impact of tariffs caused management to lower the midpoint of its full-year adjusted operating margin guidance to 20.5% from 21%. Image source: Getty Images. As such, the de-escalation in the tariff conflict could lead to an upgrade to earnings expectations if margins improve, as itsunderlying growth in orders and sales is excellent, and the data center spending environmentremains robust.",

The planned cash-and-stock deal values Atlanta-based Cox Communications at around $34.5 billion, including debt, the companies said. The Cox family will be the largest shareholder in the combined company with a stake of around 23%. The family, which holds its stake in Cox via Cox Enterprises, will get $4 billion in cash and access to shares in Stamford, Connecticut-based Charter. The deal requires the approval of regulators and Charter shareholders to close. The combined company will be headquartered in Stamford and will be renamed Cox Communications within a year of the transaction closing, the companies said. Charter is the parent of internet, mobile phone, and pay-TV provider Spectrum, which will be the consumer-facing brand after the deal.

        "content": "For retail investors, a fundamental question emerges: Should you try totime the marketto buy low and sell high, or invest consistently regardless of market conditions? Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)\u2014investing equal amounts at regular intervals regardless of market conditions\u2014is widely championed by financial advisors as a disciplined approach that reduces risk and emotional decisions. \"Dollar-cost averaging into quality investments\u2014thinkETFs[exchange-traded funds], blue-chip stocks, and even undervalued sectors like utilities or health care\u2014can be powerful,\" Stoy Hall, CEO and founder of Black Mammoth, told Investopedia. Meanwhile, attempting to buy at market lows and sell at highs potentially maximizes returns but requires precision that even professional investors struggle to achieve. As volatility shakes the markets, understanding which approach better serves your financial goals is crucial. Investors are often split between those looking for \"time in the market\" (seeking gains from long-term investing) versus those trying to \"time the market\" (those buying the dip and so on). \"To figure out your style, pay attention to how you feel during different market situations,\" Yvan Byeajee, author ofTrading Composure: Mastering Your Mind for Trading Success, told Investopedia. \"By reflecting on these emotional responses and aligning them with your strategy, you'll start to define a style that fits you best, which means that your decisions will feel more natural and effective.\" DCA provides a consistent routine without difficult decisions during turbulence. David Tenerelli, a financial advisor at Values Added Financial, said that for more people trying to time the market is a \"folly.\" But that doesn't mean DCA is always easy emotionally. \"It takes discipline to continue tobuy investments during a market downturn,\" he said. \"A shift in mindset can help\u2014rather than fearing financial loss, an investor can reframe it as buying stocks 'on sale.'\" DCA's biggest drawback appears during strongbull markets, where early lump-sum investing would yield higher returns\u2014assuming you had both the money on hand and foresight to time it right. \"Forget trying to 'time the bottom,'\" Hall said. \"Nobody knows when that hits, not even the so-called experts.\" Market timing sounds appealing in theory\u2014buy low, sell high, and maximize returns. However, executing this strategy successfully requires predicting market movements with remarkable accuracy, a feat that even professional investors rarely achieve consistently. Researchers have compared how different strategies would have performed over time. Research in theJournal of Financial Issues, which analyzed 30 years of S&P 500 data, compared DCA against three market timing strategies. Over this period, DCA produced a 254% return, outperforming market timing approaches (whose net returns ranged from 227% to 252%). Only a theoretical \"perfect foresight\" strategy\u2014assuming impossible market prediction abilities\u2014consistently outperformed DCA, with a 289% return. Other studies looking at different periods provide additional nuance. Galaxy Asset Management looking atcryptoand S&P 500 fund data from 2007 to 2024, found DCA coming out ahead for both kinds of assets. \"Dollar-cost averaging simplifies investing,mitigates emotional biases, and often delivers better outcomes than buying the dip, even in extreme market scenarios,\" it concluded. Other researchers have found that modifying DCA\u2014say, by attempting to buy more shares atmarket lows\u2014can provide more benefits than market timing or DCA alone.This happens to match, in fact, what many investors already do: practice DCA while setting aside a small percentage to \"play the market.\" While market timing might occasionally produce great results, DCA offers a more reliable path for most investors, particularly those investing for long-term goals likeretirement. By reducing the impact of marketvolatilityon your investment decisions and creating a disciplined investment habit, this strategy helps overcome the psychological barriers that often prevent long-term growth.",

The center comes as China accounted for 14% of Nvidia's revenueabout $17 billionin fiscal 2024, and Jensen Huang estimates that could swell to $50 billion within a few years. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Nvidia's China sales have been dented by U.S. export curbs and Trump-era tariffs, and the company is under pressure from Huawei's chip push, so the new facility aims to address complex technical requirements under White House restrictions while keeping chip design and production offshore to protect intellectual property. Beyond China-specific R&D, the Shanghai hub will optimize existing products and explore adjacent markets like autonomous driving, while tapping elite Chinese AI talent to strengthen its competitive moat. The FT reports that local authorities have given preliminary support and that Nvidia has lobbied Washington for export-license approval. President Trump himself praised Huang on a recent overseas trip, noting Nvidia's estimated 99% market share in advanced AI chips.

        "content": "If you sold stocks during the market turmoil this year and captured a loss on that sale, you might consider using a tactic known astax-loss harvestingto help you save money on taxes. \u201cAt a basic level, tax-loss harvesting is selling an investment for a loss, on paper, and using it to reduce your taxes,\u201d saysFilip Telibasa, a certified financial planner and owner of Benzina Wealth. \u201cLosses can either be used to offset gains realized in other areas or to reduce up to $3,000 of your income.\u201d Here\u2019s what you need to know about using the strategy. Tax-loss harvesting can be a good strategy to use in a volatile stock market, helping you take advantage of any losses you may experience. \u201cAvolatile marketis the best time to use tax-loss harvesting since there is a lot of movement and therefore opportunities to capture short-term losses,\u201d Telibasa says. In addition to saving you money on taxes, tax-loss harvesting can help torebalance your portfolio. \u201cYour investments\u00a0are out of balance when individual positions move in different directions. By selling positions at a loss, it helps to even things out,\u201d Telibasa says. Another thing to keep in mind is that a loss can be carried over from one year to the next. \u201cWhen you sell an investment at a loss, you can use that loss to offset gains from other investments you sold at a profit. If your losses exceed your gains, you can use up to $3,000 of that excess to reduce yourordinary incomefor the year,\u201d saysAlvin Carlos, certified financial planner and founder of District Capital Management. \u201cAny remaining losses carry forward to future tax years. This can result in a smaller tax bill today and help soften the tax impact of gains in the future.\u201d According to the IRS, awash saleoccurs when you sell a security at a loss and acquire the same \u201csubstantially identical\u201d security within 30 days of the sale date, both before and after the sale date. When this occurs, the taxpayer cannot deduct the loss on the security. \u201cThe purpose of this rule is to prevent investors from selling assets\u00a0purely\u00a0to generate a tax loss and then immediately repurchasing the same or very similar assets to maintain their investment position,\u201d saysAustin Lee, a certified financial planner and founder of Lee Financial Group. To avoid a wash sale, stick with buying a similar but not identical stock following tax-loss harvesting. \u201cAvoid buying the same or substantially identical security, such as the sameETForstock, within 30 days before or after the sale,\u201d saysChristopher Stroup, a certified financial planner and founder of Silicon Beach Financial. \u201cInstead, swap into a similar but not identical holding. For example, if you sell an S&P 500 index fund, consider buying a total market fund to maintain exposure.\u201d Another way to avoid a wash sale is to wait 31 days or longer from the date of the sale to make a new purchase. Tax-loss harvesting cannot be applied to retirement accounts, as these accounts are tax-deferred already. \u201cTax-loss harvesting only applies to taxablebrokerage accounts. Retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs grow tax-deferred, so gains and losses inside them don\u2019t affect your annual tax bill,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t harvest losses in those accounts;\u00a0there\u2019s no tax to offset.\u201d Tax-loss harvesting is one way to make up for losses in the stock market. Selling at a loss will help to offset gains from other investments and will lower your tax bill. There are a lot of losses with a volatile stock market, so it is a good time to consider this tactic, which can only be used in taxable brokerage accounts. Just be careful about the investment you choose before and after the sale of a loss. If you make an investment that is substantially identical to the one you sold at a loss within 30 days before or after the sale, you won\u2019t be able to deduct the loss on yourtax return. To avoid this, choose to buy similar but not identical investments within the 30 days before or after the sale of a loss, or wait 31 days or longer to make a new purchase. Both strategies will allow you to deduct a loss on your tax return.",

(BRK.A,BRK.B), but his investment philosophy will continue to be a force in the market, not least through investment products aiming to replicate his value investing approach. WhileWarren Buffetthimself has said retail investors should rely mostly on broad index exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a new ETF launched in March 2025 claims to offer investors bothBuffett-style equity exposureand something Berkshire has famously never provided\u2014monthly income. The VistaShares Target 15 Berkshire Select Income ETF (OMAH) maintains a basket of Berkshire Hathaway's most representative equity holdings, while adding an options strategy designed to generate an annual income of 15%, distributed monthly. For investors who have long admired Buffett's investment acumen but want the dividends that Berkshire doesn't provide, this ETF could have potential. But is it really investing like Buffett, and does the income strategy justify the 0.95% expense ratio, especially with other Buffett-inspired investments available? The VistaShares Target 15 Berkshire Select Income ETF provides a monthly dividend through a dual strategy: Income-generating options strategies like the one used in OMAH typically involve sellingcovered calloptions against the ETF's stock holdings. This approach has become increasingly popular among ETF issuers seeking to provide income during periods of market volatility. There are ironies with this ETF offering. Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay dividends. An irony that for some lurches into contradiction is the expense ratio of 0.95%\u2014Buffett famously advises retail investors to seek out only low-cost funds. For investors seeking to truly \"invest like Buffett,\" the most straightforward approach would be to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock, offered in less-expensive fractional shares and BRK.B versions. This grants direct exposure to Buffett's and his chosen executives' investment decisions. Berkshire has tripled theS&P 500 Index's performance over the past year and delivered a 203% five-year return, double the broader market (as of May 2025). But Berkshire pays nodividends\u2014Buffett's team prefers reinvesting cash\u2014creating a market opportunity for OMAH. But it's not the only ETF looking to capture market share by using Buffett's approach: As the Oracle of Omaha leaves his perch at Berkshire, many investors will be looking beyond Berkshire for ways to invest the Buffett way.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI plans to help develop a massive new data center in the United Arab Emirates that may eventually be one of the largest in the world, a major bet on the Middle East and a significant expansion of the company\u2019s global AI infrastructure ambitions. Most Read from Bloomberg As Coastline Erodes, One California City Considers \u2018Retreat Now\u2019 How a Highway Became San Francisco\u2019s Newest Park Maryland\u2019s Credit Rating Gets Downgraded as Governor Blames Trump NJ Transit Train Engineers Strike, Disrupting Travel to NYC Power-Hungry Data Centers Are Warming Homes in the Nordics The ChatGPT maker is expected to be one of the primary anchor tenants for a recently announced 5-gigawatt data center campus in Abu Dhabi, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans are not public. OpenAI\u2019s participation is not yet finalized, said the people, but a formal announcement may come in the near term. Once completed, the sprawling facility would cover 10 square miles and use roughly as much power as five nuclear reactors \u2013 far larger than any site the ChatGPT maker or its closest rivals have announced to date. Not all of the 5 gigawatts will go to OpenAI, one person said, but rather be shared by multiple firms. Bloomberg News previously reported that OpenAI was weighing a facility in the UAE. US and UAE officials said Thursday that G42, the Abu Dhabi-based AI company with historic ties to China, would be building a 5-gigawatt data center in collaboration with several unnamed US companies. The news came the same day that President Donald Trump visited the country as part of his dealmaking tour of the Middle East. Officials on the ground were still in negotiations about potential AI deals for the UAE during the president\u2019s visit. MGX, an Abu Dhabi investment vehicle, is also considering participating in the data center project alongside OpenAI and G42, one person said. Other US partners may get involved too, the person said. OpenAI declined to comment. Representatives for G42, MGX and the US Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment. The planned campus is part of OpenAI\u2019s Stargate initiative to support AI development, two people said. OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announced Stargate alongside Trump in January, and said the joint venture would invest up to $500 billion in US projects over the next four years. Earlier this month, OpenAI said it was looking to partner with international governments to develop more AI data centers beyond the US and promote American leadership in the field. With the UAE project, OpenAI will effectively help the Middle East rapidly gain ground in offering the infrastructure needed for AI services \u2013 and also achieve an ambitious goal that the company had originally set for the US. Late last year, OpenAI pitched the Biden administration on the need for data centers with capacity as high as 5 gigawatts \u2014 an unprecedented target that raised questions about how to power such facilities. Now it\u2019s participating in a project of a similar scale abroad before getting a comparably sized one off the ground in the US. OpenAI\u2019s first Stargate campus in the US is expected to be 1.2 gigawatts. The company also plans to build as many as 10 more sites on American soil. Related: Trump\u2019s Mideast Visit Spurs Flood of AI Deals Led by Nvidia The UAE data center campus is the focal point of a broader bilateral framework to facilitate more AI collaboration between the US and UAE. The accord could involve the sale of more than a million high-end Nvidia Corp. chips to the Gulf nation. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader strategy to accelerate the use of American technology in AI development throughout the world \u2014 with the aim of preventing China from capturing Middle Eastern and other markets. But some officials in the Trump administration are worried about the strategic implications of what they consider an offshoring of American AI capabilities, according to people familiar with the matter. The officials have also raised national security concerns about sharing advanced US semiconductors, the gold standard for developing and training AI models, with companies and countries that have deep China ties, Bloomberg News has reported. OpenAI has had a long relationship with the UAE, dating back to a 2023 partnership with G42. MGX participated in OpenAI\u2019s $6.6 billion funding round that closed in October and also plans to contribute to Stargate.

        "content": "President Trump wants Apple (AAPL) to make iPhones in the U.S. Wall Street analysts say that's not likely to happen. \u201cWe see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the U.S. given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed,\u201d Wedbush analysts said Friday. \u201cThis would result in an iPhoneprice pointthat is a non-starter.\u201d The firm estimates that an American-made iPhone would cost $3,500. The company's iPhone 16 currently starts at $799, with the iPhone 16 Pro starting at $999. The comments come after Trump on Thursday said he told Apple CEO Tim Cook tostop expandingiPhone production in India, and pushed the company to move operations stateside instead, as it shifts away from manufacturing in China. Cook has said thata majorityof iPhones sold in the U.S. this quarter will come from India, rather than China. \"I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him, Tim, you're my friend.

        "header": "Intel's new chip manufacturing technology is its greatest hope for a turnaround \u2014 and its biggest risk",
        "content": "Intel's (INTC) efforts to restore the chip giant to its former glory may hinge on a new manufacturing process the company calls 18A. Short for 18 angstroms \u2014 an angstrom is equal to 0.1 nanometers \u2014 18A is, according to Wall Street analysts and chip industry experts,Intel's last hope to take back the semiconductor crownfrom rival TSMC (TSM). Available later this year, 18A takes advantage of two manufacturing techniques that TSMC isn't using yet: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. Intel says the technologies will improve its chips' performance and efficiency. But Intel isn't just using 18A to reclaim its place as a leading chipmaker. The company is also banking on using the technology to move in on TSMC's contract manufacturing business by building 18A-based chips for itself and custom versions for third-party customers. But that'll prove difficult. TSMC already builds chips for companies including AMD, Apple, and Nvidia. Intel opened up its manufacturing business to outside clients in 2021 under former CEO Pat Gelsinger. ButWall Street analysts and executives grew exasperated with his strategy and what they saw as unrealistic goals for the business, which lost $13.4 billion in 2024 despite recording a revenue of $17.5 billion. So far, Amazon and Microsoft have signed on to build their own chips using Intel's 18A process, with the hope that others will follow suit. But CFO David Zinsner says third-party commitments are \"not significant\" yet,according to Reuters. Intel's 18A is so important because it's introducing two technologies to the company's chips at once. First, it's taking advantage of gate-all-around transistors \u2014next-generation transistorsthat can more actively control the flow of electricity through a chip. It's also using a technique called backside power, which changes where and how power is delivered to a chip's transistors to enable more efficiency and better performance. Together, the two technologies would help improve AI application performance without running into energy constraints, UC Santa Barbara engineering professor Kaustav Banerjee told Yahoo Finance. That would cut down on problems like overheating \u2014something that reportedly plagued Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs)when they were in development. Taking first-mover advantage in the chip industry typically means big wins for a semiconductor manufacturer. Intel's founders invented modern semiconductors, and the chipmaker wasthe first to successfully manufacture a new kind of transistor called Finfet in 2011. But TSMC flipped the script in 2019 when it became the firstto successfully use advanced chipmaking technology called EUV lithography\u2014 massive machines worth hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 to make semiconductors, which helped it soar past Intel and make the world's most advanced AI chips for companies including Apple and Nvidia. That's not all. Intel also already had to delay the rollout of 18A from the first half of 2025 to the second half, according to the company's previous earnings calls. Trying to perfect both backside power and gate-all-around transistors at once introduces greater manufacturing complexity and greater room for error. \"Both of these technologies [are] enormously complex on [their] own,\" Chris Miller, author of \"Chip War,\" told Yahoo Finance. \"So it's even harder to do them simultaneously.\" A manufacturing employee at Intel's foundry in Oregon told Yahoo Finance on the condition of anonymity that the technology wasn't ready for external customers in December. In a follow-up interview in March, however, they said 18A \"has gotten a lot better\" and Intel staffers are \"optimistic\" about it. Another manufacturing employee at the fab said 18A is \"on track.\" Still, they worried thatIntel's planned layoffscould depress morale and hinder their work toward getting the process out the door. TSMC isn't sitting idly by, though. The company is also launching gate-all-around transistors through its N2 technology, which it plans to release later this year. It's also working to add backside power to its chips in 2026. Ensuring 18A works is only part of the equation. Intel also has to prove it can sign up customers to take advantage of the technology for their own chips and can pump them out in the volumes they need. \"Can they do it? Yes, they can do it,\" Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said. \"But can they do it with the kind of yield and scale like TSMC? That, I think, remains to be seen.\" Gelsinger staked part of Intel's revival on his plans to turn the company into a third-party foundry. Tan appears to be set to stick to that plan. And while Intel expects its foundry business, which has been hemorrhaging money, to break even by 2027, Wall Street may not be willing to wait that long. Various analysts have called for Intel to ditch its third-party foundry, and even get out of the chip manufacturing business entirely, and stick to designing semiconductors like rivals AMD and Nvidia. But since Intel is the US's sole large-scale advanced chip manufacturer, the government is keen on keeping its manufacturing arm intact. Intel has secured $7.8 billion in US CHIPS Act funding, andditching its foundry would put that funding at risk. \"The US doesn't want to be exclusively dependent on foreign firms for advanced production and R&D. Right now, Intel is the only firm with advanced R&D in the United States,\" author Chris Miller explained. While TSMC is expanding its US footprint, investing $165 billion in new plants and research facilities in the coming year, only one-third of its most advanced chipmaking will take place in the US, the company said in an April call with investors. Still, Bank of America's Vivek Arya said TSMC's US expansion \"blunts Intel's advantage to some extent.\" For Intel, it all comes down to proving 18A can succeed. We'll find out later this year.

It's been a difficult several weeks for the health care giant. Last month, the shares plummeted plummeted 22% in a day when the companylowered its full-year profit forecast, while on Tuesday this week the stock dropped 18% onnews that CEO Andrew Witty was stepping down. UnitedHealth shares were up 6% recently at around $290, leading S&P 500 advancers on Friday. Even with today's gains, the stock has lost more than half its value over the past month as a surge in medical costs compounds other challenges facing the company, including a broader public backlash against the health insurance industry. Below, we breakdown thetechnicalson UnitedHealth\u2019sweekly chartand point out major price levels to watch out for. After staging a decisive close below the 50- and200-day moving averagesin mid-April, UnitedHealth shares have traded sharply lower in a move that has thrust therelative strength index (RSI)intooversoldterritory. Moreover, the stock\u2019s significant drop this week has occurred on the highest weeklytrading volumesince April 1998, signaling selling conviction by larger market participants, such asinstitutional investorsand pension funds. Let\u2019s point out two majorsupport levelsthat may act as a trading floor amid the possibility for further declines and also identify crucial overhead areas to track during recovery efforts in the stock. The first lower level to watch lies at $249. This area will likely attract significant attention near this week\u2019s low, which also closely aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart between January 2018 and April 2020. Selling below this level opens the door for a retest of lower support around $212. Investors may seekbuy-and-holdopportunities in this region near ahorizontal linethat roughly connects multiple troughs on the chart from March 2018 to the March 2020 pandemic low. During recovery efforts, investors should initially track the $325 area. The shares may run into overheadresistanceat this level near the August 2020peakand February 2021 trough. Finally, thebulls\u2019 ability to reclaim this crucial level could see UnitedHealth shares climb toward $365.

        "content": "Retirement may be a time to relax and enjoy life without job commitments. However, it's not the time to put your investments on auto-pilot. You'll want to stay on top of your investment strategy to ensure you don't run out of money in retirement. The first thing you'll need to consider are yourinvestmentgoals in retirement. Since you won't be working, you'll need a plan for how you'll cover your essential and discretionary expenses. You'll also want to prevent your money from running out. For most retirees, that means continuing to invest in a way that provides income and keeps their wealth growing\u2014while preserving their capital. Another goal should be to define the risk you can tolerate in your quest to increase the value of your account(s). Less aggressive investing usually means less risk of losing money, but a lower return. Your risk tolerance in retirement can help you determine the right asset allocation for your portfolio. \"In retirement, your money needs to do three things: generate income to cover living expenses now that paychecks have stopped, preserve capital because your\u00a0hard-earned\u00a0nest egg must last for decades, and managerisk,\" says Alvin Carlos. a financial planner and managing partner atDistrict Capital Management. \"You don't want to be in a situation where you are forced\u00a0to sell at a loss during a stock market downturn.\" As noted, keeping your money investedthroughout your retirementyears can generate income that you'll need and increase the value of your savings. \"Staying invested helps your money keep working for you. A good portfolio provides income through dividends and interest, while also offering growth to fight inflation and extend the life of your savings,\" Carlos advises. \"Retirement can last 30+ years.\" Having an asset allocation of stocks and bonds is a good way to structure yourretirement portfolio. \"It\u2019s really important to remain invested in the market during retirement, having a balance of both stocks and bonds,\" says Carla Adams, acertified financial plannerand founder ofAmetrine Wealth. \"Keeping your portfolio in all cash and/or bonds throughout retirement will cause you to lose purchasing power over time due to inflation. You need your portfolio to continue to grow to provide a steady, inflation-adjusted cash flow stream in retirement.\u00a0I view stocks as providing growth in the portfolio and bonds as providing stability in the portfolio.\" Passive investing is usually a good strategy at this stage of life. In contrast, actively trading stocks may involve too much market volatility and thus be too risky for people who don't have the time horizon to recover from losses. \"Passive investing\u00a0involves the use of\u00a0low-costindex funds. It is usually the best fit for retirees. It\u2019s simple, cost-effective, and reduces the risk of emotional decisions,\" Carlos says. \"Active trading\u00a0involves constantly buying and selling individual stocks or funds. It\u2019s time-consuming, stressful, and often leads\u00a0to underperformance.\" In addition, at least once a year, retirees should take the time torebalancetheir investment portfolios (or to make sure that an account representative handles it for them). \"Rebalancing is like a tune-up for your portfolio. It\u00a0keeps your investments aligned with your goals.\u00a0In a standard rebalance, you sell investments that have risen in value and buy ones that are underperforming,\" Carlos says. \"It can be counterintuitive, but it works. It prevents your portfolio from deviating too far from your original target.\" In other words, adjust the securities in your portfolio to the right value mix of equities andfixed-incomesecurities so that they continue to meet your investment goals of appropriate risk, income generation, preservation of capital, and growing account value. If necessary, don't hesitate to get help with your rebalancing from a financial advisor. Active tradingin retirement may keep you in the market, but it comes with risks, including choosing the wrong stocks and losing money. \"If you bet too much on one investment and it doesn't work out, you can experience a massive loss in your nest egg,\" Carlos says. \"Losses in retirement are harder to recover from, especially if you\u2019re regularly withdrawing money.\" To guard against these kinds of losses and their consequences, if you must trade actively, do so with a limited amount of your money. \"Active trading may appeal to engaged retirees but introduces volatility and requires more oversight,\" says Daniel Milks, a certified financial planner and founder ofFiduciary Organization. \"It\u2019s usually best kept to a small portion of the portfolio, if at all.\" Taxes can diminish the money available to you in retirement. So, if you decide that active trading is for you, you'll want to be aware of taxes. \"Frequent trading in taxable accounts may triggershort-term capital gains, taxed at your regular income rate,\" Carlos advises. \"That\u2019s why we loveRoth IRAs:\u00a0no taxes on dividends, no capital gains taxes. Your money grows tax-free in a Roth.\u00a0They\u2019re a powerful tool in retirement planning.\" If you have a Roth IRA, consider using it for trading purposes (orconvertinganother retirement account to a Roth if you don't, just for the overall tax benefits). But there are taxes to worry about with other types of retirement accounts. As you reach your 70s, you'll facerequired minimum distributionsfrom either atraditional IRAor 401(k), or both, and you'll pay taxes on each withdrawal. \"The one thing you will need to understand is traditional IRAs and 401(k)s will eventually be subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs).\u00a0RMDs currently start at 73, but for those born in 1960 or later RMDs will start at 75,\"says Mike Hunsberger, a certified financial planner and owner ofNext Mission Financial Planning. Tapping out these accounts early in your retirement years is one way to avoid RMDs in your 70s and the taxes that come with them. But no matter when you withdraw these retirement account funds, you'll owe taxes on them. So, timing withdrawals and deciding which accounts to take them from can be important. \"Managing withdrawals orRoth conversionsearly in retirement can be a great way to avoid having to take increasing annual withdrawals from your traditional accounts that could drive large tax bills later in life,\" Hunsberger says. The other thing to bear in mind is that withdrawals may add to your annual income, potentially pushing you into a higher tax bracket. That can have an impact on taxes that you may owe on yourSocial Security benefits. Even a portfolio with the right mix of securities for more conservative risk profiles can lose money. So when planning your withdrawals, another option is to take small amounts in early years so that if the markets tank, you'll have more money in your account (and more time) with which to recover your account value. Staying invested in the stock market throughout your retirement years is a must for most retirees. Doing so can help you guard against the negative effects of inflation, generate income, increase the value of your investment accounts, and preserve capital. What should you invest in? Consider a mix of stocks and bonds that matches your tolerance for risk. Low-cost index funds andETFscan offer a convenient, hands-off investing strategy and asset allocation solution. In addition, maintain a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy and keep your investments aligned with your retirement goals by rebalancing them at least once a year.",

        "content": "Ifretirement feels out of reachfor you, you're not alone. Recent surveys show that 68% of Americans aren't sure they'll ever be able to retire, and 79% of Americans say the country is facing aretirement crisis.A majority of Americans saytoday\u2019s financial environment makes long-term planning feel out of reach, as economic uncertainty reigns. Unfortunately, these fears reflect reality. Nearly 27% of people ages 65 to 74 were still in the workforce in 2023, up from 21.4% in 2003.That participation rate is expected to grow to 30.4% by 2033. In fact, people ages 75 and older are thefastest-growing age groupin the workforce, more than quadrupling in size since 1964, according to Pew Research Center. But if you want to retire, joining that cohort doesn't have to be your fate. Below, we take you through four effective strategies to boost yourretirement readiness. \"Most folks underestimate how long they'll live and how much income they'll need in those later years,\" saidDouglas A. Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York and a member ofInvestopedia's advisor council. \"Health care costs, long-term care, and even just rising rent or property taxes can blow a hole in a plan. Add insequence-of-returns risk(if the market tanks just as you're pulling money out), and suddenly what looked comfortable on paper feels precarious.\" Before settling on aretirement strategy, you'll want to honestly assess where you stand now. Calculate the percentage of your income you're putting toward your retirement and determine how much income you may need to replace in retirement. Experts typically recommend aiming to replace between 70% and 90% of your pre-retirement income. Useretirement calculatorsto gauge how prepared you are. \"I always start with azero-based budget: Every dollar of income gets assigned a job, whether it's groceries, mortgage, or retirement,\" Boneparth said. \"That transparent plan helps clients see where they can trim 'fun money' without feeling deprived, so they can redirect those savings into a401(k)or IRA.\" Unlike traditional budgeting that starts with previous spending patterns, zero-based budgeting begins each month from scratch. This forces you to intentionally allocate every dollar of income to specific categories\u2014including retirement savings\u2014before it's spent elsewhere. Many people miss chances to take full advantage of tax-advantaged plans like 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Health-savings accounts (HSAs) offer a \"triple tax break,\" Boneparth said. Contributions are pre-tax, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses remain untaxed\u2014and once you hit 65, you can use HSA dollars for non-medical expenses penalty-free, he said. He also recommends consideringconverting traditional IRAs to Roth IRAsin low-income years. \"Converting some pre-tax balance to a Roth when taxable income dips can reduce futureRMD[required minimum distribution] headaches,\" he said. If you're 50 or older, consider taking advantage ofcatch-up contributions, which enable you to make additional contributions beyond the standard annual limits. \"First, shore up your 'safety bucket.' Make sure you've got two to five years of living expenses in cash or short-duration bonds, so you don't have to sell stocks at a loss,\" Boneparth said. He adds that \"bucket or glide-path approaches\" are valuable because \"automating a shifting allocation over time helps clients stay invested through volatility without the urge to pull out at the wrong moment.\" Abucket strategydivides your investments into different time-based segments\u2014immediate needs (cash), medium-term goals (bonds), and long-term growth (stocks). This approach provides some comfort during market downturns since you know your immediate expenses are covered, allowing your longer-term investments time to recover.Glide-path strategiesautomatically adjust your asset allocation as you age, gradually becoming moreconservativewhile maintaining the potential for growth. Even a small increase in your retirement contribution rate\u2014just 1% to 2% annually\u2014can add more than tens of thousands to your retirement nest egg over time, thanks to the power ofcompoundgrowth. If you are in a position where you have topostpone retirement, there is a silver lining. Delaying taking yourSocial Security benefits, if you can, means higher payments when you do elect to begin taking them. \"Even a few years' delay can bump your benefit by 8% per year, effectively a guaranteed 'investment' with inflation protection,\" Boneparth said. Taking control of yourretirement planningisn't just about financial security\u2014it's also about having some peace of mind in uncertain times. These four strategies can help you build both financial resilience and the confidence that your retirement remains achievable, even when the economic landscape makes that seem further off than before.",

Snipe is the Principal of Odyssey Capital Advisors. Still a Top Name in AI During NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)'s last earnings call, the company noted that it expected to benefit from \"about $1 trillion of (capital spending) over the next few years on AI factories,\" the investor noted. As a result, Snipe believes that the company continues to be poised to benefit tremendously from the AI Revolution. \"A Boost\" From the Saudis Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund recently agreed to utilize hundreds of thousands of NVDA's AI chips in the data centers that it's building. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has gotten \"a boost\" from the news, said Snipe, adding that the deal \"is going to be powerful\" for the tech giant. Wapner Provides Background Information NVDA stock has climbed \"above its 200 day moving average for the first time since February (and) its market cap is back above $3 trillion, \"noted CNBC anchor Scott Wapner during the same segment in which Snipe spoke. \"It's really been a remarkable comeback,\" Wapner said.

It's the second major move this week involving Middle Eastern buyers, following Nvidia's agreement to supply chips to Saudi Arabia. Pair that with a temporary easing of U.S.-China tariffs, and you've got a recipe that could push Nvidia's international expansion into overdrive. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Nvidia stock has surged 15.5% in the past five days, sending its valuation back above the $3.2 trillion mark. That kind of run doesn't happen in a vacuum. It's powered by a bigger narrative: the global race for AI dominanceand Nvidia sitting front and center. The UAE and Saudi Arabia aren't just any customers. They've got the capital, the ambition, and now, potentially, the chips to build next-gen AI ecosystems. If these deals materialize, they could mark the start of a new era of U.S.-Middle East tech cooperationwith Nvidia as the core supplier. The broader market was flat by comparison.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Wistron CEO Jeff Lin confirmed that Dallas and Houston facilitiespart of more than one million square feet of commissioned manufacturing space across Texas and Arizonawill follow the customer's lead and start producing Nvidia Blackwell-based AI servers next year. The Dallas plant will focus on server assembly, while Houston, in partnership with Foxconn, will handle testing and module integration for both chips and systems. Wistron is also in talks to use its U.S. facilities for other hyperscale clients, though details remain under wraps. This announcement comes a month after Nvidia disclosed its strategy to manufacture and test AI chips domestically, citing supply-chain resilience amid export curbs and geopolitical friction. By localizing server production in the U.S., Nvidia aims to shore up capacity for its rapidly growing data-center business, which reported 50% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 and now represents over 60% of total sales. Wistron's timeline dovetails with Nvidia's goal to double AI-server shipments by FY27, as enterprises accelerate adoption of generative AI workloads. Why It Matters: U.S. onshore production of AI servers could alleviate logistics bottlenecks, secure supply chains against export restrictions, and underpin sustained data-center expansion. Nvidia has seen a strong rebound in recent weeks, with its stock jumping 15.1% over the past week and 20.4% in the past monthdoubling the S&P 500's gains in both timeframes. However, the six-month picture still shows a 4.84% decline, suggesting prior weakness or consolidation before this recent surge.

        "content": "Market Domination hostJosh Liptonand Bullseye American Ingenuity Fund portfolio manager Adam Johnson go over some of the top trending stories of the day. Nvidia (NVDA) is in focus followingreports from the Financial Timesthat the American chipmaker is reportedly building a research and development center in China. Oil prices (CL=F,BZ=F) rise as President Trump says the US is closer to a nuclear deal with Iran. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. All right, let's take checking on some few trending tickers here. That's sponsored by tasty trade. We're going to take a look at shares of Nvidia today, as well as some moves in the oil market. First up, Nvidia reportedly building a research and development center in China. This is according to the FT, the Financial Times. So, that made some headlines here, but let's broaden this out a little bit because Nvidia is on a roll here. I mean, the recent moves here, uh, yes, we know deals announced in Saudi Arabia, UAE. I mean, I think also, you look at those earnings season, those big tech giants. There was a lot of worries about the AI boom, would these customers keep spending? Alphabet reiterates CAPEX, Microsoft reiterates, meta raises. All good news for Jensen Huang. Sure is. Well, at one point, uh, that April low that we were just talking about that was so sobering, at one point, Nvidia was cheaper than the S&P 500, right? The S&P 500 at the low was trading at about 19 times. Well, Nvidia was trading because it went down, you know, in the 80s. It was trading at 18 times. I mean, imagine Nvidia, the darling of the AI thing with uh, 50, 60, 70% earnings growth trading at 18 times cheaper than the S&P 500. I mean, it got so crazy. And it wasn't just Nvidia, it was Celestica, it was Marvell, it was Semimicro Computer, and um, they have all come roaring back, Josh. It sounds like Jensen Huang is also very much on President Trump's good side. He was at CFRA, uh, their team of analysts. They said this week, our outlook on Nvidia has considerably improved. They told their clients in recent weeks. They talked about favorable policy shifts, more lenient China tariffs, scrapping of the AI diffusion rule. They didn't mention uncertainty remains around the 232 semiconductor investigation. Earnings scheduled for May 20th. Do you like this name? You better believe it. Yeah, I bought this, uh, stock for my clients back when it was in the teens, a teenager, as they like to say on Wall Street, and now as, as we were just showing, it was what? 1, 130, 135, etcetera, and I think going on to new highs. I think you have to own Nvidia. I think of it is core ingenuity, right? Um, I run the American ingenuity fund, so I've got a core group of names that I almost never sell. Uh, the MAG7. I don't own all the MAG7, but I own the obvious ones, Google, Amazon, Apple, etcetera, Meta. Uh, and I think you have to put Nvidia into that core ingenuity. I would also tell you put um, uh, uh, salesforce.com into, uh, that core ingenuity and Palo Alto software. Why do you like Benioff's company? Because it's the biggest and best and the first, uh, in customer relationship management. The, the software platforms that help companies mine data to find more sales so they can grow their business. So, it's a facilitator growth. And then Palo Alto Networks largest cybersecurity firm in the world. And um, I mean, you could argue as to whether they're the best, but they are the largest, and they really wrote the book on so much as I love owning best in breed companies. So, if you look at those names at Nvidia and then MAG7 to me, that's core ingenuity. I think you have to own those names. In fact, about a third of the portfolio, and I own 41 companies in the portfolio, but a third of the portfolio is uh, is, is accounted for by those core ingenuity names. All right, let's, let's switch gears here. We'll talk about oil prices as well. Higher today, hope growing for a US Iran nuclear deal, maybe that lift sanctions, potentially boost global supply. There was different headlines I saw today on this one. I did see reports that Iran's foreign minister actually downplayed pros prospects for a breakthrough in nuclear talks with the Trump administration, saying no formal proposal had been received. This is per Bloomberg. Of course, when prices, we know, had come under some pressure when President Trump seems to suggest maybe there, we were closer to a potential deal, but give me, give me your take, Adam. Well, this is going to be a very drawn out and complicated, um, negotiation over time. Remember, it's not just about the US and Iran or just about Iran's nuclear capabilities. Uh, it's also about the, the age-old, and I mean centuries-old, um, uh, wrestling match between uh, Sunnis and Shiites. And um, Iran is traditionally Shiite, and Saudi Arabia is Sunni. That's one reason why those two countries have have been uh, uh, well, I don't want to say enemies, but uh, certainly uh, at odds with one another for uh, for so long. And so there're just a lot of complicated issues that you and I, I mean, we sit here in New York, and I'm a Wall Street guy, and you're a half Wall Street, half media guy, and we could sort of, you know, contemplate what, what it means, um, you know, Sunni versus Shiite, but we'll never really know. We'll never really understand it or appreciate the depth of all of that. And that's why all this is going to take a long time. Add to that the fact that the US is trying to get Saudi Arabia to participate in the Abraham Accords, which is basically a platform that allows, or it tries to pave the way for Israel and uh, various Arab nations to come together on more favorable terms. I mean, this is complex stuff. Let me ask you to bring it back though to you as a Wall Street guy. Are there energy names where you say, yes, I, I want to own this for my clients? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you, you, you, you raise, what you're getting at is a very interesting point. And and that is, I think that part of the reason the Trump administration is reaching out so hard to both actually Russia and Iran is that if we can form, if there's truce between Russia and Ukraine, and and if there is, uh, no more nukes, uh, uh, in Iran, you could effectively bring embargoed barrels of oil back on the market, millions of barrels. And guess what, as the price of oil goes down, inflation goes down.",

That stake, included in a 13G filing on Thursday, compared with a 5.2% figure in CoreWeave\u2019s prospectus. The amount shows how Nvidia supported CoreWeave\u2019s late-March initial public offering, acquiring about 6 million shares to add to its existing holding. A representative for Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia declined to comment. Nvidia, which has fast become one of the most influential companies in Silicon Valley, anchored the IPO with an order of about $250 million, a person with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News at the time. That was roughly 17% of the deal, before the over-allotment option. Like Nvidia, CoreWeave has benefited from the surge in spending on artificial intelligence computing. The Livingston, New Jersey-based company is accelerating capital spending to meet demand for its services, but that\u2019s increasing its red ink. Losses widened to $1.49 a share last quarter, compared with 62 cents a year earlier. On Friday, the shares jumped to $80.30. That\u2019s more than double the $40 IPO price from March. In addition to backing CoreWeave, Nvidia provides the crucial components that let the data center provider handle AI traffic. Access to this limited supply of Nvidia chips means that CoreWeave is able to offer the most advanced capabilities for the creation and running of AI services. \u2014With assistance from Zachary Fleming and Ian King.

        "header": "Did Elon Musk Just Give Nvidia Investors 40 Billion Reasons to Cheer?",
        "content": "When it comes to training generative AI models,Nvidia's(NVDA0.28%)graphics processing units (GPUs) are hailed as the gold standard among industry experts. That's not exactly a novel conclusion considering the semiconductor powerhouse has amassed an estimated 90% or more of the GPU market. The more subtle idea here is how exactly Nvidia built such a gigantic lead over the competition. While it does not explicitly specify which companies buy its GPUs, it's widely speculated across Wall Street that cloud hyperscalersMicrosoft,Alphabet, andAmazon, as well asMeta Platformsare among Nvidia's largest customers. Considering that these players are forecasting well in excess of $300 billion on AI infrastructure spending just this year, I wouldn't be shocked at all if these \"Magnificent Seven\" members are repeat customers of Nvidia. But beyond the typical mega-cap AI names is another company quickly emerging as a top client. Let's explore how Elon Musk's new start-up,xAI, is deploying Nvidia's hardware and assess just how much it could be spending on the industry's best chip architecture. Musk's xAI is a start-up building a large language model (LLM) called Grok, which is meant to compete with the likes of other popular LLMs such as ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI. For the last year, xAI's primary focus was building a supercomputer to train its AI applications. The initial stage of development for the supercomputer, called Colossus, used100,000 Nvidia GPUs. Shortly thereafter,Musk and his team scaled up its GPU cluster to 200,000 chips. Image source: Getty Images. A couple of months ago, Musk sat down with a team of developers and talked shop about how Grok is trained and what's next for xAI. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he doubled down on securing more GPUs. At the time, he implied that the next training cluster would be five times larger than the current infrastructure. In other words, Colossus 2 would need 1 million chips (five times the 200,000 referenced above). He estimated the total cost for this project would fall between $25 billion and $30 billion. However, according to a more recent report fromBeth Kindig, the CEO and lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, Colossus 2 may cost closer to $40 billion. ConsideringNvidia's chips sell for between $30,000 and $40,000 on average, it's not unreasonable to think Musk's next big project could cost tens of billions of dollars -- as Kindig implies. One of the main concerns surrounding an investment in Nvidia right now is the rise of custom silicon. Even though the hyperscalers all buy its GPUs today, each is also working on developing its own chips in-house. When you layer on top thatAdvanced Micro Devices(or AMD) is quickly gaining steam in the data center realm, there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about Nvidia's current growth trajectory.  NVDA Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts; EPS = earnings per share. Check out Wall Street's revenue and earnings forecasts above for Nvidia over the next couple of years. While the company's growth may begin to show some signs of deceleration, I'd say this is actually quite normal for a mature business, especially in the face of rising competition. The bigger idea underscored by the financial profile above is that industry analysts are still forecasting growth for Nvidia over the next couple of years. In addition, if xAI does spend near the higher end of the estimated total cost I referenced above, this also showcases that the chipmaker is able to maintain some relativepricing powerdespite the intensifying competitive landscape. I think these trends suggest that even if the cloud hyperscalers begin to diversify away from Nvidia, and AMD maintains its current momentum, it is still in a unique position, with emerging customers such as xAI willing to absorb demand from traditional customers. Right now, Nvidia stock is trading near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple in a year. I think concerns around tariffs, export controls in China, and rising competition have all made for a short-term souring on the semiconductor leader. But if the forecasts above and Musk's aggressive buying of Nvidia GPUs say anything, it's that the company shouldn't have much trouble fulfilling demand. I think now is a great opportunity to take advantage of Nvidia's stock price action and prepare to hold for the long run.",

        "content": "If you looked at a list ofthe world's 20 most valuable companiesfrom a decade ago, you'd notice several familiar names:Apple,Microsoft, Google (nowAlphabet), andBerkshire Hathawayall made the list back then. But as much as things have stayed the same, there's also been considerable turnover and movement in the ranks.Wells FargoandNovartishave fallen way down the list over the last decade.Nvidiahad only recently climbed out of the mid-cap stock range in 2015, but soared into the top 10 in 2021. All this is to say a lot can change in 10 years. And I believe one \"Magnificent Seven\" company that's bringing up the rear in that group today is also the one that's best positioned to become the world's most valuable company within the next decade. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has been a huge beneficiary over the last few years from the massiveartificial intelligence(AI) infrastructure spending by the hyperscalers: Microsoft, Alphabet,Amazon,andMeta Platforms(META-0.59%). Its cutting-edge GPUs (graphics processing units) are unparalleled when it comes to traininglarge language modelsin the most cost-efficient manner. As a result, Nvidia is selling its chips just as fast as they're manufactured (indeed, faster -- its order backlog for Blackwell GPUs is now around a year), leading to strong margin expansion and earnings growth. But the long-term winners of any technological revolution tend to be those that are best able to use the technology. That is, the second-order effects of new technology are even bigger than the first-order effects. To use the old gold rush analogy, it's not the pick and shovel makers, but the prospectors with the best systems for utilizing those picks and shovels who end up wealthiest of all. With that in mind, Meta looks best positioned to take advantage of everything large language models and generative AI can do. That's why I expect it to be the biggest second-order winner from artificial intelligence, and why I anticipate that tailwind to propel it to the status of most valuable company in the world. It'll just take some time for the company (and investors) to fully realize the impact of AI on its business. Meta has been a big investor in artificial intelligence for a long time. It's fundamental to its core business, which is simply putting content in front of users. Whether that content was originally generated by a friend, a stranger, or a business, Meta has become very good at surfacing the right content to users in order to maximize its revenue through a combination of increased engagement and increased ad value. And its AI algorithms are a key reason why it's been able to successfully do that. Generative AI powered by large language models has the potential to unlock a ton of value for Meta's business. Here are four ways that could happen over the next decade. Meta used to require advertisers to select a target audience for their ad creatives. While sophisticated marketers may be able to eke out a few extra basis points of performance from custom ad targeting, Meta's AI now does a great job of finding those target audiences to optimize for conversions (or any other campaign objective). As a result, there's more emphasis on the ad creative. Developing a good ad creative that resonates with the target audience performs exceptionally well on Meta's platform. But that requires a lot of testing and iteration, not to mention time. Generative AI can assist with developing dozens of ad creatives with hyper-targeted copy, images, and videos. That in turn improves conversions faster than any improvements Meta can make to its targeting algorithm. Meta also has more potential to benefit from generative AI than other digital advertising channels like Google or Amazon. That's because marketers use Meta to find their target audiences, while ad impressions on Google or Amazon already have viewers with high intent. If someone searches for \"shovel\" on Amazon, it doesn't take complicated software to figure out that you'll probably do well to show them ads for shovels. Meta stands to benefit from building several different types ofAI agentsfor its customers. During Meta's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg described his vision for AI in advertising: \"Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve ... and how much they're willing to pay for each result, and then we just do the rest,\" he said. What he's describing is an AI agent that will make some ad creatives, test them using Meta's automated targeting, iterate on those creatives, and ultimately deliver the desired result. The advertisers' savings in time and resources should translate into higher ad prices for Meta. Meta could also benefit fromdeveloping customer service agents and sales agents for its messaging apps. That could enable businesses to deepen their relationships with prospective and existing customers without spending significantly on overhead. More importantly, that software scales quickly and easily. That should enable Meta to massively expand its click-to-message business, which was a $10 billion annual business as of early 2023. One analyst thinks chat agents could be a $100 billion business for Meta. Generative AI is helping marketers make more engaging ads. Eventually, Meta could use AI to generate bespoke content for each user. Zuckerberg said as much on the company's first-quarter earnings call. \"AI is also enabling the creation of better content,\" he said. While some of that content will be in collaboration with human creators, he also sees \"AI generating content directly for people that is personalized for them.\" If Meta is able to create an endless feed of hyper-specific personalized content, it could result in one of the most engaging platforms ever. On top of that, it could make advertising even more effective, as AI-generated ad campaigns become just as personalized and even indistinguishable from entertainment in Meta's feeds. Meta was an early mover when it came to virtual reality (VR) andaugmented reality(AR). One of the biggest challenges it has faced is that there's not a large ecosystem of content, nor many compelling use cases yet for a headset compared to smartphones and other computer formats. However, generative AI could help solve that. The company has already seen success with integrating Meta AI into a pair of glasses, which gives the AI the ability to take in visual data from the world as the user sees it. Augmented reality takes that one step further by enabling the AI to interact virtually with the world. That could lead to all sorts of interesting human-computer interactions, better user interfaces, and improved experiences. Just as Zuckerberg envisions AI generating unique content for users on Facebook and Instagram, it could also generate even more immersive and interactive content. That's the type of content that could push AR and VR headsets forward, and Meta is well positioned to own that format with its 10-year head start. There's a good reason Meta is willing to spend around $70 billion this year on capital expenditures, primarily going toward the advancement of its AI development. The potential payoff for the business is massive, likely more than any other company. So, while Nvidia is reaping the rewards in the short run, Meta stands to be the biggest long-term winner from AI, and I expect that will translate into the social media giant carrying a much bigger market cap a decade from now.",

        "content": "One of the emerging pockets that's piquing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm right now is quantum computing. While the technology is not widely used today, curious investors seem to have bought into the idea that quantum computing represents the next chapter in the AI narrative. Among notable players fueling the quantum computing landscape isIonQ(IONQ7.74%), which has witnessed a 275% rise in its share price over the last 12 months. I think that IonQ's rapid ascent echoes the rise ofPalantir Technologiesthroughout the AI frenzy. Could investing in IonQ today be like catching Palantir at the onset of the AI revolution? Read on to find out. The chart below illustrates IonQ's revenue growth trends over the last several years. I'll admit that the steeping slope of the revenue line is quite impressive. And considering the company has won over the likes ofNvidia,Microsoft,Amazon, andAlphabetas key customers and partners, IonQ's future looks pretty bright.  IONQ Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts Over the last 12 months, IonQ has only generated $43 million in sales. So even though the company's growth rate looks enormous, this percentage growth is going off a relatively small figure in the grand scheme of things. Nevertheless, IonQ's market cap currently hovers around $8 billion -- putting the company'sprice-to-sales(P/S) ratio right around 165. Considering IonQ is still burning cash and not generating meaningful revenue, it's hard to justify such a lofty valuation. Image source: Getty Images. One of the chief concerns surrounding an investment in Palantir is also that the company's valuation has become overextended. GivenPalantir's P/S multipleis among the highest across leading enterprise software businesses, I understand these concerns.  PLTR PS Ratiodata byYCharts The caveat I would make is twofold. First, Palantir is already proving that its software platforms are an integral component to AI roadmaps across the public and private sectors. This is underscored by the company's consistent ability to command healthy revenue accelerationandpositive earnings. Second, I would not apply too much weight to IonQ's relationships with big tech. Nvidia already has its own quantum computing platform, calledCUDA-Q. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon have each built their own quantum chips. Given each of these \"Magnificent Seven\" members are already dominating the AI space and innovating at a rapid pace to enter new markets such as quantum computing, I'm hard-pressed to see how IonQ will compete in the long run -- especially as long as the company remains unprofitable. At the end of the day,Palantir's future prospectsare somewhat predictable given the current trajectory and robust outlook from management suggest that AI-powered software will remain in demand for years to come. For these reasons, some investors can justify Palantir's premium valuation. Given the nascency of quantum computing and the competition IonQ faces, I do not think the same can be said for the company. While following a hot stock can be entertaining and tempting, oftentimes it's also pretty dangerous. Ultimately, I think IonQ has already experienced its \"Palantir moment\" and I see pressure on the stock as the more likely outcome going forward. I'd pass on investing in IonQ and opt for more established opportunities in the AI sector across megacap tech.",

Individual investors have been on an emotional rollercoaster this year amid the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive and sometimes-uncleartariff policiesand economic agenda. Recent news that the U.S. and China agreed to a90-day negotiation periodin their tariff war and other developments have helped spur a rally across the capital markets, and the S&P 500 has recovered all of its losses since Trump's \"Liberation Day\" on April 2. While that has quelled some of the anxiety among individual investors, 55% of respondents to our latest Investor Sentiment Survey say they are still \u201csomewhat concerned\u201d about recent market events. That\u2019s a 6-percentage-point drop from a month ago, but their level of concern is stillnear four-year highs. Twenty-eight percent of respondents say they are \"extremely worried,\u201d while 18% say they are not worried at all. While 42% of respondents said they are making safer investments into securities likemoney market funds, high-yield savings, index funds, and diversifiedexchange-traded funds (ETFs), nearly half, or 47%, said they haven't made changes to their investments or their allocations. Eleven percent indicated that they have made riskier investments in products like inverse ETFs and single stocks of companies that experiencedheavy sell-offs. According to Vanda Research, the single stocks that experienced the most buying activity by retail investors outside of their 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts include Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir Technologies (PLTR), Ford Motor (F), and Robinhood Markets (HOOD). Tariffs and reciprocal tariffs top our readers list of concerns, just as they have for the past several months, as does the threat of arecession. Nearly three-fourths of respondents, or 72%, say there's at least a 50/50 chance of a recession over the next 12 months, and about one-third say they believe one is likely or very likely. U.S. relations with China, which are centered on tariffs, are also high on the list of investor worries, followed by inflation and stagflation. The recent volatility in the stock market continues to weigh on investors\u2019 faith in thecapital markets, according to the survey. Forty-seven percent of respondents indicated that they trust the markets less since the Trump administration took office. Just 16% said they trust them more, while nearly one-third said the new administration has had no effect on their trust. Investors have been curbing their expectations for stock market returns since the beginning of the year, according to our surveys, but the recent recovery in the market has added a few sprinkles of optimism. One in four expect the stock market to return at least 5% over the next six months, a 12-percentage-point increase from mid-April. At the same time, one in four expect losses of at least 5% over the next six months, although that has declined 17 percentage points from last month. Most respondents, or 61%, still believe that U.S. equities will deliver the best returns over the next decade compared with other majorasset classeslike bonds, gold, and bitcoin. Our readers remain very committed and faithful to their favorite stocks, like Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN), as shown in the illustration below.

Here are the top stocks our readers said they would buy and hold for the next decade. Look familiar? Investopedia When readers were asked what one stock they would buy and hold today, the largest share of write-ins went toBerkshire Hathawayand Nvidia, followed by Microsoft and Amazon. In general, however, the survey showed much overlap between what stocks readers are already holding and what they would invest in long-term. Despite their faith in their favorite stocks, not all of our readers would choose to put an extra $10,000 into them today if they had it to invest. Safer investments like high yield savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts top the list of where they would put that discretionary capital to work, followed by ETFs or index funds, and then individual stocks.
