        "header": "What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI",
        "content": "This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.  To put this into perspective, thats:  * 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks * 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips * More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined** * Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7  As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?  First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.  DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it\u2019s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**  Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.  Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:  * 1U and 2U server chassis * Motherboards * Power supplies * GPU trays  Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That\u2019s low-margin business, because you\u2019re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:  * CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi) * Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.) * Network switches * Rack management software * Power distribution units (PDUs)  Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:  |Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)| |:-|:-| |Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration| |$5K\u2013$15K ASP/server|$250K\u2013$2M ASP per rack| |6\u201310% gross margin|**15\u201325%+ gross margin**| |Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|  Now lets go more in depth:  **1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**  * Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K\u2013$50K** each. * Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64\u201396 GPUs) sell for **$2\u20135 million per rack**. * Even if gross margins stay in the 8\u201310% range, **gross profit per rack is 40\u00d7\u201380\u00d7 higher** than per-server sales.  Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.  **2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**  With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it\u2019s delivering:  * 8\u201312 liquid-cooled GPU servers * 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month * Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units) * Power delivery + networking * Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration * Software/BIOS optimization  All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:  1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components 2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services 3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles  **3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**  SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3\u20134 weeks**, while others take 8\u201312 weeks+ with multiple vendors.  For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.  For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:  * Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs * 3\u20134 month delay in deploying AI training models * Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers  Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:  |**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**SMCI**|**\\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3\u20134 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready| |**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\\~6\u201310 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released| |**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\\~8\u201312 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients| |**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|  This \u201ctime-value\u201d premium enhances margin per contract.  **4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**  Clients benefit from:  * 30\u201350%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level) * Higher rack density \u2192 fewer racks \u2192 less real estate * Reduced HVAC burden \u2192 capex + opex savings  Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80\u2013100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack \u2014 which:  * Makes SMCI\u2019s per-rack offering more economically valuable * Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive  Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin  **5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**  SMCI is building out:  * A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia * A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly  This allows SMCI to:  * Mass produce racks with minimal retooling * Reduce per-rack cost at high volume * Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity  Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit \u2192 rising margin  Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:  |**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**| |:-|:-| |High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms| |Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit| |Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs| |Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO \u2192 preserves SMCI pricing power| |Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|  So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.  Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal  After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:  |Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40| |2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00| |5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40| |10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80| |25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80| |50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00| |100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|  As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.  **How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**  This wasn\u2019t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:  **1. Historical Precedent (30%)**  * No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor. * Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build \u2014 suggesting up to 25% is plausible.  **2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**  * Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2\u20134 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging. * Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.  **3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**  * SMCI can output \\~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**. * To hit 50\u2013100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they\u2019d need to commit 6\u201312 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.  **4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**  * SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10\u201325% is well within reach. * But **50\u2013100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.  **5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**  * SMCI\u2019s lead time (3\u20134 weeks vs. 8\u201312 weeks) is a massive advantage. * For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** \u2014 but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.  I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:  [Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  [Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)    All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.  Last but not least, Cramer is [\u201cSick of\u201d](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI     TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.  Position: 15 $91c 1/16 https://ibb.co/b5J9VNmY",

        "content": "CoreWeave (CRWV) shares soared last week after the AI cloud provider posted a surge in quarterly revenue and disclosed that Nvidia (NVDA) has a higher stake in the company than investors had anticipated. CoreWeave, which went public in late March, reported Wednesday thatfirst-quarter revenue grew over 400% year-over-yearand said via a regulatory filing on Thursday that major partner Nvidia holds a 7% stake in the company, up from its pre-initial public offeringholdings of roughly 5%. The company also said last week that it had agreed to a four-year deal withChatGPTmaker OpenAI worth up to $4 billion, adding to a nearly $12 billion commitment announced in March. CoreWeave shares have more than doubled from their$40 IPO price, boosted by last week\u2019s news and investor appetite for up-and-cominggenerative AIplays that are scaling to meet the technology\u2019s widespread demand. The stock gained 56% last week alone, closing Friday's session at $80.30. Below, we break down thetechnicalson CoreWeave\u2019s hourly chart and point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching out for. CoreWeave shares forged acup and handle patternon the chart between late April and early May before breaking out above the formation\u2019s top trendline last week. Importantly, the move higher has occurred on above-averagetrading volume, indicating conviction from larger market participants behind the buying. Moreover, therelative strength indexconfirms bullish price momentum with an elevated reading, though the indicator fell below theoverboughtthreshold on Friday, suggesting minorprofit-takingahead of the weekend. Let\u2019s applytechnical analysisto identify a potential upside price target to watch if CoreWeave shares continue to rally and also identify several keysupport levelsworth monitoring during pullbacks. Investors can project a potential upside price target by using themeasuring principle, a technique that analyzes priorprice actionto forecast future moves. When applying the tool to CoreWeave\u2019s chart, we calculate the percentage change of the cup and handle\u2019s \u201ccup\u201d and add it to the pattern\u2019s top trendline value. For example, we apply a 70% increase to $57, which projects a target of $96.90, about 20% above Friday\u2019s closing price. The first lower level on the chart to monitor sits around $73. Investors looking forretracemententry opportunities may place buylimit ordersin this location near Thursday\u2019s high. Finally, a deeper pullback in CoreWeave shares could see the price revisit key lower support around $57.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) announced Monday it will develop custom data center CPUs designed to link with Nvidia\u2019s AI chips, marking a renewed push into the server processor market. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI accelerator space, its chips require CPUs\u2014traditionally supplied by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Nvidia has also entered the CPU market with its Arm-based \"Grace\" chip. Now, Qualcomm is rejoining the race, leveraging Nvidia technology to improve communication between its CPUs and Nvidia GPUs. \u201cWith the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia\u2019s rack-scale architecture, we\u2019re advancing a shared vision of high-performance energy-efficient computing to the data center,\u201d Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said Monday. Qualcomm initially pursued an Arm-based server chip in the 2010s and tested it with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), but scaled back the effort amid legal pressures and cost cuts. The initiative was revived following Qualcomm\u2019s 2021 acquisition of a team of former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) chip engineers. Since then, the company has resumed discussions with Meta and signed a letter of understanding with Saudi AI firm Humain to co-develop a custom data center CPU. Qualcomm\u2019s push into data center CPUs gained momentum with its 2021 acquisition of Nuvia, a company that develops Arm-based processor designs and plays a central role in Qualcomm\u2019s renewed server chip ambitions. The data center CPU space is fiercely competitive, with major cloud providers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) already deploying their own custom-built processors, alongside established industry giants AMD and Intel. Qualcomm\u2019s expansion into this segment is part of a broader effort to reduce its reliance on smartphones, where it has long dominated with processors and modems. The company is promoting its chips as energy-efficient and capable of running AI workloads directly on devices, rather than offloading them to the cloud. This on-device approach could enable faster AI performance and improved privacy, as sensitive data remains local to the hardware.

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. In today's climate ofeconomic uncertainty, triggered by President Donald Trump's evolvingtariffpolicy, parking some cash in reserve feels prudent. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or shifting funds from more volatile investments, it's important to consider how much you can earn from different cash strategies. Fortunately, the options are excellent right now, as returns continue to be buoyed by theFederal Reserve'sbenchmark interest rateremaining high. Not only that, but it appears likely the central bank will keep its federal funds rate where it is for two more meetings. According to theCME Group's FedWatch Tool, financial markets are currently pricing in almost 70% odds that the first 2025 rate cut won't come before the Fed's Sept. 17 rate announcement. That would be good news for savers, as the rates that banks, credit unions, and brokerages are willing to pay on your savings are directly impacted by thefederal funds rate. Anytime the Fed cuts that benchmark rate, rates for savings, money market, and CD accounts fall as well. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, as of Friday's market close, and indicate the change from a week prior. The rates below are the top nationally available APYs from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. Note that savings and money market account rates are variable, meaning the bank is free to lower them at any time. In contrast, CD rates are locked and guaranteed for the certificate's full term. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed but can change at any time. Treasury securities pay their rate through maturity and can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect, or can be bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage. I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirect and can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account\u2014sometimes called ahigh-yield savings account\u2014that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives youmore than 15 options that pay 4.35% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type\u2014money market or savings\u2014pays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.40% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includesoptions paying up to 4.50% APY. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.94% to 4.21% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds \"swept\" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- or 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.95% to 4.92%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsdirectly fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect\u2014the U.S. Treasury\u2019s online platform for buying federal government securities\u2014has no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. Every six months you own the bond, your rate will change. I bond rates just went up on May 1, from 3.11% for bonds issued during the previous six months to 3.98% for new bonds purchased between May 1 and Oct. 31, 2025. ForexistingI bond holders, your next six-month rate will also increase\u2014by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe recent rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

Nvidia shares were down 2.5% in pre-market trading on Monday, though the stock has seen a stronger performance more recently and is up 29% over the past month. Last week, Huang said during an investment forum in Saudi Arabia \u2014 which was attended by US president Donald Trump and other Big Tech CEOs \u2014 that the chipmakerwill ship its semiconductors to Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence company Humainfor its massive data centre plans. Hong Kong-listed shares in Alibaba (9988.HK) fell 3% on Monday, following a report over the weekend that the Trump administration hadraised concerns about a potential dealbetween the Chinese tech giant and iPhone-maker Apple (AAPL). TheNew York Times reportedon Saturday that the White House and congressional officials have been scrutinising Apple's plan to strike a deal with Alibaba to make its AI available on iPhones in China.

The report further weighed on Alibaba shares, which dropped last week after the company's earnings missed estimates. Fourth-quarter revenue of 236.45 billion yuan was below analyst expectations of 237.24 billion yuan (\u00a324.57bn), according to a Reuters report. Adjusted earnings of 12.52 yuan per American Depositary Share also just missed estimates of 12.94 yuan. Shares in biotechnology company Novavax (NVAX) surged 17% in pre-market trading on Monday, after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its Covid-19 vaccine, albeit with certain conditions. In a letter issued on Friday, the FDA said that the vaccine was approved for people aged 65 and over, and those aged 12 and over if they had at least one underlying condition that put them at high risk of severe illness from Covid.

Ryanair posted revenue of \u20ac13.44bn (\u00a311.31bn), which was up 4% on the previous year, while profit after tax of \u20ac1.6bn was down 16%. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Companies often find some extraordinary language to avoid stating the bare facts. Ryanair says consumer spending pressure and a drop-off in online travel agent bookings \u2018necessitated repeated price stimulation\u2019. In plain English, it had to cut prices to get bums on seats. Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio \"Further headwinds for Ryanair are the problems at Boeing which are limiting its growth efforts and have forced consistent downgrades to its passenger growth targets,\" he said. \"The airline is confident it can catch up on this missed growth but, in the current environment, investors would be forgiven for exercising some healthy scepticism.\" However, Mould said that profit was towards the \"higher end of expectations and the company feels sufficiently confident about the outlook to unveil a substantial share buyback.\" On the London market, Diageo (DGE.L) shares were flat after the drinks maker said that it expected to take a hit of $150m (\u00a3112m) from tariffs. In its third quarter results, released on Monday, Diageo posted a 2.9% increase in net sales to $4.4bn and reiterated its guidance for the full-year. In addition, the company said it was launching a $500m cost savings programme over three years. \"Investors were braced for a bad quarter from Diageo yet the drinks giant has managed to pull a rabbit out of the hat,\" said AJ Bell's Mould. Read more:Stocks to watch this week: Palo Alto Networks, Analog Devices, Marks & Spencer, Greggs and easyJet \"Sales were driven by a mixture of volume and prices, with Diageo benefiting from wholesalers stocking up ahead of tariffs. That suggests the next quarter might not be as good if some of its sales have effectively been brought forward.\" Mould said that Diageo seemed \"remarkably calm about tariffs\", despite the guidance of a $150m impact. \"It\u2019s no surprise to see the announcement of a new cost-saving programme, and it\u2019s talking the market\u2019s language by chatting about cash flow targets,\" he added. \"These are the kind of things that excite investors and get them fired up, but there\u2019s a big difference between saying you\u2019ll do something and actually achieving it. \"Diageo has a big job to win back the market\u2019s favour after a difficult few years and it could be a long road to recovery.\" Assura (AGR.L) Baidu (9888.HK) Moody's Corporation (MCO) Big Yellow Group (BYG.L) Kainos (KNOS.L) Read more: Five 'buy' rated European travel stocks UK economy grows 0.7% in first quarter of the year Savers making costly 'bad decisions' around pensions as 15 million risk retirement poverty Download the Yahoo Finance app, available forAppleandAndroid.",

        "header": "Intel debuts AI GPUs for workstation system as it works to gain ground on Nvidia, AMD",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) is expanding its graphics chip offerings with the debut of its Arc Pro B50 and B60 series workstation cards. The options, starting at $299 and $500 and higher, respectively, are designed for customers who don't necessarily need or want to use cloud-based AI processors from the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG,GOOGL), or Microsoft (MSFT). Workstation systems provide strong security since data is processed on-site rather than being sent to the cloud. They're also generally more customizable and offer instant access to powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) without the potential for having to wait for availability via cloud services. Intel has been working on its Arc GPU platform for years. It currently offers its B-series chips for gamers, dubbed Battlemage, and an A-series range for workstations, though those cards are meant more for enterprise graphics and visual capabilities rather than AI. The Arc Pro B50 and B60, however, offer more memory and functionalities that are designed specifically with AI in mind. The B50 is a mainstream chip that Intel says is designed for AI-assisted software engineering. According to the company, entry workstation GPUs make up about 30% of the workstation market, offering Intel a clear opportunity to grab market share. \"We expect this to be very competitive and a very attractive solution, particularly for design and engineering,\" Intel vice president and general manager of client graphics Vivian Lien told Yahoo Finance. To do that, Intel has equipped the Arc Pro B50 with 16GB of memory and support for up to 170 TOPS, or trillions of operations per second. TOPS is a generally accepted means of measuring an AI chip's rough performance capabilities. The Arc Pro B60 has 24GB of memory and is capable of up to 197 TOPS. According to Lien, that chip is aimed at workstation customers who want to run resource-intensive AI applications. Intel, like Nvidia (NVDA), is touting the need for customers to opt for high-end graphics chips to power AI models into the future. To that end, the company is also introducing its Project Battlematrix workstation system. A complete PC, Project Battlematrix combines two to eight Arc Pro B60 GPUs supporting up to 192GB of memory with an Intel Xeon processor. Customers can use it to run AI software across their businesses. Intel isn't the only company with its own workstation GPUs or heavy-duty AI desktop systems. Nvidia has also announced its own RTX Pro AI chips and cards, as well as two desktop systems, the DGX Spark and DGX Station. The DGX Spark is a pint-sized supercomputer that runs on Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB10 superchip. Then there's Nvidia's DGX Station. Outfitted with the company's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra superchip, the DGX Station provides up to 784GB of memory for AI applications. Intel is working to prove that it's not backing away from the GPU market while also proving it has what it takes to reclaim its crown atop the CPU market. While the B50 and B60 might not be as powerful as Nvidia's offerings, they're clear indications that the company is dedicated to gaining ground in the AI workstation market. But it still has to prove it can hang in the larger, more lucrative hyperscaler market. And that remains to be seen. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "In recent years, stocks in theartificial intelligence(AI) field have become known for achieving sky-high valuations.Nvidiashot higher amid surprisingly strong demand for AI accelerators, and recently,Palantir's valuation has reached nosebleed levels as its software delivers notable productivity breakthroughs. Still, this success has not applied to allAI stocks, and many appearundervalued. That creates a possible opportunity in companies that investors may have overlooked, increasing the odds that you can generate outsized returns by investing in artificial intelligence. To this end, investors may want to take a closer look atAlphabet(GOOGL1.32%)(GOOG1.16%),Advanced Micro Devices(AMD1.91%), andQualcomm(QCOM-0.06%). Image source: Getty Images. It may surprise some investors to see Google parent Alphabet selling at aP/E ratioof 19. The company is an AI pioneer, first applying the technology in 2001. Moreover, it is one of the more cash-rich businesses in existence, generating $75 billion infree cash flowover the last 12 months and holding $95 billion inliquidity. Still, skepticism about the stock likely relates to the lucrative search business that generated much of that cash. Competition from ChatGPT took its market share in search below 90% for the first time in years, according to Oberlo. However, Alphabet has long made it a goal to become less reliant on search and the corresponding ad business. To that end, advertising was 74% of revenue in the first quarter of 2025, down from 77% in the year-ago quarter. Google Cloud raised its revenue share to 14%, growing from 12% over the same period. Additionally, Alphabet owns numerous businesses, some of which could emerge as primary revenue sources. One of these is autonomous vehicle company Waymo, which investors recently valued at $45 billion during a funding round. Ultimately, when considering the cash position and business, a 19 P/E ratio is a low price to pay for such optionality. AMD may be one of the more surprising stocks to be overlooked. It is arguably the most prominent CPU maker, pulling ahead of longtime leaderIntel. Also, even though it lags Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, it looks increasingly like a rising player in that industry. Still, investors have sold off the stock in recent months as its gaming and embedded segments suffered. Even with a partial recovery, it sells at an approximate 50% discount from its all-time high in early 2024. Nonetheless, the stock's long-term investors may now see signs of hope. In the first quarter of 2025, revenue of $7.4 billion increased by 36% yearly, far above the 2% annual increase in the year-ago quarter. Its data center and client segments remained robust, growing revenue by 57% and 68%, respectively. Also, the embedded segment has begun to pare losses, with its annual decline down to 3%. Moreover, the 30% yearly decline in gaming revenue is an improvement over past quarters, likely meaning these segments are finally emerging from their down cycles. Finally, while its 86 trailing P/E ratio may look pricey, aforward P/E ratioof 29 may make the stock inexpensive, given the company's improving revenue growth. That means the recent rise in the stock price should probably continue. Another AI stock that suffers from negative sentiment is Qualcomm. The smartphone chipset giant faces some notable headwinds with its extensive ties to China and the decision byAppleto develop chipsets in-house. Nonetheless, one can argue that the stock price accounts for these factors (and then some). The stock trades at just 16 times earnings, and the forward P/E ratio of 13 indicates its profit growth will continue. Moreover,DeepSeek's breakthrough earlier this year offers lower-cost AI technology, presumably making AI accessible to more users. That bodes well for Qualcomm's chipset business, which has begun to benefit from an AI-driven upgrade cycle. The chipset business was the primary reason its revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended March 30) rose 17% annually to $11 billion. Furthermore, Qualcomm has made strides in its Internet of Things and automotive businesses. These enterprises grew revenue on a yearly basis by 27% and 59%, respectively, which bodes well for Qualcomm's efforts to prepare for a day when smartphones are less critical to consumers. Indeed, the ties to China and Apple's decision to drop Qualcomm have likely pressured Qualcomm stock. Still, considering the low P/E ratio and fast growth of its businesses, the stock looks increasingly like a buy.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Mizuho has lifted price targets for several AI server-related stocks, citing rising demand and momentum across the supply chain. The brokerage raised its target for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) to $135 from $117, for Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) to $145 from $140, and for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) to $40 from $32, while maintaining an Outperform or Neutral rating across the group. Ahead of upcoming earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:CRDO), and Dell, Mizuho held its quarterly AI Server Call with analysts Dale Gai in Japan and Kevin Wang in Hong Kong. In a Friday note to clients, Mizuho highlighted several takeaways from the call. Specifically, the broker believes that Broadcom stands to benefit from \u201cstrong ramps for Custom Silicon ASICs\u201d into 2026, supported by Google\u2019s MTIA2 and anticipated deployments from OpenAI and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The analysts see \u201cpotential for upside to AVGO CoWoS demand into 2026E,\u201d even as capacity could exceed 100,000 wafers. Despite no price target change for Broadcom, the firm reiterated its Outperform rating and $250 price target. Meanwhile, analysts note that Nvidia\u2019s near-term earnings may be mixed due to the H20 phase-out and slower Blackwell ramp, but they remain optimistic about the second half of the year, when the \u201cGB200 NVL72 ramps up along with GB200/300 HGX shipments.\u201d The analysts maintained their $168 price target and Outperform rating on Nvidia. Tailwinds from President Trump\u2019s Middle East visit were also flagged. Mizuho highlighted SMCI\u2019s $20 billion partnership with DataVolt, AMD\u2019s $10 billion collaboration with HUMAIN, and Nvidia\u2019s expected benefit from a 500,000 GPU annual allocation to the UAE. \u201cWe see incremental benefit with President Trump\u2019s ME \u2018Sheikh-UP,\u2019\u201d the report stated. For AMD, the firm also pointed to the upcoming MI355X GPU ramp in the second half of 2025 as a potential offset to headwinds from the MI308 shipment ban into China. For Dell, the price target hike was mainly driven by a strong AI server pipeline and expected PC refresh cycle. SMCI, meanwhile, saw its price target hiked thanks to its leadership in AI server deployments, but analysts cautioned on \u201cincreasing competition and weak AI server margins.\u201d Mizuho also reiterated its Outperform rating on Credo, keeping its target at $70, citing strong hyperscaler engagement and growth potential in data center interconnect solutions.

Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing lower as investors weigh Moody's U.S. credit downgrade while preparing forearnings, Fed speak, and housing datathis week.Nasdaqfutures are 1.6% lower after the tech-focused indexgained more than 7% last week.S&P 500andDow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are lower by 1.2% and 0.7%, respectively, after the indexes also posted strong gains last week.\u00a0Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is falling to trade around the $103,000 level, while oil futures also are dropping. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and gold futures are rising. Moody's ratings agencydowngraded the U.S. governmentfrom its top-notch credit rating, citing \"persistent, large fiscal deficits\" that show no signs of slowing. The downgrade places the U.S. government one rung below Moody\u2019s Aaa status. The rating cut comes as Congress considers a budget that would extend significant tax cuts and boost spending, which is currently under discussion in the House of Representatives. Moody's projected U.S. debt would swell to 134% of the country's GDP by 2035, up from 98% last year. Walmart (WMT) shares are 2% lower in premarket trading after President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post that theretail giant should absorb tariffs on goodsmade in China and other countries instead of raising prices. The company recently warned that it would be forced to hike prices. Trump responded this weekend on Truth Social that the retail giant made \"BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u00a0last year, far more than expected,\" and that between Walmart and China \"should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS.'\" Trump's comments come as several companies have said they areconsidering raising pricesin response totariff hikes.

Stocks across the board on Monday sold off sharply as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose above the key 4.5% level. Another market surprise lying in the weeds is the third quarter earnings season, which typically begins in mid-October. Pros think the cumulative effect of tariffs will be most severe in the third quarter, much to the dismay of upbeat analysts who continue to expect bumper corporate profits. \"I think there's a lag between the tariff announcements and when they actually hit the earnings,\" Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said on Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bidpodcast (see video above or listen below). \"So I suspect it's more likely that third quarter numbers that are going to soften a little bit.\" Parkerheldthe chief US equity strategist role at Sanford Bernstein and Morgan Stanley before founding Trivariate Research in 2021. He correctly predicted the sell-off in \"Magnificent Seven\" names \u2014 Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG) \u2014 this year, putting out abearish note in early Februarybefore the slide in the closely watched group. Parker added about earnings that \"you could get a little bit of a wave where not everyone misses at the same time. But I currently think the Q2 numbers are probably OK, but the third and fourth quarter numbers are actually embedding in some sectors higher than normal [earnings].\" Read more:How to protect your money during economic turmoil, stock market volatility Thesecond quarter earnings season, which is coming to a close soon, has lulled investors into a false sense of security about the profit impact of tariffs. Tariffs won't initially be felt by companies until the current quarter, and then they will be felt more in the third quarter if they stay at current levels. About 78% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have reported a positive earnings per share (EPS) surprise for the first quarter, above the five-year average, according to data from FactSet. S&P 500 companies are exceeding EPS estimates for first quarter results by roughly 8.5% in the aggregate, relatively in line with the five-year average. But the concerns expressed by Parker on the outlook for profits have been conveyed by execs on earnings calls \u2014 something investors may be missing given how quickly they have bid up stock prices after the\"Liberation Day\" massacre. On a percentage basis, the terms \u201ctariff\u201d or \u201ctariffs\u201d have been cited on 91% of the 451 earnings calls conducted by S&P 500 companies since March 15, FactSet data shows. About 381 companies from the S&P 500 that have reported cited the term \u201cuncertainty\u201d during their earnings calls for the first quarter. This number is well above the five-year average of 224 and the 10-year average of 179. This number is also more than double the number recorded in the previous quarter. \"The third quarter is where I start to get concerned,\" one top executive at a Fortune 500 company told Yahoo Finance on the earnings outlook for companies.

        "content": "May 19- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are trading at their lowest collectivevaluation since 2018, according to a note from Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The group's next-twelve-month price-to-earnings ratio stands at about 28x on aggregate, versus roughly 20x for the broader S&P 493, a 43% premium that sits in the 30th percentile of the past decade. Kostin said the recent pullback likely reflects investor caution over heavy AI spending, shifting trade policies, and ongoing antitrust actions. Yet, the median stock in the cohort currently trades at a slight discount to what Goldman's cross-sectional model would suggest based on forecasts for earnings growth and balance-sheet strength. He noted risks run both ways. In the near term, lighter positioning, lower relative multiples, and renewed AI enthusiasm after first-quarter earnings may support these shares. However, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta face active antitrust probes in the US and Europe. Competitive pressure also remains a concern. Recent reports of Apple's plans for an AI-driven search feature sent Alphabet's shares down by about 7%, highlighting the margin for disruption within the elite seven.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the Middle East marks a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for U.S. tech companies, driven by major developments in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming crystal clear the AI Revolution has found its next major area of penetration... the Middle East,\u201d Wedbush wrote in a note. The analyst highlighted the recent announcements in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi as signs of a new era of growth for U.S. tech giants such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Wedbush notes that Saudi Arabia has committed to purchasing 18,000 Nvidia chips for a 500-megawatt data center being built by Humain. Meanwhile, the UAE has received support from President Trump to build \u201cthe largest AI data center outside the U.S.\u201d in Abu Dhabi. \u201cWe believe the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming year,\u201d Wedbush said. The developments come amid a broader shift in U.S. trade policy. \u201cNo Nvidia chips for China... red carpet rollout for the Kingdom,\u201d the firm wrote, contrasting Middle East expansion with chip export restrictions affecting Beijing. Ives called the momentum in the region \u201ca bullish indicator that further shows the U.S. tech\u2019s lead in this 4th Industrial Revolution.\u201d He emphasized Nvidia\u2019s dominance, again referring to CEO Jensen Huang as \u201cthe Godfather of AI.\u201d Wedbush believes Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar are now on the \u201cpriority list\u201d for U.S. tech, with regional demand for AI chips, software, robotics, and data centers expected to surge over the next decade.

Moody's announcing Friday evening, it was stripping the American government of its top credit rating, citing concerns over the country's ballooning budget deficit and rising debt. Longer dated Treasury yields rose to the psychological 5% level for the first time since 2023. And in Washington, President Trump's giant tax and spending package has advanced through a key House Committee after facing hurdles last week. The bill still has to secure a full vote in the House before heading to the Senate, where it'll likely face fresh challenges. The package includes major spending increase for immigration enforcement and the military. It would also extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire at the end of this year.

Nuvaxovid differs from current COVID-19 vaccines on the market because it is protein-based, not mRNA-based.

Novavax noted that the deal has \"layers of value\" for the company, with Sanofi leading the commercialization of Nuvaxovid beginning this year, and Novavax eligible to \"receive ongoing tiered royalties from stand-alone COVID-19 vaccine sales for all future vaccination seasons.\" It expects commercial delivery of the 2025-2026 version of Nuvaxovid this fall. CEO John Jacobs explained that demand should be strong, since market research and federal health data show that \"older individuals and those with underlying conditions are the populations most likely to seek out COVID-19 vaccination seasonally.\" Novavax shares had been down 16% year-to-date entering Monday.

        "content": "[source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/treasury-bond-selloff-30-year-10-yield-3f6ee00b)  Let\u2019s talk about the slow-motion implosion happening over at Tesla, because this is Elon trying to throw every \u201cdemand lever\u201d like a malfunctioning Tesla Bot pulling fire alarms on a sinking ship.  So here\u2019s the situation, Tesla\u2019s U.S. sales are cratering. Consumers are tired of the drama, tired of Elon\u2019s clown-car Twitter politics, tired of being beta testers for features that don\u2019t work, and now, finally, the demand curve is saying \u201cnah.\u201d So what\u2019s Tesla\u2019s big strategic response? Discounts. Discounts on\u00a0*everything*. They\u2019re slashing prices like it\u2019s Black Friday at a liquidation sale. You breathe near a Tesla showroom and suddenly you're eligible for a rebate. They used to offer $1,000 off for military folks. Now? That\u2019s ballooned into a \u201cplease anyone take our cars\u201d campaign: students, teachers, first responders, retirees, spouses, surviving spouses \u2014 if you\u2019ve ever paid taxes or watched\u00a0*Top Gun*, you\u2019re probably on the list. They even rolled out Lyft driver incentives: take delivery of a Tesla, do 100 rides, and boom, $2,000 in combined credits. Like the car version of \u201cplease clap.\u201d  And because that wasn\u2019t enough, they\u2019re pushing out desperate Cybertruck emails. You know, the 4-ton wedge of disappointment they promised in 2019? Now reservation holders are being told they\u2019ve got until June 15 to lock in a \u201cdeal\u201d on Full Self-Driving for $7,000. Otherwise, it jumps to $8,000 because nothing says \u201cbuy now\u201d like paying more for something that still doesn\u2019t actually drive itself. Oh, and interest rates? Gone. They're offering 0% financing on the Model 3, and 1.99% on the Model Y. If they could throw in a free foot massage and a box of frozen taquitos, they probably would. Because inventory is stacking up. These cars are\u00a0*not*\u00a0moving. Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter missed expectations by 50,000 units, and they tried to blame it on \u201cproduction retooling\u201d for the Model Y. But here in Q2, with production back to full speed, they still can\u2019t sell them. That\u2019s not a factory issue, that\u2019s a brand problem.  And let\u2019s be real here, this isn\u2019t just about cars. Tesla\u2019s stock price, its entire market cap \u2014 it\u2019s all built on vibes and sci-fi. Elon\u2019s selling the idea that we\u2019re gonna live in a Jetsons-style future where humanoid robots fold your laundry and your car thinks for you. But guess what? Most people don\u2019t want a robot nanny or a car that second-guesses their every turn signal. They want a normal-ass vehicle that works, is affordable, and doesn\u2019t come bundled with the ego of a Bond villain.  Even Tesla employees are over it. There\u2019s an open letter from inside the company calling for Musk to step down because and I\u2019m paraphrasing he\u2019s torpedoing the brand with his nonsense. And you can see the receipts. Thousands of unsold Model Ys sitting on lots across the U.S. That\u2019s not innovation. That\u2019s oversupply. That\u2019s mismanagement. That\u2019s hubris with four wheels, a touchscreen, and trip to Mars in 2440.  And don\u2019t even get me started on Europe and China \u2014 where Tesla\u2019s slashing interest rates so aggressively it\u2019s basically giving cars away with a sad trombone sound.  Tesla\u2019s pulling every emergency lever it has to keep the illusion alive. But when you\u2019ve got falling sales, bloated inventory, collapsing consumer goodwill, and your CEO is a walking PR disaster, discounts won\u2019t save you. Eventually, the hype runs out. And all that\u2019s left is the sound of unsold Cybertrucks rusting in a Texas parking lot. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but either way I'm not happy about any of this and the people getting affected by it all.",

Monday morning\u2019s dip came after Moody\u2019s Ratings on Fridaydowngraded U.S. debtto AA1 from AAA, the highest possible rating.

        "content": "If you've ever looked at a stock price chart and felt a bit overwhelmed by all the lines, bars, and colors, you're definitely not alone. Learning how to read a chart begins with understanding that there is a story in every chart. That story is the price's journey, and once you know what to look for, it becomes much easier to see opportunities and make informed trading or investing decisions. We run down a list of basic chart-building blocks below to get you started on your chart-reading journey. Tradingview Start by picking the right type of chart\u2014line, bar, or candlestick. Candlestick chartsare the go-to for most traders because they are visually appealing and offer more information than bar charts and line charts.Line chartsplot only closing prices, whilebar charts offerslightly less detail than candlesticks and are less visually appealing. For most stocks and commodities, charts are available in timeframes ranging from 1 minute to 1 month, and the same price patterns tend to repeat across all timeframes. You'll want tochoose a timeframethat matches your intended holding period. Day traders look at everything from 1-minute charts to daily charts. A swing trader might look at the weekly, daily, and hourly charts, while a position trader might focus on the weekly and daily charts. It's important to look at multiple time frames simultaneously. Sometimes, a chart showing a healthy uptrend on an hourly chart might show a significant area of resistance on the daily chart. Some traders and investors swear thatprice actionis all you need to trade the markets. This is because they believe that price action contains the conviction of all market participants. For those able to read price charts competently, the market itself, through price action contained in the chart, will reveal what it's doing and, to some degree, where it's headed. At the very least, you canidentify trendsand likelysupport and resistance. You can also look to spot recurringchart patterns. The most fundamental and widely used momentum indicator is themoving average. In timeframes generally ranging from 5 to 200 periods, moving averages can help you quickly identify whether a market is trending and bearish or bullish. TheRelative Strength Index (RSI)shows when a market might beoverboughtoroversold, while volume often indicates whether a move has institutional weight behind it. But don't look at charts in a vacuum. Always keep the bigger picture in mind. Know what's happening with the economy, market sentiment, and in the news. That's how the best decisions come together. Learning how to read a chart gives you an edge in the markets. It helps you spot trends, recognizeimportant price levels, and make decisions grounded in actual market behavior, bringing more clarity to your trades or portfolio choices. Start small. Pick one market and one or two indicators and build your skills from there. Over time, these tools can help you make smarter, more strategic moves.",

During\u00a0an interview with technology analyst Ben Thompson, Huang called the ban \"enormously costly\" and \"deeply painful.\" He pointed to the $5.5 billion in charges the company expects to see in its first fiscal quarter due to the ban.  \"No company in history has ever written off that much inventory,\" he said. \"\\[N\\]ot only am I losing $5.5 billion \u2014 we wrote off $5.5 billion \u2014 we walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably ... $3 billion worth of taxes.\"  Wall Street analysts had projected that Nvidia could see anywhere between a $10 billion and $16 billion hit to revenue over the coming quarters from the most recent export ban on its H20 chips.  Nvidia has repeatedly updated its chips for the Chinese market in the past several years to comply with ever-tightening US trade restrictions, making the chips less and less powerful with each new iteration.  The latest ban on exports of its chips last month came just as\u00a0the US government said it was investigating Nvidia\u00a0over the use of its AI chips in China. It cited the release of\u00a0a cheap AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek\u00a0powered by\u00a0Nvidia's prior-generation H800s, which are currently banned from export to the country.  Huang implied Nvidia can't make another AI chip with its Hopper architecture for China under the current restrictions: \"\\[T\\]hat\u2019s the limit of what we can do to Hopper, and we've cut it down to there's not much left to cut,\" he said. \"Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed.\"  He added that the China AI market is worth $50 billion a year. \"China's doing fantastic, 50% of the world's AI researchers are Chinese and you're not going to hold them back, you're not going to stop them from advancing AI,\" he told Thompson, who published the interview in his newsletter, Stratechery.  Last week, the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0and\u00a0Reuters\u00a0said Nvidia is looking to open a research and development center in China, which a person familiar with the matter confirmed in an email to Yahoo Finance.  Just as Nvidia's H20 chips were banned, Chinese tech giant Huawei was rushing to fill the gap. Huawei is\u00a0reportedly set to ship chips more powerful than Nvidia's H100s.  Huang called Huawei \"formidable\" and \"a world-class technology company.\"  Nvidia is set to report its first quarter earnings on May 28. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a note to investors Monday that Nvidia executives' post-earnings call with analysts \"could be contentious\" due to the recent H20 restrictions.  Trump's restrictive trade policies \u2014 his tariffs and AI chip export curbs to China \u2014 have\u00a0sent Nvidia stock tumbling\u00a0in recent months, just as investors are scrutinizing whether Big Tech can sustain its hundreds of billions in spending on AI infrastructure.  The stock got a reprieve last week\u00a0after Trump eased US chip trade restrictions with the rest of the world, scrapping a Biden-era rule that was set to cap AI chip exports to most countries. Optimism over its deal to supply chips for Saudi Arabia's AI buildout also boosted the stock.  Despite his criticism of the China export ban, Huang said, \"The President has a vision of what he wants to achieve, I support the President, I believe in the President, and I think that he'll create a great outcome for America, and he'll do it with respect and with an attitude of wanting to compete, but also looking for opportunities to cooperate.\"  Nvidia stock wavered Monday\u00a0as market turmoil overshadowed the AI chipmaker's product update at Computex.",

        "content": "BofA Securitiesanalyst Vivek Arya maintained a Buy rating onNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) with aprice forecast of $160on Monday. Arya listened to Nvidia CEO\u2019s Computex 2025 keynote and then had a chance to virtually catch up with management (CFO) after the event. The analyst highlighted Nvidia\u2019s expanding portfolio, TAM (Total Addressable Market) expansion with the new NVLINK Fusion, rack-scale in full production, RTX Pro enterprise server, and sovereign AI buildout. Also Read:Nvidia Unveils AI Tools For Humanoid Robots, Launches Quantum-AI Supercomputer To Drive Next Tech Era Nvidia Arya\u2019s top sector pick. The company\u2019s expanding portfolio implies a broad set of AI products across cloud, enterprise, humanoid robots, workstations, gaming, software libraries, quantum, and 6G, all underlying what Nvidia referred to as a \u201cmulti-trillion dollar AI factory\u201d industry, per the analyst. He noted that TAM expansion with the new NVLINK Fusion opened Nvidia\u2019s proprietary interconnect and networking tech to third-party custom accelerators (ASICs) and CPUs. Arya is highly confident in rack-scale GB200 NVL 72 Blackwell Systems, and the transition path to next-gen Blackwell Ultra GB300 systems will be easier from the third quarter. The analyst said the RTX Pro enterprise server extends AI into the enterprise, causing more competition for legacy x86. He also highlighted some benefits from last week\u2019s Middle-East deals in the second half of 2025, though more benefits will be seen from 2026 onward (a 5-year project), given the time required to set up new infrastructure. As per Arya, the next significant catalyst is the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, which could be contentious, related to recent restrictions on China H20 shipments. As per the analyst, Nvidia\u2019s key differentiators include its ability to expand its addressable market across multiple vectors of silicon, systems, software, and services, drive scale with global supply-chain partners, and solid balance sheet to make strategic investments in the ecosystem. With NVLInk Fusion, Nvidia can provide its proprietary interconnect fabric and switch (Spectrum) to cloud service providers for use as chiplet in systems with (modified) third-party ASICs (from partnersMarvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)) or extend the integration of Nvidia GPU with otherArm Holdings(NASDAQ:ARM)-based CPU (Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM)) Arya noted. Separately, Nvidia launched Grace CPU C1, a new single-socket CPU for power efficient edge, telco, and storage systems, competing against rival x86 products fromIntel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), he added. Although Nvidia said it was incredibly challenging, Grace Blackwell is in full production. The analyst noted that his management discussion suggests a higher level of confidence in the rollout and robust demand. Unlike GTC, it did not provide any specific metrics on cloud orders. Nvidia is on track to upgrade to Grace Blackwell GB300 in the third quarter, which has similar architecture as GB200 but with an upgraded Blackwell chip, 1.5x more inference likely due to its 1.5x more high-bandwidth memory and 2x networking, Arya said. The analyst highlighted that management made no specific comments on gross margin progression. Last, no new Hopper or salvage of China H20 products were written down recently; only low-volume L20 is being sold, he said. He added that China is still important at $50 billion TAM per Nvidia.

Last month, the administration effectively\u00a0banned\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.  \u201cThis additional ban on Nvidia\u2019s H20 is deeply painful,\u201d Huang\u00a0said\u00a0in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. \u201cWe walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably\u2014what is it? \u2014 $3 billion worth of taxes\u201d for the U.S.  Critics have said offering Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence chips to China\u2014even one or two generations old\u2014can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei\u2019s AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei\u2019s chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia\u2019s current CUDA software advantage could erode.  \u201cAnybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we\u2019re not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they\u2019re not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.\u201d  The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia\u2019s products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&D to compete with Nvidia.",

We'll learn more this week, when the parent companies of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Ross Dress for Less report their latest earnings. Investors have been considering whether import taxes will be a net negative or positive for the off-price sector. Retailers may have to spend more to stock their shelves, analysts have said, but if tariffs broadly push up prices, consumers may rely more on discount stores. TJX Cos. (TJX) parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods, is slated to release its first-quarter results Wednesday morning.UBS analysts expect TJX to trim its earnings per share outlook for 2025, but said the retailer can likely mitigate the impact of tariffs through price increases and other strategies. \u201cWe anticipate consumers increasing shopping dollars towards TJX\u2019s businesses for its favorable value proposition as tariffs drive price increases across the broad retail landscape,\u201d UBS wrote last week.

Bernstein Managing Director and Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon expands upon Nvidia's partnerships with other chip players \u2014 such as MediaTek (2454.TW) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) \u2014 and what this all means for other competitors, such as Qualcomm (QCOM) after it inks AI deals with Saudi Arabian developers. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. that idea, Stacy, of opening up the the ecosystem, ecosystem to other chip makers. Why did do you think they made that decision and announcement now, one? And then the partners they announced, Stacy. So, um, Marvel, MediaTek, I'm interested curious to get your take on on those partners but also you take on on who we didn't hear about. Yeah, I know you you bet. And so they sort of kind of announced it a little bit before they announced something with with the MediaTek at GTC that sort of, um, you know, implied some of this. And so this gave us a little more concrete details on what they're doing. Um, yeah, look, I mean, so they are partnering with other ASIC vendors again, like a Marvel or an All Chip or even a MediaTek that make AI ASICs for other players. Like I think in some sense it probably is an acknowledgement that they that the ASIC, you know, opportunity is real. And look, I figure like if folks are doing ASICs, they're going to do them anyways. Like you might as well try to extend your ecosystem into that and make them partners as much as you can. So I think that's fine. You asked like who is not in it though. It is interesting in Intel and AMD and even Broadcom. So they actually have a competing, um, uh, interconnect standard. It's called UA link. Um, I think it stands for universal accelerator like I think. But it's like an open source competitor to this this NV link, um, uh, interconnect technology that they've been trying to build. And so in some sense, this is encouraging other players not to go down that route but rather to partner with Nvidia on those on on that interconnect technology. I could also imagine that that, you know, those other guys in Intel and Broadcom probably less excited interested potentially in in partnering with Nvidia and they're they're clearly not they're going to go try to do their own thing. But you are sort of setting up a couple of different paths and you already have one. I mean, the the Nvidia ecosystem is already pretty well established. To the extent that Jensen can help to drive that into some of these other areas it puts a lot of pressure potentially on some of the up and coming ecosystems. They're always it's always hard to get new ecosystems kind of like traction to get them started anyways. So definitely makes it harder. Yeah. Well, one of the other interesting partnerships that they announced that Nvidia talked about, or I guess Qualcomm talked about, is with Qualcomm, uh, because Qualcomm is now going to make custom CPUs that will work with Nvidia's GPUs, as I understand it. Um, and I was reading a recent note of yours where you talked about that you're what feels like a lonely bull on Qualcomm. Um, so I was wondering first your reaction to this news and then how it feeds into that thesis on Qualcomm. Yeah. Yeah, you bet. You bet. So so last week we there was a lot of announcements that came out of the Middle East and Qualcomm even there had had announced a partnership, um, in the at least, I think with Saudi Arabia to make, um, uh, uh, chips effectively for AI data centers. And I would say as of last week it was a little bit unclear how that was going to work. Like, so they were going to do CPUs and and then what? Like, so at least now we have a better idea of probably what those plans are. They will presumably be data centers with Nvidia GPUs and then you know, the the GPUs have CPUs that go along with them. They will be Qualcomm CPUs and now it's clearer how those CPUs will actually work with the Nvidia GPUs. So I think it makes that that entire opportunity for Qualcomm at least more credible. I think more broadly, look, people have not Qualcomm's been tough, you know, it's it's it's it's been a smartphone story. Investors have been kind of hesitant to play smartphone stories. They have an Apple headwind, which is very well known, but Apple is starting to to do their own chips and designing them out. And so it kind of limits the headline EPS growth for a while. At the same time, there is a real diversification story and Qualcomm's talked about this pretty extensively across auto and and an IOT and other things, um, that makes them less dependent on handsets over time. And you know, there's an AI edge story which I think they're a beneficiary, but this this makes the overall like AI story for Qualcomm better, I think, and it's clearly not getting any kind of AI multiple. You know, the stock right now is about, oh, 12 times earnings. Even if I took all of Apple out, maybe it's 14 times earnings. Um, so but it makes that diversification story I think even more credible than it was. So I think it's good.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang sharply criticized U.S. export restrictions on AI chips, warning that the rules are diminishing America\u2019s technology leadership while inflicting heavy financial damage on the company. \u201cIf the goal of the diffusion rule is to ensure that America has to lead, the diffusion rule as it was written will exactly cause us to lose our lead,\u201d Huang said in a recent Stratechery interview. The company has been barred from selling advanced chips like the H20 to China, a key market for its AI infrastructure. As a result, Huang revealed that NVIDIA wrote off $5.5 billion in inventory and forfeited approximately $15 billion in sales. \u201cNo company in history has ever written off that much inventory,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably... $3 billion worth of taxes.\u201d Huang argued that cutting off China risks unintentionally strengthening rival ecosystems by forcing them to innovate domestically beyond U.S. influence. \u201cIf we don\u2019t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we\u2019re not there to compete for it\u2026 their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world,\u201d he warned.

Leading up to that reading, 30-year rates surged a remarkable 44 basis points, for their biggest Friday-to-Friday gain since June 2022 and their most expensive average in almost 11 months. However, things were much better in September, when the 30-year average plunged to a two-year low of 5.89% (the cheapest Friday average being 6.03%). So far this year, the lowest weekly reading has been 6.55%. Every business day, we publishnational rate averages for various loan types, and alsoeach state's 30-year rate average. Right now, the cheapest state averages range from 6.81% to 6.99%. Rates on 15-year new purchase loansare down even more in the past five weeks, sitting a bold 26 basis points lower at an average of 6.05% on Friday.Still, the current reading is more than a percentage point above the two-year low of 4.97% registered in September. Rates on jumbo 30-year new purchase loans have declined 18 basis points across five weeks, landing Friday at a 6.97% average. That's compared to a 2025 high of 7.15%. In contrast, September rates on new 30-year jumbo loans sank as far as 6.24%, with the lowest weekly average registering at 6.39%.

        "content": "Quantum Computing (QUBT) shares tumbled Monday after jumping 50% last week when the photonic and quantum optics provider flagged progress at its planned quantum chip foundry. CEO Yuping Huang said last Thursday the company had completed construction of its Arizona-based foundry, a factory that will process the materials used in the photonic chips that power specific quantum machines. The firm also said it had secured its fifth purchase order and deepened its engagement with both government and commercial partners.The company also announced itswung to a profitin the first quarter on benefits from an earlier acquisition and growing demand for its photonic semiconductors. Quantum Computing shares fell 8.1% to close Monday's session at $11.83 . The stock has doubled from last-month's low and has gained more than 1,000% over the past month as investors bet that the company\u2019s chips will powerquantum technologyhelping to revolutionize industries likecybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. Below, we take a closer look at Quantum Computing\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify crucial price levels worth watching out for. After breaking above afalling wedgepattern in mid-March, Quantum Computing shares consolidated before resuming theiruptrendin late April. More recently, the stock broke out above apennant patternin Friday\u2019s trading session, signaling a continuation move higher. Importantly, the buying occurred on the highest dailyvolumesince mid-January, indicating that larger market players participated in the rally. Meanwhile, therelative strength indexconfirms bullish momentum, but also flashesoverboughtconditions, which could lead to short-term volatility. Let\u2019s take a closer look at two crucial overhead areas on Quantum Computing\u2019s chart that will remain in focus if the stock continues to track higher and also point out several majorsupport levelsworth monitoring during retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $20. This level may provide selling pressure near a briefconsolidationperiod in late December that formed on the chart just below the stock\u2019srecord high. It\u2019s worth pointing out that this location also roughly matches a projected measured move price target that calculates the distance between the falling wedge pattern\u2019s two trendlines and adds that amount to the mid-March breakout point. For instance, adding $14 to $6, forecasts a target of $20. A decisive close above this level could see the shares make another run toward $27. Investors who have bought at lower prices may seekexit pointsin this region near the stock\u2019sall-time highset in mid-December. Further selling could see the shares initially revisit support around $9, a location on the chart that may attract buying interest near a trendline connecting a range of correspondingprice actionstretching back to early December. Finally, the bulls\u2019 failure to defend this important support level opens the door for a more significant drop to $6.

After trading in negative territory for much of the day, the S&P 500 gained strength in the afternoon to end 0.1% higher. The Dow was up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq managed a slender gain above last week's closing level.\u00a0ReadInvestopedia'sfull coverage of theday's trading here. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)\u00a0stock jumped 8.2%, marking the top daily performance in the S&P 500. While Monday's move higher extended a recovery that began late last week, shares of the insurance giant had been under heavy pressure after reports of aJustice Department investigationinto possible Medicare fraud compounded news about the departure of UnitedHealth's top executive and suspension of its guidance. As the stock rebounded, filings showed that incoming CEO Stephen Hemsley purchased a significant stake in the company. The Food and Drug Administration granted full approval for the protein-based COVID-19 vaccine produced by Novavax (NVAX), and shares of the biotech firm surged 15%. Shares of fellow vaccine maker Moderna (MRNA) were up 6.2%. Dollar General (DG) shares advanced 4.9%, adding to gains posted at the end of last week after Walmart (WMT) discussed tariff-related price increases on its earnings call. Analysts have highlighted that Dollar General has limited tariff exposure compared with some of its rivals in discount retail. Shares of several solar energy companies moved lower after Republican leaders in the House reportedly committed to eliminating certain clean energy tax credits earlier than anticipated. An initial budget proposal from the House Ways and Means Committee released last week included plans to roll back many provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for residential solar installations. Shares of panel manufacturer First Solar (FSLR) sank 7.6%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock, while shares of solar equipment maker Enphase Energy (ENPH) lost 3.2%. The uncertain policy outlook pressured other stocks in the renewable energy space. Shares of power generator AES Corp. (AES), whose portfolio includes solar, wind, hydro, and energy storage projects, fell 4.1%. Best Buy (BBY) shares sank 3% after Wells Fargo trimmed its price target on the electronics retailer's stock. Although analysts noted the potential for customers to pull forward their purchases in anticipation of tariff impacts, they remain cautious of significant uncertainties and risks in the market.",

        "content": "If you've seen the movieThe Big Short, which is based on the novel by Michael Lewis and features acclaimed actors Steve Carrell, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Jeremy Strong, then you probably know who Michael Burry is. The former Stanford neurology resident rose to prominence while posting stock ideas online during the early days of the internet. His ideas were so good that he eventually left the medical field to launch his own fund. Prior to the Great Recession, Burry correctly bet against the housing market, making hundreds of millions in profits for his fund, Scion Capital. Now, Burry runs another fund called Scion Asset Management, which happened to sell nearly all of its stocks in the first quarter, while also buying put options. Did Burry just pull off another \"big short\" trade? It certainly looks that way. Burry never runs too large of a portfolio, typically holding about a dozen stocks, plus or minus a few. In the first quarter, he sold nearly all of his holdings. He had been quite bullish on China, owning large Chinese stocks likeAlibaba,Baidu,JD.Com, andPDD Holdings. But after selling these stocks, he also purchased put options on these names. Put options are similar to call options but in the opposite direction, essentially betting that a stock price will decline. Burry also purchased put options onNvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Now, keep in mind that the 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission only shows us Scion's positions at the close of trading on March 31. We have no idea at what point during the first quarter Burry sold or at what price. However, it's quite possible that Burry saw rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China and decided to get ahead of a potential marketwide sell-off caused bytariffs. If this was the case, then Burry pulled off another \"big short\" trade and timed it perfectly because the market absolutely collapsed in early April after President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day,\" falling nearly 20% from highs made in February. Nvidia, at one point this year, traded 30% lower and was down much more from highs made during the year. Nvidia not only got hit by the trade war but also after the Trump administrationplaced export restrictionson certain semiconductor chips to China. Nvidia does a substantial amount of business in China, but the stock has recovered a lot since the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on higher tariff rates against one another. NVDAdata byYCharts. Interestingly, Burry's lone remaining long position is the multinational cosmetics companyEst\u00e9e Lauder, which is down over 50% in the last year (as of May 16). Scion actually doubled its position in the company in the first quarter. It's not uncommon for Burry to take long positions in deep-value stocks like he did withGameStopright before the meme stock blasted into orbit in what turned into an epic retail trading frenzy. We really won't know the answer to this question until we see Scion's 13F for the current quarter sometime in July. However, it's quite possible that Burry was only short-term bearish and saw the trade war coming. Burry has done this before. In the second quarter of 2022, right after the Federal Reserve began its intense interest rate hiking campaign, Scion also sold all of its stocks except one. By the third quarter, Scion had begun accumulating stocks again. It would, of course, be quite impressive if Burry sold all of his stocks in the first quarter and then bought the dip after the market sold off intensely right before Trump announced a pause on elevated tariff rates. I wouldn't put it past the legendary investor. Burry could also be more long-term bearish, as he studies economic data closely, which indicates a potential slowdown in consumer spending and the overall economy. I think the big takeaway is that we don't quite know how Burry is positioned for the rest of the year just yet in terms of being bearish or bullish. However, it definitely looks like Burry pulled off another \"big short\" trade.",

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. In a set of recent Bloomberg interviews, the Ark Invest founder said something most investors aren't ready to hear that the biggest gains from artificial intelligence may not come from the companies building the tech, but from the ones quietly using it to rewrite the rules of science. She's talking about drug discovery. Instead of spending years testing combinations in the lab, researchers are now training algorithms to predict what works and they're getting results in weeks. Costs are falling. Timelines are shrinking. And according to Wood, the market hasn't priced in just how big that shift is going to be. It's flying under the radar, according to her. And it's not just AI that's making her bullish. Wood believes the U.S. is entering a more innovation-friendly stretch something she didn't feel under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who she says nearly pushed the crypto industry out of the country. That tide is turning, she says, with digital assets regaining traction and the tech ecosystem breathing a bit easier. Add in the latest round of tariff negotiations which Wood frames as a tax cut in disguise and you've got the makings of a policy backdrop that could supercharge overlooked sectors. This is classic Ark playbook: Go where the long-term story is strong, even if the headlines haven't caught up. In the past, that meant Tesla. Then bitcoin. Now, it might just be AI-fueled healthcare. If Wood's right, the next wave of big winners won't be making chips. They'll be making cures.",

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. NVLink used to be Nvidia-only. Not anymore. Fusion cracks open the ecosystem, making room for third-party processors to plug into Nvidia's platform. Early partners include MediaTek, Marvell Technology (MRVL,Financials), Synopsys (SNPS,Financials), Cadence Design Systems (CDNS,Financials), and Alchip. Customers like Qualcomm (QCOM,Financials) now have more room to mix and match. That flexibility matters. Nvidia already dominates general-purpose AI chips, but rivals like Amazon and Google are pouring money into custom silicon. Analysts say Fusion helps Nvidia stay in the roomeven if it doesn't own all the furniture. There's a tradeoff. Fusion could reduce demand for Nvidia's own CPUs, but makes its GPUs harder to replace in hybrid systems. Broadcom (AVGO,Financials), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD,Financials), and Intel (INTC,Financials) are not part of this first wave. Nvidia also introduced DGX Cloud Lepton, a kind of GPU marketplace to help AI developers find cloud horsepower. And it teased the GB300, its next Grace Blackwell system, coming in Q3 2025.
