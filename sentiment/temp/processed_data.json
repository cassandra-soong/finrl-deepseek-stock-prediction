        "content": "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has surged to its highest point in more than two months, putting it back within reach of the psychological $100,000 level. The digital asset rallied Thursday after reports surfaced that investment bank Morgan Stanley is looking into adding spotcryptocurrency trading to its E*Trade platformsometime next year. Sentiment also received a boost after Strategy (MSTR), the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of bitcoin, said it plans to acquire more bitcoin through a $21 billion equity offering. Bitcoin is up about 30% from its early-April low as investors have sought todiversifytheir portfolios amid uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies and their potential impact on the economy. Amid recent market turmoil, bitcoin and stocks have occasionally moved in opposite directions, evidence to some investors that the cryptocurrency is finally showing its worth as a safe haven.

        "header": "Pay Close Attention to This Crucial Revenue Source for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giant Nvidia",
        "content": "After years ofhigh-flyingsuccess,Nvidia(NVDA2.39%)has hit some turbulencein 2025.The company's stock has declined around 20% year to date, losing nearly $1 trillion in market cap. It's also underperforming the major stock market indexes this year. So where is Nvidia stock headed next, and what key metrics should investors keep a close eye on? Let's dig in and find out. Image source: Getty Images. Over the last three years, Nvidia's revenue has gone through the roof. In its fiscal 2022, the company generated $26.9 billion inrevenue. But its trailing-12-month revenue reached $130.5 billion -- a fivefold increase from just three years ago. The engine behind this growth is Nvidia'sdata centerunit, which generated $115.2 billion, or 88%, of the company's overall revenue in fiscal 2025. The data center unit designs and sellsgraphics processing units (GPUs),which arethe workhorses used in all the critical stages ofartificial intelligence (AI)development: training, inference, and deployment. As AI models like ChatGPT have taken the world by storm, Nvidia has become the world's leading provider of data center GPUs. In fact,according to Motley Fool research, Nvidia now generates about three times as much data center revenue as its three closest competitors --Intel,AdvancedMicroDevices, andIBM-- combined. While Nvidia is miles ahead of the competition now, can its lead endure? Two major worries are hanging over Nvidia right now. One is specific to the AI industry; the other relates to trade policy. First is whether the red-hot growth of AI models and data centers will cool off. There ismajordisagreement on this point.Some analysts point to the emergence of DeepSeek AI as a sign that AI models will become more efficient, thus requiring less computing power and, therefore,fewer GPUs to operate.Still, other analysts believe that more efficient AI models willactuallyincrease the need for GPUs as the barriers to building new models decrease. Whichever side you might be on, one thing is clear: The argument here is whether thegrowth ratein the GPU market slows, not whether the market shrinks. There is awideconsensus that the overall GPU market will continue growing for many yearsto come. The second issue involves trade, specifically between China and the United States. Since governments -- and militaries -- are exploring the potential of AI models, the building blocks of those models (GPUs) have become a national security issue. In particular, the United States has placed export restrictions on some of Nvidia's GPUs -- banning their direct sale to Russia andChina,while limiting the number of GPUs sold to other countries such as Saudi Arabia or India. Ifthe current U.S. export restrictions are furthertightened,orifforeign countries impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. GPUs, Nvidia's data center business could suffer. In short, trade tensions are weighing on Nvidia, even if its fundamentals remain solid. Despite that uncertainty, the stock remains attractive when focusing on said fundamentals. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio stands at 37 as of this writing, not far from the five-year low of 32 it hit in early April. Moreover, just as trade concerns and data center growth fears materialized earlier this year, they could disappear just as quickly. A change in policy from the Trump administration or another AI-related breakthrough could send the broad market -- and Nvidia stock -- back to all-time highs just as quickly as they've pulled back. So, for investors willing to hold Nvidia long term, the stock's recent weakness could prove to be an excellent buying opportunity.",

        "header": "Alphabet Just Delivered Fantastic News for Nvidia Shareholders",
        "content": "Listening to earnings calls from companies you don't invest in but are important overall is a wise idea. Sometimes, you can pick up on information that can affect a company you care about. This happened recently duringAlphabet's(GOOG1.14%)(GOOGL1.48%)conference call, which included key information aboutNvidia(NVDA2.39%). There is a lot of concern about the demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) if the economy starts to slow, but Alphabet seems to be full speed ahead on its data center build-out commitment. This is excellent news for Nvidia, and it could be the very thing it needs to turn its stock around. Nvidia's GPUs are vital to data centers, since they are the computing muscle behind many workloads run on the cloud, including training and running AI models. There is considerable fear about Nvidia's demand potentially declining due to companies reining in their spending, but that doesn't appear to be the case. At the beginning of the year, Alphabet told investors they should expect $75 billion in capital expenditures (capex) for 2025, which is far above and beyond anything that it has spent in the past.  GOOGL Capital Expenditures (TTM)data byYCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months. If Alphabet pulled back on its capex, Nvidia would suffer since it had already planned to meet this capacity. During the Google parent's first-quarter conference call, an analyst specifically asked a question regarding this spending, and chief financial officer Anat Ashkenazi confirmed that it's still on track to do so. Alphabet cannot afford to slow down its buildout because it says that the demand for computing power far exceeds the supply. This is great news for Nvidia -- it's one large client that isn't planning on slowing down purchases of GPUs (among other equipment) because the demand is just too high. Despite this, Nvidia's stock is still well off its all-time highs because many investors fear that its growth will significantly slow down. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't think data center spending will slow down any time soon. In fact, he believes that data center capex will reach $1 trillion by 2030, up from around $400 billion in 2024. Considering that Nvidia generated $115 billion from its data center segment over the past 12 months, it's safe to say that it will capture a large chunk of the overall spending. Should the demand that Alphabet and its peers see continue at an insatiable pace, then Nvidia's stock will continue to be the rocket ship that it was during 2023 and 2024, not the lame duck it has been so far in 2025. Nvidia's stock is down around 20% year to date. However, it's still expected to put up monster growth in fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026), with Wall Street analysts estimating a 54% increase. This projection is what gives Nvidia its attractive price tag today.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts;PE = price to earnings. At24.6 times forward earnings, Nvidia's stock is far cheaper than it has been in the past. However, this price tag also conveys that once this year's growth is up, Nvidia will just be a market-average performer. This doesn't dovetail with where Huang thinks the industry is going or with Alphabet's commentary that there is much larger data center demand than supply. So, if the future holds even more data center demand, then now would appear to be a fantastic time to buy Nvidia shares, as only a single year's worth of growth is priced into the stock. There are few better bargains in the market right now than Nvidia,and it should be at the top of investors' shopping lists, especially before it reports first-quarter earnings sometime in late May.",

        "content": "Nvidiahas been a monster stock, rising 1,480% just in the past five years. But it experienced significant volatility this year. And as of this writing, shares trade down 17% since January 1. The business has become the poster child of theartificial intelligence(AI) boom, providing powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) that help run training and inference models. Revenue and earnings are soaring. However, Nvidia faces risks. Its business could slow dramatically in an economic downturn. Its largest customers are working on their own chips. Competition and supply chain challenges are also things to worry about. Investors might be looking at other options. Is it time to forget about Nvidia and instead buy these two AI stocks right now? When looking at AI stocks to add to your portfolio, it's a smart idea to consider companies that have long dominated the internet economy. I'm talking aboutAlphabet(GOOGL1.48%)(GOOG1.14%)andMeta Platforms(META4.29%). Both businesses just reported Q1 financial results that came in better than expected, showcasing strong momentum. Alphabet owns some of the most popular internet platforms on the face of the planet. For example, streaming service YouTube has an estimated 2.5 billion monthly active users. Meta just revealed that its family of apps had 3.43 billion daily active users in the first quarter. It's hard to believe that this already gargantuan sum is 80 million more than just three months ago. Having massive user bases has given both Alphabet and Meta an edge when it comes to introducing AI products and services. According to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, \"Fifteen of our products with a half-billion users now useGeminimodels.\" AI helps provide thorough responses in Search and traffic info in Maps, for instance. CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, on the other hand, said, \"We're making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1 billion monthly actives.\" The social media juggernaut has plans to launch a separate AI app. These businesses are focused on adding AI functionality for their user bases. However, they haven't forgotten about the key customer group, which is advertisers, offering AI features that can be utilized in their campaigns. Investing in AI infrastructure isn't cheap by any means. This highlights just how critical it is to have access to capital for those enterprises that want to stay ahead of the curve. Here's where these two companies truly shine.Alphabet and Meta raked in $16.6 billion and $34.5 billion in net income, respectively, in the first quarter. Their profit margins are incredible. And if we look at these businesses' balance sheets together, they have a combined $125.8 billion in net cash (cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, minus long-term debt). In other words, there are essentially unlimited financial resources that these companies can tap. Alphabet plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, while Meta just upped its target to a range between $64 billion and $72 billion. Critics will argue that the potential financial return of all this spending is uncertain. However, it's worth taking the risk to ensure they have a chance to become the AI leaders of tomorrow. The uncertain economic environment is having a negative impact on investor confidence. Risk-averse market participants might believe it's time to be a bit more cautious. But here's where the opportunity lies. Shares of these great businesses can be purchased at more attractive valuations. Alphabet trades at aforward P/E ratioof 17, below Meta's 22 multiple. It's not every day that their stock prices are off more than 20% from their peaks. Therefore, to gain AI exposure, investors might want to take a closer look at these tech giants.",

        "header": "Did Huawei Just Say \"Checkmate\" to Nvidia?",
        "content": "Privately held Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei is reportedly building a new chip to rivalNvidia(NVDA2.39%), which has long been considered the world's dominant artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker. However, export regulations dating back to 2022 have gradually curbed Nvidia's ability to sell its products to Chinese companies. Recently, the Trump administration informed Nvidia that it would need an export license to continue sending the chips it had been selling to China, effectively introducing another big road block for Nvidia in the Chinese market. Nvidia will take a big charge in the quarter due to the license requirements and, in the near term, doing business in China is going to be a significant challenge, potentially presenting an opportunity for a domestic Chinese company to fill the void. Did Huawei just say \"checkmate\" to Nvidia? The Wall Street Journalreported that Huawei is working on a product called the 910D chip, which the company is still testing. Huawei is supposedly preparing to send the chips out to several Chinese companies later this month. The chip is intended to rival Nvidia's H100 Hopper chip, which is not the most advanced Nvidia chip, but certainly one of the more recent iterations. Hopper offers features such as faster AI training, real-time deep learning inference, high-performance computing, and accelerated data analytics. Due toexport restrictionsthat began during the Biden administration and continued to escalate in the Trump administration, Nvidia built a modified H100 chip called H20, which was less powerful than the H100 chips and specifically built to comply with export restrictions so it could be sold in China. Both the current and recent administrations have been concerned about how China might use the AI chips. But despite efforts to stymie China's AI capabilities, the Chinese company DeepSeek developed a chatbot with similar capabilities to OpenAI's ChatGPT, supposedly using Nvidia's H800 chips. The H800 chips were one of the earlier chips Nvidia created to comply with some of the first Chinese export restrictions before those got banned due to new export restrictions. The H800 has more computing power than the H20, but less than the H100.  So, if Huawei's 910D can truly rival Nvidia's H100 chip, that would give Chinese companies access to more powerful chips than they have been buying from Nvidia in recent years. Right now, it doesn't seem like Huawei can compete with Nvidia's offerings. That doesn't mean ChineseAI companieslike DeepSeek won't find ways to innovate with less, but Huawei's 910D chips will be hard-pressed to compete with the H100. TheJournalreported that the 910D chips use more power and are less efficient than the H100 chips. Richard Windsor, the founder of the research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a research note that Huawei's chips are likely to stay limited in size to 7 nanometers. The trend in chips is to go smaller because smaller chips use less power, have better performance, and can pack more transistors onto a smaller surface area, typically leading to more processing power. Nvidia's H100 chip is only 4 nanometers. \"The net result is that I don't think that Huawei is going to be competing directly with Nvidia, and so concerns over substantial market-share loss are overblown, in my opinion,\" Windsor wrote. Finally, the H100 is now considered an old model for Nvidia. The company already released its next-generation Blackwell chips, reporting overwhelming demand for the product earlier this year. Additionally, Nvidia is already planning to release new chip models in 2026 and 2028. So, I don't think Huawei's new chip is checkmate for Nvidia. However, Huawei will have increased opportunities in China as long as these export restrictions stay in place, and China is a huge market for any tech or AI company.",

        "header": "Netflix Stock Just Notched a New All-Time High. Is This a Brilliant \"Recession-Proof\" Stock Pick?",
        "content": "While most of the tech sector is off its all-time highs by 20% or so,Netflix(NFLX0.13%)recently notched a new all-time high. Most of the market fears how trade wars and tariffs could affect the economy, but Netflix seems immune to those fears. One conclusion could explain Netflix stock's resilience: The market seems to think it's recession-proof. So, is this the case? And if it is, does the stock have more room to run? Let's take a look. Netflix isn't a company that needs an introduction. Nearly everyone (or seemingly everyone) has a Netflix account or has access to one, although the latter has become a bit rarer due to the password sharing crackdown. Even if a person doesn't have access to it at the moment, it's a subscription service that many people come back to once a new show arrives or a hit series debuts. Even though Netflix hiked its prices, it still offers great value for its content. You can get access to thousands of titles every month for less than the price of a family dinner. That's a pretty compelling offer, and it could make Netflix a resilient company if consumers' resources start to get stretched thin. This could give it the \"recession-proof\" moniker, which is a title rarely bestowed upon companies. But after it recently notched a new all-time high, is now the time to buy some shares? Netflix's market cap is around $481 billion. However, according to co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Netflix's internal goal is to reach a $1 trillion valuation by 2030. That would indicate the stock will double in under six years, which would make it well worth owning. But is that realistic? It should be noted that Sarandos also set the goal of the company's revenue doubling by 2030, so at least some financial results are tied to the valuation. Otherwise, it would just be a baseless prediction. The problem is that Netflix already has an ultra-premium valuation that could hinder this goal. After its most recent all-time high, Netflix trades for a pricey52.5 times earningsand43 times forward earnings.  NFLX PE Ratiodata byYCharts.PE = price-to-earnings. While some of Netflix's big tech peers used to have valuations like that, most sold off due to economic fears. Additionally, those same companies are expected to grow similarly to or faster than Netflix's pace over the next few years. Here's how Netflix stacks up to some of those companies: Data source: YCharts and Yahoo! Finance. Note: Projected revenue growth is from Wall Street analysts. Nvidia's projections are for FY 2026 and FY 2027. Although it's expected to grow similarly toAlphabetandMeta Platforms, its stock has around double the premium these two do. Even a high-growth competitor likeNvidiais valued at far less than Netflix, which leads me to assume that there's a ton of growth already baked into Netflix's stock price. At 43 times forward earnings, Netflix's stock is just too expensive to make a solid profit. While it may succeed in the coming years, the values that other stocks provide are far greater. As a result, investors should consider scooping up shares of some of Netflix's big tech peers while they're on sale, rather than buying Netflix itself. The time has come and gone to buy Netflix shares;it's time to look elsewhere.",

Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher as investors react to China's announcement it was prepared to negotiate with the U.S. on tariffs.S&P 500andDow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are rising by about 0.4% after the indexesnotched their eighth straight positive sessionsyesterday.Nasdaqfutures were higher by 0.2% after the tech-heavy index added 1.5% in the prior session. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is gaining to trade at around $97,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are little changed. Gold futures are moving higher while oil futures are dipping. China said it is \"currently evaluating\"U.S. proposals to start trade talks, opening the door to negotiations between Beijing and Washington for the first time since tariffs between the two began escalating.China imposed125%in tariffs on U.S. goods in retaliation for President Donald Trump's 145% import duties on Chinese products. The U.S. presidentrecently saidthat tariffs on China \"will come down substantially, but it won't be zero.\" Trump has repeatedly said that Beijing has approached the U.S. to begin talks, which China has denied. Apple (AAPL) shares are more than 3% lower in premarket trading after CEO Tim Cook said that Trump'stariff policies could cost the company $900 millionin the current quarter. Cook made the comments after the iPhone maker reported a5% year-over-year revenue rise to $95.4 billionand profit of $1.65 per share, both topping Visible Alpha estimates. Apple makes approximately 90% of its products in China, and while most Apple products areexemptfrom President Trump's 125%\"reciprocal\" tariffson Chinese goods, Cook said the iPhone maker was still affected by the 20% import tax the White House\u00a0put in place earlier in the year to combat fentanyl trafficking. Amazon (AMZN) shares are edging lower in premarket trading, paring overnight declines, after thee-commerce giant delivered profit projectionsfor the current quarter that came in below estimates. Amazon reported first-quarter results that topped Visible Alpha expectations, with revenue jumping 9% year-over-year to $155.7 billion and net income of $1.59 per share. However, Amazon's projected Q2 operating income of $13 billion to $17.5 billion was largely below the analyst consensus. Shares of Reddit (RDDT) are jumping nearly 7% in premarket trading after the social media companyreported a big jump in first-quarter revenue. Reddit posted sales that rose by more than 60% to above $392 million and easily outstripped the Visible Alpha consensus estimate, while net income also came in ahead of expectations. The company also issued second-quarter revenue guidance that, at its $420 million midpoint, was well above the $394 million consensus.",

        "content": "I'm not here to blow your mind. This is just a quick reality check. Quantum computing pioneerIonQ(IONQ-0.47%)soared in 2024. The stock price rose from less than $7 to more than $51 in four short months, as investors caught wind of game-changing advances in the quantum computing market. The enthusiasm died down in January 2025, when a leading industry insider pointed out that really useful quantum computers are about 20 years away. So here's the thing. IonQ is an early leader inthe quantum computing field. However, its business operations are minimal so far, and the long-term future is full of risks. This company just might become a massive powerhouse someday, but it's a long shot. Meanwhile, much larger and financially stable companies are even more important quantum computing experts today. They will probably stay far ahead of pure-play specialists in the long run. The stock is also incredibly overvalued in 2025. In other words, you should treat IonQ as a speculative long-term bet. Everythingcouldwork out just right and make IonQ investors rich, butthe opposite outcome seems more likely. You will probably be happier in the long run if you invest in the really big names of the quantum computing market. Again, I'm not trying to blow your mind.Alphabet(GOOG1.14%)(GOOGL1.48%),IBM(IBM-0.99%), andNvidia(NVDA2.39%)will be worth much more than IonQ in 2035 -- just like they are today. You may not have noticed that these are the biggest names in quantum computing. Let me sketch their expertise real quick: Chasing after hot names like IonQ can be exciting, but you already know where I'm going with this -- investing is a marathon, not a sprint. That's true even in fast-moving technology markets such as the fledgling quantum computing industry. IonQ could be a big winner in the long haul, but the three tech giants are so far ahead, it's not even funny. They are also better equipped to handle a few failed research projects and dead-end developments, which I'm sure you'll see a lot of over the years. Meanwhile,Nvidia investors tap into the artificial intelligence boom. Alphabet owners are also connected to that opportunity, not to mention the company's dominantdigital marketingoperations. IBM has been around for a century and change, and should stay relevant for a long time with its broad and deep portfolio of technology services. IBM, Nvidia, and Alphabet are worth a lot more than IonQ today, and that shouldn't change in the next decade. That shouldn't be a controversial forecast.",

The company's share price was down 10.3% from last week's market close heading into the start of trading this Friday. Across the same period, theS&P 500was up 1.4%. After the market closed on Tuesday, Supermicro published preliminary results for the third quarter of its 2025 fiscal year -- which ended March 31. The company issued substantial downward performance revisions, and investors sold out of the stock in response. Supermicro is scheduled to report its fiscal Q3 results after the market closes on May 6, but the company updated investors on what to expect earlier this week. It now expects revenue to come in between $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion. Previously, the company had guided for sales to be between $5 billion and $6 billion in the period. Management also now expectsnon-GAAP(adjusted) earnings per share for the period to be between $0.29 and $0.31 -- down from its previous guidance for earnings per share between $0.46 and $0.62. Supermicro's Q3 guidance update this week raised questions about whether demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers is weakening. On the other hand, the company attributed its big downward guidance revisions to customer orders being pushed further out. Shipment delays for theNvidiaBlackwell processors that are at the heart of Supermicro's newest servers may have played a major role in the disappointing Q3 guidance. Strong quarterly reports and capital expenditures updates fromMicrosoftandMeta Platformsearlier this week suggest that AI infrastructure spending remains high, and it's possible that Supermicro will wind up seeing very strong sales in the current quarter following delayed orders in Q3. Investors should get a closer look at the outlook when the company publishes its fiscal Q3 results next week.",

Earlier this month, Berkshire issued a statement dismissing comments allegedly made by Buffett on social media following speculation he had endorsed Trump\u2019s tariffs, and the legendary investor toldCNBChe wouldn\u2019t comment further on the economy or markets until Berkshire\u2019s meeting. That\u2019s after Buffett in Marchcalled tariffs an \"act of war\"in a televised interview withCBS News. \"Over time, they're a tax on goods,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay 'em! And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'\" While theS&P 500is down about 4% year-to-date amid heightened market volatility, Berkshire\u2019s shares have added close to 19%.

CFRA also pointed to Buffett's age, at 94, as a risk factor. While Berkshire has not formally announced a successor yet, Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders in February that \"it won\u2019t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO.\" Investors will also focus their attention on Berkshire\u2019s cash pile, which swelled to arecord $334.2 billionat the end of 2024, and how Buffett might deploy it\u2014or keep adding to it. Buffett said last year that \u201cthings aren\u2019t attractive,\u201d with a dearth of options that would satisfy Berkshire\u2019s criteria. In the fourth quarter, Berkshire hadentered a new positionin Modelo maker Constellation Brands (STZ), while raising its stakes in SiriusXM (SIRI), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Verisign (VRSN), and Pool Corp.

        "content": "Shares ofCoreWeave(CRWV16.81%)had a volatile April along with much of the stock market, but the recent IPO ended up with positive gains after a lackluster debut at the end of March. There wasn't much news out on CoreWeave in April, as investors await its first earnings report as a public company on May 14, but the stock proved to be highly sensitive to news from the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, swinging multiple times on news from peer stocks, and due to macro news. Despite a broader pullback in the stock market last month, CoreWeave finished April up 11%, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence. As you can see from the chart, the stock soared early in the month on news from the start-up world, and then fell on broader concerns about tariffs and the economy, though it retained enough of those gains to finish in positive territory.  CRWVdata byYCharts CoreWeave went public on March 28, and had two lackluster trading days before soaring on April 1 and April 2, gaining 66% over a two-day span on news that OpenAI had closed its latest funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion. OpenAI raised $40 billion from investors includingMicrosoftandSoftBank, and the news helped shore up concerns that AI infrastructure demand was slowing. AI infrastructure is CoreWeave's business, as the company provides generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure to companies like Microsoft,Nvidia, and OpenAI. Early in the month, reports also came out thatAlphabet's Google was in talks to rent AI servers from CoreWeave, a positive sign. However, the stock quickly gave up some of those gains in response to the announcement of President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, and continued to drift lower in response to concerns about an economic slowdown. The stock hit bottom on April 21, and then started to recover on a broader upturn in the market on hopes that U.S.-China trade tensions would ease, and as analyst ratings started rolling in for CoreWeave after the quiet period ended. CoreWeave received a mix of buy and neutral ratings from analysts, as Wall Street noted the uniqueness of the company and the difficulty of predicting the future of the fast-growing, loss-generating company in a critical market but a volatile economic environment. Image source: Getty Images. All eyes will be on the company's first earnings report on May 14, and investors should expect a double-digit swing from the stock, depending on how it performs. Analysts are expecting revenue of $859.9 million, representing 356% year-over-year growth and 15% sequential growth. Keep an eye on that number when the Q1 results come out, as that will likely determine the stock move.",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) wavered between gains and losses Friday after the e-commerce and cloud computing giantissued a cautious outlookamid uncertainty about the economy, offsetting strong quarterly results. During the company\u2019searnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts the company hasn\u2019t seen any significant impact fromtariffsdenting consumer demand or sellers setting product pricing, but cautioned that may change.He also said that Amazon has remained proactive to keep prices low. Amazon shares had lost 13% since the start of the year through Thursday's close and dropped 22% from their record high established in early February, weighed down by concerns that the company could get caught in the crosshairs of a protractedU.S.- China trade war. The stock was up about 1% at $192 in early-afternoon trading Friday, recovering from losses earlier in the session. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Amazon\u2019s chart and point out key post-earnings price levels worth monitoring. Since bottoming out last month, Amazon shares have consolidated within arising wedge. More recently, the price has rallied toward the wedge\u2019s top trendline and50-day moving average (MA), a move that has coincided with therelative strength index (RSI)crossing back into bullish territory. Let\u2019s identify several keysupport and resistancelevels on Amazon\u2019s chart that will likely gain investors\u2019 attention. A decisivebreakdownbelow the rising wedge pattern's lower trendline could see the shares drop to around $170. This area on the chart would likely provide support near the late-April low and the trough of a minorpullbackto the 200-day MA last August. Selling below this level brings lower support at $152 into play. Bargain hunters could seek buying opportunities at a location near last year\u2019s early Augustsell-offlow. This region also roughly aligns with a projected bars pattern downside target that extracts the trend lower that preceded the rising wedge and repositions it from the pattern\u2019s top trendline, speculating where the shares may be headed if a continuation move lower plays out. A breakout above the rising wedge pattern\u2019s top trendline would likely see the stock test overhead resistance near $199. The shares may run into selling pressure in this area near ahorizontal linethat connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart extending back to early July last year. Finally, a morebullishmove higher in Amazon shares could propel a move up to $216. Investors who bought at lower levels may see this as high probability area to place sell orders near the stock\u2019s Novemberpeakand January trough.

After the bell Thursday, Duolingo reported earnings per share of $0.72 on revenue that soared 38% year-over-year to $230.7 million, both topping Visible Alpha consensus estimates. The company saw a 40% jump in paid subscribers to 10.3 million and a nearly 50% annual jump to 46.6 million daily active users (DAUs). Both metrics also topped projections. Duolingo also lifted its full-year revenue projections to a range of $987 million to $996 million, up from the previous range of $962.5 million to $978.5 million. Duolingo shares were up 19% to more than $477 in recent trading, and set an intraday record of $480 earlier in the session. In a note following Thursday's report, JPMorgan analysts maintained their \"overweight\" rating and lifted their price target to $500 from $360, above the Visible Alpha consensus of roughly $446. The analysts said they see room for Duolingo's DAUs to continue growing from a wider adoption of its English lessons, and its non-language-focused material like a chess course, which Duolingo is expected to launch in the coming weeks. The analysts also said Duolingo's recently announced effort to more than double its language library with 148 new language courses, with an increasing amount of educational content created by generative AI, \"will support strong user & paid subscriber growth.\"",

        "header": "Worried About Tariffs and a Recession? Here's What Retirees Need to Know",
        "content": "Trade tensions are stirring up fresh concerns for retirees. While economic uncertainty isn't new, this round of volatility is being driven more by policy changes than typical business cycles. As a result, you might be wondering how to best protect yourretirement savings. Financial experts stress that most retirees should stay focused on a long-term strategy. That includes reviewingwithdrawal plans, building flexibility into spending, and maintaining realistic expectations about market ups and downs. While tariffs and inflation may rattle the markets, most retirees don\u2019t need to change their withdrawal plans immediately. Kevin Jestice, CFA, CIPM, and Head ofNationwide\u2019s Investment Management Group, said this is not the time for rash decisions. \u201cVolatile times like this...are really good times to engage in a conversation with theirfinancial advisorabout whether their needs and circumstances have changed,\u201d he said. For retirees already drawing down their savings, maintaining flexibility around discretionary spending can help reduce the need tosell investments in a downturn. If you can afford to delay some purchases or scale back temporarily, you may avoid locking in losses. On the flip side, market dips may offer a chance to buy at lower prices for those still contributing to their retirement accounts. But, as Jestice put it, \u201cStocks are one of the few things people don\u2019t like to buy at a discount,\u201d even though they can represent good value during periods ofmarket stress. Short-term volatility, even when sparked by trade policy or interest rate fears, doesn\u2019t justify a major portfolio overhaul for most retirees. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t recommend a significant asset allocation change as a result of a short-term phenomenon,\u201d said Jestice, noting that many Americans now need their retirement savings to last multiple decades. People retiring at 65 today may spend 20 to 30 years or more in retirement, which means their investments must continue working long after their final paycheck.In fact, Jestice noted a growing trend toward slightly higher equity allocations among older investors compared to previous generations, reflecting longer life expectancies and the need for continued growth. Some retirees also turn to products offering income guarantees, such asannuities, to help buffer against market swings. While these tools aren\u2019t right for everyone, they can help reduce volatility and provide morepredictable incomein uncertain times. As Jestice explained, these guarantees \u201cchange the risk-return profile of the total portfolio\u201d and are increasingly seen as a complement to traditional allocations. Maintaining some cash on hand is important for covering unexpected expenses, especially in retirement. But too muchliquiditycan hinder long-term growth. According to Jestice, retirees shouldn\u2019t pivot in and out of cash in reaction to market headlines. \u201cStick with the plan that\u2019s designed around your savings goals and time horizon,\u201d he advised. While a modestcash buffercan provide peace of mind and short-term flexibility, holding large amounts on the sidelines can mean missing out on growth opportunities. Especially during volatile periods, staying invested is often the better long-term move. Investors who maintain their original asset allocation strategy are typicallybetter positioned to benefitfrom eventual market recoveries. Retirees face the greatest risk when markets dip early in retirement\u2014a concept known assequence of returns risk. Market losses in those first few years can have a large impact on long-term portfolio health. That\u2019s why spending flexibility becomes such a powerful tool. Here\u2019s how retirees can protect their savings during turbulent times: Even small spending adjustments in response to market conditions can help yourinvestmentsrecover and last longer. If you can cut back on spending during a market downturn, even temporarily, you may avoid locking in losses by selling investments at a low point. Small adjustments can make a big difference over time. Whiletariffshave been front and center in recent headlines, they\u2019re just one of several economic signals experts are watching closely. Jestice emphasized that tariffs may not directly impact individual retirees, but the ripple effects can createmarket swingsthat affect everyone\u2019s portfolio. Other key indicators include the shape of theyield curve, which helps signal investors' expectations about future interest rates and recession risk, and ongoing trends in inflation.Persistent inflationcan be especially harmful for retirees on fixed incomes, erodingpurchasing powerover time.Corporate earningsare also under the microscope, as their strength or weakness can indicate how resilient the broader economy might be in the face of policy shifts or global uncertainty. Together, these signals help financial professionals gauge where the economy may be headed and how retirees should position themselves for the months ahead. If you're retired orapproaching retirement, headlines about tariffs and economic volatility can be unsettling. But the fundamentals still apply: stick with your long-term plan, explore options for guaranteed income if appropriate, and be willing to adjust spending if needed. Take advantage of anyfinancial education toolsavailable through yourretirement planor provider, even if you don\u2019t work with a financial advisor. And remember, your time horizon is probably longer than you think. As Jestice put it, \u201cThere\u2019s no better time to begin investing in a retirement plan than the present, regardless of the market volatility.\u201d",

Friday's rally also erased all of the S&P 500's post-\"Liberation Day\" losses. The index, which in mid-April was down more than 15% from the start of the year, is now down less than 4% year-to-date. Investors have slowly regained their appetite for risk after President Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement in early April prompted one ofthe worst stock sell-offsin decades. A slew of solid earnings reports and hope for tariff relief have helped the S&P 500 rise nearly 8.7% in the last eight sessions, its biggest rally of that length since November 2020 when stocks were buoyed by the completion of Covid-19 vaccines.

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher on the final day of the trading week. The latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the economy addedmore jobs than expected in April. The strong pace of hiring suggests that the labor market remains resilient despite uncertainties related to tariffs and trade policies. The S&P 500 jumped 1.5%, marking its ninth straight winning session. The Nasdaq also added 1.5%, while the Dow ended 1.4% higher. DexCom (DXCM) shares surged 16.2%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the maker of glucose monitoring devices for patients with diabetestopped first-quarter revenue estimates. Although profits came in slightly below expectations and the company said that incremental costs could pressure its 2025 gross profit margins, DexCom highlighted strong demand and announced a $750 million stock buyback program. The strong jobs report, which helped alleviate concerns about the potential for a sustained economic downturn driven by trade tensions, helped boost the outlook for U.S. travel demand. Shares of numerous companies in the travel industry moved higher. United Airlines Holdings (UAL) shares lifted 7.1%, while Delta Air Lines (DAL)\u00a0shares advanced 6.6%. Shares of cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) were up 6.8%. Franklin Resources (BEN) stock added 7.2% following the investment management holding company's quarterly earnings report. While profits came in below estimates, they grew on a year-over-year basis, and revenue in the period exceeded forecasts. Franklin also touted strong inflows for its exchange-traded fund (ETF) business, which achieved a record high in assets under management (AUM). Although internet domain and web hosting provider GoDaddy (GDDY) exceeded earnings per share (EPS) and revenue expectations for the first quarter of 2025, analysts at RBC and Barclays reduced their price target on the stock, citing valuation concerns. GoDaddy shares slipped 8.4% on Friday, suffering the heaviest decline in the S&P 500. Shares of public safety, enterprise security, and critical communications company Motorola Solutions (MSI) sank 7.5%. Although the provider of land mobile radio and video security systems exceeded first-quarter sales and profit expectations, it provided relatively muted guidance for sales growth in the second quarter. The company also indicated that potential tariffs could generate cost pressure throughout 2025. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) shares fell 6.7% after the video game maker's subsidiary Rockstar Games announced that the release of its highly anticipatedGrand Theft Auto VItitle would be delayed until May 2026. However, Take-Two indicated that despite the postponed launch, it still anticipates record net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027.",

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. In today's climate ofeconomic uncertainty, triggered by President Trump's evolvingtariffpolicy, parking cash in reserve feels prudent. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or shifting funds from riskier investments, it's important to consider how much you can earn from different cash strategies. Fortunately, the options are excellent right now, as returns continue to be buoyed by theFederal Reserve'sbenchmark interest rateremaining high. Not only that, but it appears likely the central bank will keep its federal funds rate where it is for two more meetings. According to theCME Group's FedWatch Tool, financial markets are currently pricing in 66% odds that the first 2025 rate cut won't come before the Fed's July 30 rate announcement. That would be good news for savers, as the rates that banks, credit unions, and brokerages are willing to pay on your savings are directly impacted by thefederal funds rate. Anytime the Fed cuts that benchmark rate, rates for savings, money market, and CD accounts fall as well. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, indicating the change from a week ago. The rates below are the top nationally available APYs from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. Note that savings and money market account rates are variable, meaning the bank is free to lower them at any time. In contrast, CD rates are locked and guaranteed for the certificate's full term. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed but can change at any time. Treasury securities pay their rate through maturity and can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect, or can be bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage. I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirect and can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account\u2014sometimes called ahigh-yield savings account\u2014that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives youalmost 20 options paying 4.35% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type\u2014money market or savings\u2014pays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.40% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includesoptions paying up to 4.50% APY. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.98% to 4.23% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds \"swept\" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20 or 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.82% to 4.81%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsdirectly fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect\u2014the U.S. Treasury\u2019s online platform for buying federal government securities\u2014has no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. Every six months you own the bond, your rate will change. I bond rates just went up on May 1, from 3.11% for bonds issued during the last six months to 3.98% for new bonds purchased from May 1 to Oct. 31, 2025. ForexistingI bond holders, your next six-month rate will also increase\u2014by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe recent rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

The S&P 500's tech sector index climbed 1% Friday to log a nearly 4% weekly gain after some of America's biggest tech companies reported better-than-expected earnings.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) shares slid Friday amid worries about tariffs after CEO Tim Cook warned they could cost the company$900 millionthis quarter. Shares of Apple dropped nearly 4% to close just above $205. The stock has lost close to a fifth of its value so far this year. \u201cThe elephant in the room continues to be the tariff tornado with Apple and Cook caught in the eye of the storm,\u201d Wedbush analysts said after the company released itsfiscal second-quarter earnings, which topped analysts' estimates.Still, the analysts remain bullish on the stock and raised their price target to $270 from $250, based in part on Cook\u2019s assertion during Apple\u2019s earnings call that most iPhones sold in the U.S. this quarter will comefrom India, rather than China. Cook\u2019s comments come amid concerns Apple could be particularly hurt by trade tensions with China, where Apple manufactured an estimated 90% of its products until recently. Most Apple products areexemptfrom President Trump's 125%\"reciprocal\" tariffson Chinese goods, but still affected by the 20% import tax the White House put in place earlier in the year to combat fentanyl trafficking, Cook noted during Thursday's call. JPMorgan analysts on Friday cut their price target for Apple to $240 from $250, and Bank of America moved to $235 from $240.JPMorgan warned Apple may be able to get ahead of the impact of tariffs by building up inventory, but that benefit will fade the longer the levies are in place.

        "header": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Intel",
        "content": "When it comes to investing in artificial intelligence (AI), buying shares ofgraphics processing unit (GPU)manufacturers likeNvidia(NVDA2.33%)andIntel(INTC3.00%)can be a wise decision. Nearly every AI application requires these specialized chips to function, and buying stock in a GPU maker gives your portfolio direct exposure to the entire AI industry. Right now, Nvidia shares give you more-direct exposure to AI demand, but Intel's discounted valuation and plans for growth make it an exciting story to watch. So which GPU manufacturer should you invest in today? You might be surprised by the answer. Most of Nvidia's gargantuan $3 trillion market cap can be attributed to its dominance in AI chips. Estimates say the company commands somewhere between 70% to 95% market share for GPUs designed for the AI market. This dominance was created over more than a decade of forward thinking. In 2006, for instance, Nvidia released its CUDA developer suite, which allowed developers to customize its chips to create unparalleled performance benefits. This customization also locked customers into Nvidia's hardware and has a flywheel effect for its software. The company was also one of the first to ramp up investment in machine-learning GPUs, giving it a crucial head start over the competition. Intel, meanwhile, has been left in the dust due to a variety of management errors. Today, its revenue is shrinking, with its valuation more than 90% below Nvidia's on a price-to-sales basis. Even management isn't confident that it can catch up to Nvidia anytime soon. Patrick Gelsinger, Intel's former CEO, recently said about Nvidia: \"In that race, they are so far ahead. Given the other challenges that we have, we're just not going to be competing anytime soon.\" So when it comes to betting on AI, Nvidia is the clear winner right now. But might Intel shares be a worthwhile investment given their rock bottom valuation?  NVDA PS Ratiodata byYCharts; PS = price to sales, TTM = trailing 12 months. Right now, Nvidia is selling tens of billions of dollars worth of AI accelerators each quarter.Advanced Micro Devices, a rival, is selling more than $1 billion worth each quarter. What about Intel? In 2024, it failed to reach its target of just $500 million in AI GPU sales for the entire year. Intel's competitiveness in AI right now simply cannot be undersold. But is the valuation low enough to warrant a small stake? I'd argue yes for one reason:gross margins.  NVDA Gross Profit Margindata byYCharts. Due to heavy demand, many of Nvidia's chips are seeing waiting times of 12 months or more. Its products are priced at a steep premium to the competition, and rightfully so. Its gross margins are nearly 75%, while Intel's gross margins are closer to 30%. This is where Intel can compete. If demand for AI chips continues to outpace Nvidia's ability to meet that demand, it's possible that Intel can convince developers and data center operators to switch to its inferior product due to cheaper pricing and its availability. This adoption could help build out Intel's developer ecosystem, a major weakness in its current product. If you want to invest in AI, Nvidia should be a heavy position in your portfolio. But adding a small position in Intel could help diversify that bet for a very small price, allowing you to benefit wherever shares trend toward over time.",

UBS analysts, however, reduced their bullish target to $249 from $253. Amazon shares were little changed Friday, edging 0.1% lower to close at about $190. The stock has lost roughly 13% since the start of the year. Amazon executives said in Thursday's earnings call that the company has not yet seen any weakness in online shopping, and if anything they have seen increased levels of buying as consumers look to get ahead of the impact of tariffs. \"While we hesitate to call this earnings report an inflection point as we are still in the dark about further tariff/policy moves, we believe we are seeing a tactical buy signal for AMZN shares,\" UBS analysts wrote. Wedbush analysts said Amazon has \"multiple levers of sustainable margin improvement,\" including increasing optimization and automation in its retail supply chain. All four analysts said that the company's Amazon Web Services platform could see strong growth in the second half of this year as it increases compute capacity, as Amazon has said its AWS sales have been limited by supply so far this year.
