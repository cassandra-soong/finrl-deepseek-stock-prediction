        "content": "Palantir Technologies(PLTR) raised its full-year outlook but disappointed investors withmostly in-line quarterly results, sending shares in the analytics software provider sharply lower in extended trading on Monday. The company reported first-quarter revenue of $884 million, up 39% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus. Adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents, rose from 8 cents per share a year earlier, in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\u00a0Investors may have been looking for more, after the AI darling posted blowout results inFebruaryandNovember. Ahead of today\u2019s highly anticipated earnings report, Palantir shares were up 64% since the start of the year and had soared more than five-fold over the past 12 months. The stock has been boosted by optimism that the software maker would benefit from increasing enterprise AI deployments and federal initiatives to improve government efficiency. The stock fell more than 9% to $112.32 in after-hours trading. Below, we take a closer look at Palantir\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. After setting their record high in mid-February, Palantir shares consolidated within afalling wedgebefore breaking out above the pattern last month. More recently, the stock has rallied to its highest level since mid-February but found significant selling pressure around its record high as therelative strength index (RSI)crossed into overbought territory. Indeed, the stock looks set to continue its retreat from this importanttechnicallocation on Tuesday, possibly forming adouble toppattern in the process. Let\u2019s identify three majorsupport levelson Palantir\u2019s chart worth watching and also locate a key overhead area to monitor during potential upswings. Amid earnings-driven selling, it's initially worth watching the $97 level. This area on the chart, currently positioned slightly above the50-day moving average, could attract buying interest near a brief period of consolidation following the initialbreakoutfrom the falling wedge pattern and the late-Marchcountertrendhigh. A decisive close below this level could see the shares fall to around $83. Investors may seekentry pointsat this location near a trendline that connects last year\u2019s prominent December peak and a brief period ofsideways driftthat preceded the stock\u2019s early-Februarybreakaway gap. A more significantretracementopens the door for selling down to the $66 level. The shares would likely attract support in this region on the chart near the closely watched200-day moving averageand last month\u2019sswing low, which also closely aligns with the January trough and a minor peak in mid November. Finally, during upswings in Palantir shares, investors should monitor key overheadresistancearound $125. This level, currently situated just above Monday's close, will likely attract significant attention near the May high and the prominent February peak, which also marks the stock\u2019s record high.

        "header": "2 Colossal Dow Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in May, and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "For the last 129 years, the iconicDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI-0.24%)has served as Wall Street's most front-and-center health barometer. When the Dow was incepted in the late 19th century, it was composed of one dozen (mostly) industrial companies. Over time, it's evolved into the ageless index we see today, which is made up of 30 highly diverse, time-tested, multinational businesses. Although theDow Jones Industrial Averagehas historically risen over long periods, it doesn't mean every component is necessarily worth buying. As we power ahead into the heart of earnings season in May, two colossal Dow stocks have checked all the right boxes for investors, while another is throwing up no shortage of red flags. Image source: Getty Images. The Dow component I'd argue has thehighest-conviction upside over the next five yearsis payment-processing titanVisa(V0.35%). Visa is a cyclical business, and there have been concerns about the growing possibility of the U.S. economy weakening or dipping into a recession. The initial first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) report showed the U.S. economy contracted by 0.3%. When the U.S. economy is shrinking, the expectation is that consumers and businesses will spend less. A weaker spending environment isn't good news for a company like Visa that generates fees from payment-based transactions. Butcyclicality works in both directions. Even though recessions are an inevitable aspect of economic cycles, they're historically quick to resolve. Since the end of World War II, a dozen U.S. recessions have occurred. Whereas the average recession has resolved in roughly 10 months, the typical economic expansion has lasted for around five years. Visa disproportionately benefits from lengthy periods of economic growth. It's also acompany that has a lengthy growth runway ahead of it. In Visa's fiscal second quarter (ended March 31), it announced cross-border payment volume growth of 13%. Visa has been consistently delivering double-digit growth in cross-border payment volume, which speaks to its largely untapped opportunity in emerging markets. Something else smart investors are going to note about Visa is that its management team has avoided dipping the company's proverbial toes into lending. By acting only as a payment facilitator, Visa avoids the need to set aside capital to cover potential loan losses and credit delinquencies. In short, it can bounce back from periods of economic turbulence much faster than other financial institutions. Though Visa stock hasn't pulled back significantly during the current correction for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it's still a bargain. Itsforward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof roughly 27 sits 6% below its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last half-decade. Image source: Getty Images. A second colossal Dow stock that long-term investors can add to their portfolios with confidence in May is health insurance and services giantUnitedHealth Group(UNH1.22%). On April 17, UnitedHealth stock produced its worst single-session performance of the century, with a loss of 22%. The company reduced its full-year profit guidance and pointed to unanticipated increases in Medicare Advantage costs, including outpatient services, for its surprising and disappointing forecast. While it may take a few quarters before UnitedHealth's operating performance fully stabilizes, there are a few core catalysts here that remain undisturbed, despite its poor recent operating results. Health insurancemay be a boring business, but it's one that tends to generate consistent profits and leads to modest growth. Every so often, one or more insurers will contend with a catastrophe event or unexpected cost issues that weigh on results. However, the wider-lens view shows that insurers possess significant premium pricing power. They're able to use these events as justification to increase premiums to cover their higher outlays. Higher medical costs are rarely, if ever, a prolonged issue for health insurers. It's also a predictable operating model. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing, demand for medical services remains fairly constant. More often than not, UnitedHealth's management team is going to be able to accurately forecast its expenses. However,UnitedHealth Group's crown jewel is its Optum subsidiary, which provides everything from pharmacy benefit services to software and data analytics that medical businesses use to make their operations more efficient. The operating margin associated with Optum has pretty consistently outpaced the margins for the insurance segment -- and Optum has been growing sales at a faster pace, too! UnitedHealth Group's hiccup has lowered its forward-year earnings multiple down to just 13, which is the lowest it's been in at least a half-decade. It also represents a34% discount to its average forward P/E ratio over the trailing five-year period. On the other end of the spectrum is one of the Dow's newest components, which makes for an easy avoid in May. I'm talking about semiconductor behemothNvidia(NVDA-0.64%), which has been riding theartificial intelligence (AI)wave. Nvidia's claim to fame is its Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell GPU architecture, which dominate as the brains of AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia's hardware is superior, in terms of compute potential. Additionally, with demand for AI-GPUs overwhelming supply, it's been able to charge a premium for its GPUs, which pumped up its gross margin to more than 78% one year ago. While the long-term future for AI remains bright, multiple headwinds stand in the way of Nvidia stock in the coming quarters (and perhaps next couple of years). To begin with, the Joe Biden administrationandTrump administrationclamped down on exports of high-powered AI chips and AI-related equipment to China. The world's No. 2 economy by GDP generates of billions of dollars in quarterly sales for Nvidia, which are at risk of shrinking considerably due to ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. We're also witnessing a significant uptick in competitive pressure. Aside from direct competitors rolling out less-costly GPUs,Nvidia could have the rug pulled out from under its feet by internal competition. Many of its top customers by net sales are internally developing GPUs and AI solutions for their respective data centers. These chips and solutions are considerably cheaper and more readily accessible than Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia'ssteadily declining gross margin since the fiscal first quarter of last yearstrongly suggests that its pricing power is waning. To build on this point, it's also possible Nvidia's rapid upgrade cycle -- it's planning to bring a new AI-GPU to market annually -- could lead to rapid GPU depreciation and irritate businesses that have already made sizable investments. In other words, we might be talking about its customers delaying future upgrade cycles. Lastly, every next-big-thing innovation for more than three decadeshas worked its way through a bubble. Investors consistently overestimate the adoption rate and early stage utility of game-changing technologies. With most businesses lacking a clear blueprint to maximize their AI solutions, we appear to be careening toward another bubble-bursting event. Should one occur, no AI stock would feel the brunt more than Nvidia.",

        "header": "Got $1,000? 2 Top Growth Stocks to Buy That Could Double Your Money",
        "content": "The concerns around tariffs and the impact on the economy triggered a sharp sell-off for stocks recently. But this uncertainty hasn't seemed to slow the momentum for the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Top companies enabling the AI era are still in position to deliver significant returns for investors. If you're looking to invest some extra cash this month, shares ofAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.84%)andMeta Platforms(META0.34%)could be timely buys. To double your money in five years, you need to earn around a 15%compound annual returnon your money. But these top tech stocks are expected to grow their earnings at higher rates. Image source: Getty Images. There is a massive investment cycle going into advanced processors to create new applications and services withAI.Nvidiahas been the runway leader in the AI chip market, but companies are looking for cheaper alternatives. This is an opportunity for Advanced Micro Devices. AMD shares have fallen 56% from their previous highs, but the company's accelerating growth over the past year suggests the stock is due for a rebound. Revenue grew 24% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and Wall Street analysts project the company's revenue to grow another 21% in 2025. Half of AMD's annual revenue is coming fromdata centers. AMD is also seeing surging demand for its EPYCcentral processing units (CPUs), which are now being used by several leading companies to power their servers, including recent deployments byServiceNow,Visa, LG, among others. The stock is down over concerns that AMD is losing ground to Nvidia in the AI chip market. AMD is not likely going to catch the leader, but investors are underestimating its growth potential as the only other alternative forgraphics processing units (GPUs)that can be adapted for a wide range of computing tasks. AMD has made key acquisitions over the last few years to widen its product offering to software solutions and other chip technologies that could stretch its addressable market. AMDhas been selling chips to all the top data center operators, includingAmazon,Alphabet, andMicrosoft. These companies launched new AI workloads in Q4 powered by AMD hardware. Analysts expect AMD's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 28% in the coming years, yet investors can currently buy the stock at just 23times 2025 earningsestimates. Meta Platforms is one of the leading digital advertisers. With about half the world's population using its social media platforms every day, it is investing huge sums in data centers and technology to support the growth of the business. In doing so, it is creating a valuable asset with its data center infrastructure that could drive excellent returns for investors over the long haul. Meta's investments in AI have significantly benefited the company's growth. The company reported a revenue increase of 16% year-over-year in the first quarter, which followed 22% growth in 2024. This growth came during a year when the Meta AI personal assistant reached more than 700 million monthly users. Meta AI could become one of the most popular AI assistants, which ultimately can increase time spent on the company's social media apps, and therefore, grow advertising revenue. AI is improving audience targeting, ad creation, and content discovery. Management noted during the first-quarter earnings call that 30% more advertisers are using AI creation tools compared to the previous quarter, indicating how these investments are strengthening its ad business. CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees a new type of interactive content coming in the near future, which would serve as the next progression of social media after photo and video. This could lead to more advertising opportunities. There's also an opportunity to drive more engagement across Meta's family of apps by enabling users to create better content with AI tools. The stock might be one of the most attractive buys among the \"Magnificent Seven\" right now. Analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 18% over the next several years, while Meta's stock trades at a very reasonable 24 times this year's earnings estimates.",

        "content": "Some investors who didn't buy artificial intelligence (AI) stocks last year may have worried that they missed their chance. Many of these stocks had soared, with valuations reaching sky-high levels, on optimism the technology would be the next big game changer -- as the internet was many years ago. In recent times, though, these top-performing stocks not only have taken a pause; in some cases they've actually plummeted. The good news is that this stock movement isn't a reflection of AI's potential. The market remains compelling, and analysts forecast it may reach beyond $2 trillion in the coming decade. Instead, theserecent stock price declinesare linked to general concerns about the economy and earnings growth in the near term. Investors worry that President Donald Trump's move to impose tariffs on imports could increase prices and eventually hurt the overall economy. So, even though companies in most industries could face challenges in the quarters ahead, there's reason to be optimistic about strong, well-established players. They have what it takes to manage difficult times and go on to grow. And all of this offers investors a fresh opportunity to get in on AI stocks at reasonable prices. With this in mind, one AI company in particular makes a fantastic buy right now in the month of May. Image source: Getty Images. This player jumped into the market right away, bringing its chips to AI customers before the AI boom took off, and it's demonstrated an impressive ability to evolve and innovate over time. I'm talking about chip giantNvidia(NVDA-0.64%). In the company's early days, it generated most of its revenue by selling itsgraphics processing units(GPUs) to the gaming market, but in recent years, sales of GPUs and related products and services to AI customers have made up the greatest share of revenue. In fact, in the most recent quarter, AI-related sales made up 90% of overall revenue. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market because its GPUs offer customers speed, efficiency, and other features that make them the best available. They also are the priciest, but customers such asMeta PlatformsandMicrosoft, for example, are eager to build the strongest of platforms, so they're willing to pay to reach their goals. Nvidia, to maintain dominance, has put a big focus on innovation. The company pledges to update its GPUs annually and already has set out its road map for the coming two years. Over the past couple of years, the AI boom has helped Nvidia generate double- and triple-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter. I like the fact that this is accompanied by a solid level of profitability, withgross marginsurpassing 70% even during times when expenses are higher -- such as during the recent rollout of the Blackwell architecture and chip. It's clear to me that Nvidia makes a great long-term AI investment. But why is now in particular a good time to buy? Nvidia has a couple of potential near-term catalysts in the form of its fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings report on May 28 and its shareholder meeting on June 25. The company just launched Blackwell this winter, and in its first quarter on the market it generated $11 billion in revenue. Demand for the platform has been high, so it's possible Nvidia will report another quarter of strong revenue, and that could offer the stock a boost in the near term. And thoughNvidia faces challenges, such as potential tariffs on imports and a U.S.-imposed halt on exports to China, the company has shown signs of finding solutions to its problems. For example, Nvidia recently launched an investment in U.S. manufacturing, and press reports suggest Nvidia aims to rework design of a chip to suit U.S. export rules. Any progress on projects aiming to beat those challenges could lift Nvidia stock price. If you buy Nvidia now, you'll get in on the stock at close to its lowest in a year in terms of price-to-forward earnings estimates. The stock is trading for 25 times earnings estimates, down from more than 48 times earlier this year. All of this means that by investing in Nvidia shares before May 28, you'll get in on the stock at a bargain price and potentially benefit from some near-term catalysts. And here's the really good news: Even if the stock doesn't take off right away, it's still positioned for a win over time thanks to Nvidia's dominance and innovation in the high-growth AI market.",

        "content": "Palantir Technologies(PLTR-0.27%)stock dropped 9.3% in after-hours trading on Monday following the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered data analytics company's release of its earnings report for the first quarter of 2025. It's safe to assume the main reason for the stock's decline was that the quarter's earnings \"only\" met Wall Street's consensus estimate. Granted, earnings growth was great, but simply meeting analysts' expectations is not usually good enough to prevent a post-earnings decline for a stock with a sky-high valuation. In other words, extremely high earnings growth expectations were already priced into Palantir stock. Going into the release, Palantir stock was trading at 238 times estimated earnings for the forward one-year period. For some context, shares ofNvidia, the leading AI chipmaker, andBroadcom, the leader in custom AI chips, were trading at 26 and 31 times forward projected earnings, respectively. As for the report's other key metrics, Palantir's first-quarter revenue breezed by Wall Street's expectation. The company's second-quarter revenue guidance came in notably higher than analysts had expected, and it significantly raised its full-year 2025 guidance for many metrics. Image source: Getty Images. Data source: Palantir Technologies.GAAP= generally accepted accounting principles. Calculations by author except for revenue growth, which was provided by Palantir. Investors should focus on the adjusted numbers, which exclude one-time items. Wall Street was looking for adjusted EPS of $0.13 on revenue of $862.1 million, so Palantir met the profit expectation and easily exceeded the revenue one. It also surpassed its guidance, which was for revenue between $858 million to $862 million. The company doesn't issue earnings guidance. Palantir generated cash of $310 million from running its operations during the quarter, up 139% from the year-ago period. Its adjusted free cash flow was $370 million, up 149% year over year. The company ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $5.4 billion, up from $5.2 billion last quarter. It has no long-term debt. All percentage growth figures are year over year. Q2 guidance: Going into the release, Wall Street had been modeling for Q2 revenue of $899 million, or 33% growth, so Palantir's guidance easily beat this expectation. Annual guidance: Wall Street Estimate $3.75 billion 52% to 53% (up from 38% to 39%) 28% to 44% (up from 20% to 36%) Data source: Palantir Technologies. YOY = year over year. *Calculations by author except for total revenue and U.S. commercial revenue growth guidance, which Palantir provided. In short, Palantir turned in a stellar report. Granted, the stock fell, but it's not the company's fault that many investors have unrealistic expectations for near-term earnings growth. In Nov. 2024, I wrote thatPalantir stock has what it takes to be the \"next Nvidia stock\" -- a massive long-term winner. I still believePalantir stock is a buy-- but investors need to be careful given the stock's sky-high valuation of 238 times forward projected earnings. Only folks with long investing horizons should consider buying Palantir stock. And if you do decide to buy it, it's imperative to dollar-cost-average (DCA) your way into your full position. That means investing the same dollar amount in the stock at some fixed interval, such as quarterly. This method will ensure that you don't risk buying all your shares in the stock right before a significant decline.",

        "header": "Could Investing $10,000 in Super Micro Computer Make You a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Turning $10,000 into $1 million is no small feat. That requires a return of 100 times on your investment, and few companies can deliver that. For this to work properly, you need a stock that's relatively inexpensive, is in the middle of a general trend, and doesn't have too high a market cap to begin with. Super Micro Computer(SMCI-4.54%), commonly called Supermicro, checks all of those boxes. It is a participant in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, is valued at a dirt cheap price, and tips the scales at a $19.2 billion valuation. So, does Supermicro have the ability to turn $10,000 into $1 million? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. If Supermicro's stock would rise 100-fold, it would be worth $1.9 trillion. That's not the world's largest company, but it would place it around the top five. That's huge growth, but a rise like that wouldn't yield a value that's unrealistic. Supermicro makes server racks in which companies place high-performance computing hardware, such asNvidia(NVDA-0.64%)GPUs. Properly configuring and cooling these devices is crucial to their use, which is where Supermicro comes in. It has technologies like direct liquid cooling (DLC) that cool devices more efficiently and allow more computing hardware to be packed into a tighter space because airflow isn't required to cool these units. Supermicro's DLC can deliver up to 40% energy savings and 80% space savings, which reduces both operating and construction costs. This is a crucial business that will benefit from the AI boom, which is why management believes it's on a path to a $50 billion revenue run rate. Considering that it generated $20 billion in revenue during the past 12 months, that's strong growth. However, that's not nearly enough to turn Supermicro into a company that could turn $10,000 into $1 million. Supermicro is just one part of the AI build-out investment trend. Most people are investing in Nvidia since it generates sky-high margins on its products. Supermicro is still a worthy consideration, but its margins are much slimmer, and there is a lot more competition in its industry. Furthermore, if it became a nearly $2 trillion company, Nvidia would likely rise 100-fold from its current level, too, because most of Supermicro's racks house Nvidia GPUs. This just isn't realistic considering Nvidia's $2.8 trillion market cap. But just because a company doesn't have 100-bagger potential doesn't mean it can't be a solid investment. So, is Supermicro worth buying here now? As mentioned above, Supermicro's stock is dirt cheap. It tips the scales at just13.2 times forward earnings.  SMCI PE Ratiodata byYCharts; PE = price to earnings. This stock is cheap because theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.64%)trades for about 21 times forward earnings. However, there's a reason for that. There isn't much to separate one competitor from another in Supermicro's industry, so the stock doesn't have a premium attached to it. Another reason is that allegations of accounting irregularities rocked the stock last year, although the company has since been cleared of any wrongdoing. Those allegations left a bad taste in investors' mouths, so many are avoiding the stock as a result. And the business' execution isn't always top tier. For its fiscal third quarter (ended March 31), management preannounced results because it now expects sales to come in at about $4.5 billion, down from its prior $5 billion to $6 billion projected range. The company blamed some delayed customer decisions from the third quarter to the fourth, but this still isn't a great sign. As a result, I don't think investors need to invest in Supermicro. I would rather own a stock like Nvidia\u00a0that is a muchbetter playon the same trend that Supermicro is riding.",

        "header": "3 Cheap \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Load Up On",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks hasn't really been known for being called cheap. This group includes some big tech high-flyers that led the market over the past few years but have gotten slammed this year. They are: All seven of these stocks are off their all-time highs alongside the market, amid uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's trade policies. But only a few of these stocks have tumbled to price points where the stocks can actually be considered cheap. The three that I think fit this bill are Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. With each of these stocks more attractively price today, I think right now represents an excellent time to buy some shares at a discount. Here's why. Nvidia has been an absolute rocket ship over the past few years, but that ship has slowed in 2025. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)are the best in class and have been heavily used in the AI race. GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, an effect that can be further amplified by connecting hundreds of GPUs in clusters. With the combined computing power, these data centers can train and run AI models, but investors fear that the gravy train may be slowing. Investors are worried about how a trade war might affect data center spending, which would harm Nvidia if it dropped. However, that has largely been proved false, at least so far. Microsoft said that for its fiscal 2026 (ending July 2026), capital expenditure plans remain unchanged, and it is making investments in data centers to capture the cloud and AI opportunities. Alphabet also echoed this sentiment, so it isn't planning on changing capital expenditure plans, either. Despite the prevailing notion that Nvidia won't be successfully challenged, the stock remains at a far lower valuation than is historically normal.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts; PE = price to earnngs. At less than 25 times forward earnings, Nvidia's stock looks like a bargain here because it's still expected to put up strong growth after this year. With that valuation hovering around where theS&P 500is trading (at 20.5 times forward earnings), I think that's a compelling enough value to take a position in the stock. Along the same lines as Nvidia, investors are worried about how a trade war could affect the advertising markets. Ad revenue is the first expense to get slashed when an economic downturn or recession is coming, and with both of these companies generating a massive amount of revenue from ads, it could spell trouble for these two. However, long-term investors can take solace in the fact that advertising revenue comes back once the economy improves. With the market already pricing in a downturn in both of these stocks, today's price could be a great price to pay for these two ad players.  GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. At less than 17 times forward earnings, Alphabet stock is dirt cheap. Another factor looming over it are two court cases that ruled the company is an illegal monopoly in the search engine and ad marketplace. While this issue is still years away from resolving itself, the market wants no part of the stock in the meantime. Meta Platforms doesn't have those same impending issues, so it gets a bit more of a premium, but its 22 forward earnings multiple is among the cheapest prices you could pay for it over the past year. I think all three of these stocks represent compelling values right now, and investors should pounce on them while they are still bargains. However, if the tariff situation improves or the economy proves resilient,they won't stay there for long.",

The company said when it reported first-quarter production and deliverieslast monththat its changeover to manufacturing the new Model Y cost it several weeks of production. Tesla has been thetarget of protestsin recent months as people in the U.S. and abroad have looked to voice their displeasure about CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration.

        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Traders are expecting a modest post-earnings move from the stock, which has fallen so far this year. Options pricing suggests traders are positioning for AMD stock to move nearly 8% in the days after it reports. An 8% jump off Monday\u2019s closing price would put the stock at about $108.50, its highest price since late March, and an 8% decline would put it around $92.50, erasing all of the stock\u2019s gains from the last week. A move of that magnitude\u2014in either direction\u2014would be about in line with AMD's average post-earnings swing over the past four quarters, which comes out to 7.5%.The stock tumbled more than 6% the day after its fourth-quarter data center revenue, which rose 69% from the prior year,fell shortof expectations in February. Shares dropped more than 10% on AMD'sdisappointing earnings reportin October. Analysts expect AMD to report first-quarter data center revenue rose 55% to $3.6 billion, driving total sales growth of 30%. Adjusted earnings are expected to jump more than 50% year-over-year to $1.55 billion, or 94 cents a share. Analystsare spliton the outlook for AMD and its stock heading into Tuesday\u2019s earnings. Half of the 12 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha rate AMD stock a buy, while five assign it a \u201chold\u201d rating and one recommends selling. The consensus price target is $123.50, implying a 23% return from Monday\u2019s close. The Trump administration last month tightened restrictions on semiconductor exports to China, a move that Bank of America analysts called an \u201ceffective shipment ban\u201d on AMD\u2019s MI308 chip and Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) H20.AMD subsequently warned that it could be saddled with charges ofup to $800 millionif it can\u2019t secure export licenses. Analysts expect the new restrictions to weigh heavily on AMD, Nvidia, and other chipmakers\u2019 sales to China. Meanwhile, massive AI infrastructure investment is expected to be a tailwind for AMD as it navigates an uncertain economic outlook. AI demand remains robust, according to major cloud service providers likeMicrosoft(MSFT),Alphabet(GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), who are all standing by their plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the technology this year. AMD shares have lost about 36% of their value in the past 12 months, and are down about 17% since the start of the year.",

The autonomous vehicle pioneer yesterday announced a significant expansion of its strategic partnership withUber Technologies. This drove investor enthusiasm. Image source: Getty Images. WeRide and Uber announced a major expansion of their existing partnership on Monday. The companies will add 15 additional cities globally over the next five years -- including locations in Europe -- to the rollout of WeRide's robotaxi services. The announcement makes one of the largest partnerships of its kind in the autonomous vehicle industry and helps accelerate the timeline for WeRide's global deployment of its technology. Under the terms of the partnership, WeRide's robotaxi services will be available through the Uber app in these new markets, while Uber will handle fleet operations. This division of responsibilities plays to each company's strengths: WeRide provides the autonomous technology, and Uber contributes its existing massive user base and operational expertise. The expanded partnership builds on the companies' initial collaboration in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Yesterday's announcement suggests China-headquartered WeRide is pulling ahead ofmany autonomous vehicle competitorsin the race to actually bring the technology to market. However, stiff competition remains from major players likeTeslaandAlphabet-backed Waymo. Uber also announced today it was partnering withPony AIto roll out in certain Middle East markets, with more to come. WeRide operates deep in the red, but that is not unusual for a company like it. This will change once its technology establishes itself and sales grow. The company's stock is also slightly better priced than Pony AI's, and it has the backing ofNvidia. For those with patience and a high risk tolerance, I think WeRide is a good pick.",

        "content": "Businesses stockpiled imported goods in March before President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs took hold, new trade data showed Tuesday\u2014but economists said the surge won\u2019t last long. TheU.S. trade deficitsoared 14% to reach $140.5 billion in March, the highest level ever recorded, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau data.The trade deficit nearly doubled in the first quarter compared to the same time last year. Increased imports drove the surge, as businesses stocked up on foreign goods before tariffs took effect, economists said. \u201cEven coming after large increases in the preceding months, the March deficit jumped amid a rapid stocking up of high-value consumer goods, most notably pharmaceutical preparations,\u201d wrote Moody\u2019s Analytics Economist Mark Hopkins. Economists anticipated the jump after preliminary data earlier this month initially indicated thatimports were surging. Following up onhis campaign promise, Trump has instituted aseries of tariffson foreign imports, which are expected to push inflation higher\u00a0andweaken U.S. trade. Many U.S. tariffs weren\u2019t scheduled to take effect until April, and some were postponed until even later asnegotiations take place. \u201cThis gives businesses a bit more time to get product in ahead of tariffs, and suggests we may see a last-ditch effort in the April data. But beyond that, we expect trade to slow materially,\u201d wrote Wells Fargo economists Shannon Grein and Tim Quinlan. Because of the timing of tariffs, economists expect the trade deficit to drop significantly in the upcoming months. \u201cEven if tariffs are rolled back significantly in the weeks or months ahead, the large front-running that has occurred means businesses won\u2019t need to source as much product as they unwind inventory,\u201d the Wells Fargo note said.",

        "content": "Hasbro and Mattel have joined the toy industry in fighting tariffs that could cost them millions. But there could be some trade-policy upside for the domestic toy giants. Nearly80% of toys sold in the US come from China, which is subject to aminimum import tax of 145%. But Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel\u2019s (MAT) manufacturing is less concentrated there. If tariffs strain their competitors, the two companies may play a bigger role in stocking toy stores, J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a research note Tuesday. \u201cIndependents could be either priced out of the market or made insolvent,\" they wrote, leaving Mattel and Hasbro \"positioned well to fill retail shelf space,\u201d they said. Mattel, the company behind Barbie and Hot Wheels, and Hasbro, which sells Play-Doh, Furby and the board game Monopoly, have been shifting production away from China for years. About 20% of Mattel\u2019s imports hail from China, and it aims to bring this down to 10% by 2027, executives said on an conference call Monday. Mattel aims to counteract the $270 million cost of tariffs in 2025 by relocating manufacturing, making other production shifts and raising prices, executives said. Mattel\u2019s relatively diverse supply chain gives it a \u201ccompetitive advantage,\u201d CEO Ynon Kreiz said, adding that the company is still \u201ccalling for zero tariffs on toys.\u201d Mattel thinks limiting price increases may give it an edge, executives said. About 50% to 60% of its merchandise was available for $20 or less last year, and the company wants to keep about 40% to 50% of products at that price point, J.P. Morgan said. \u201cThere is potential upside if there\u2019s [product] shortages, generally, or opportunities to gain additional shelf space,\u201d CFO Anthony DiSilvestro said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense. About half of Hasbro's toys and games in the US come from China, and Hasbro wants to shrink that to less than 40% by 2026, executives said last month.\u00a0Hasbro CFO Gina Goetter acknowledged current trade policy may offer the company some advantages. \u201cWith our retailers\u2014the discussions that we\u2019re having\u2014we\u2019re anticipating some [shelving] opportunities, and stepping into some white space,\u201d Goetter said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense. Tariff expenses may add up to as much as $300 million in 2025, but Hasbro thinks it can limit the hit to $180 million or less by diversifying its supply chain, changing its product lineup and cutting company costs, leaders said. Still, price increases are likely, Hasbro said. The Toy Association has said that import taxes could result in supply shortages. The trade group last month called for \u201can immediate reprieve from tariffs\u201d to ensure that toys are \u201cavailable for the holiday season.\" Mattel said Monday it was \"pausing\" its guidance for 2025, citing a \"volatile\" economic environment; it had earlier predicted a rise of a few percentage points.Hasbro last month kept in place the 2025 projection of a slight increase in revenue it offered in February.",

        "content": "You're not far from retirement whenyou get laid off from your job. Here's how to figure out if you're ready forearly retirementor if you should go back to the job market. Alayoffis disheartening at any age, but with retirement in sight, it can be extra challenging. The first step is to take stock of your finances. \u201cStart by taking inventory of your financial and professional capital. How marketable are your skills? How much flexibility do you have in your retirement timeline?\u201d says Joseph Boughan, a certified financial planner atParkmount Financial Partners. \u201cReview your emergency savings, projected retirement income, and living expenses.\u201d Once you have a complete picture of your finance, you\u2019ll know how urgent or nonessential it is to get another job. \u201cThis will help you determine how urgently you need to replace income\u2014and whether you\u2019re looking for a stopgap, apart-time job, or a fresh chapter in your career,\u201d Boughan says. Maybe you\u2019re not interested in getting another job or maybe you\u2019d prefer to retire early. If so, you'll want to check that you can afford early retirement. Here\u2019s how to tell if it's an option for you: \u201cEvaluate how much sustainable income you can safely withdraw from your investment portfolio. If you\u2019re retiring earlier than planned, don\u2019t overlook taxes and penalties tied to certain retirement accounts,\u201d Boughan says. For example, if you take money out of an individual retirement account (IRA) or 401(k) before age 59\u00bd, you may be on the hook for a 10% penalty.If you have enough money across your savings, income streams, and investments, you may be able to leave the job market completely and retire early. \u201cOnce you have a clear picture of your financial situation, ask yourself how long your money would last if you stopped working today,\u201d saysJohn Abernethy, acertified financial planner (CFP)at Together Planning. \u201cYou may find you\u2019re closer to retirement than you realized. Retirement doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. It just needs to be flexible enough to work.\u201d If you think you may have enough money to retire early, it may be wise to get a second opinion by meeting with a financial planner. They\u2019ll go over your finances and offer suggestions. Where should you turn for healthcare if you're not yet old enough forMedicare? \u201cIf you\u2019re not yet eligible for Medicare, look into your state\u2019sAffordable Care Act (ACA)Marketplace. These plans are comprehensive and, depending on your income, can be more affordable than you might think,\u201d Boughan says. \u201cIf you\u2019re temporarily living off savings or in a lower tax bracket due to the layoff, you may qualify for subsidies that significantly reduce your monthly premiums.\u201d Remember, the Affordable Care Act Marketplace doesn't consider your investments or total net worth, only your income and family size. \u201cMany early retirees qualify for subsidies that make coverage surprisingly affordable, even with significant savings, because the subsidy is based onincome, notnet worth,\u201d Abernethy says. Other options for healthcare includeseverance packages, getting on a spouse\u2019s health plan, signing up forCOBRA, and going to a health insurance broker. \u201cSeverance packages can include continuation of your health insurance for a certain\u00a0period of time. This could possibly get you to Medicare age of 65,\u201d saysDave Flegal, a certified financial planner and founder of Flegal Financial Planning. \u201cIf your spouse is still working, this is likely your most affordable option since employers generally help pay insurance premiums.\u201d Temporarily continuing the health plan you had with your employer is an option through COBRA, but it will be an expensive choice. \u201cWhile you were employed, your employer likely paid part of your premium and you paid part of it.\u00a0\u00a0For COBRA, you must pay both the employer and employee premium, which is why it\u2019s often more expensive,\u201d Flegal says. \u201cCOBRA typically lasts for 18\u00a0months, but\u00a0can be extended in certain circumstances.\u201d A final option is to find health insurance through an insurance broker. A broker has access to a wide range of health insurance carriers. \u201cMore carriers are available compared to the Marketplace, and you\u2019re likely to be able to find a plan that fits your exact needs, but they can also be more expensive,\u201d Flegal says. Should you head back into the job market so close toretirement? There are employment opportunities available for people approaching retirement age. \u201cWhile age discrimination is real, the labor force is shrinking as more baby boomers retire and fewer Gen X workers enter to replace them. That creates opportunity for experienced professionals willing to stay engaged,\u201d Boughan says. Target your job search to employers that will value your long work experience. \u201cFocus on industries that value reliability and institutional knowledge, and don\u2019t underestimate the value ofnetworking,\u201d Boughan says. \u201cStaying positive and proactive is key.\u201d A layoff in the years before retirement can be shocking, but it can also be an opportunity. Are you ready to retire early? A close examination of your savings, investments, and income streams may show you that early retirement is a viable option. For other people, a layoff means getting back in the job market as soon as possible, especially for those who don't have a lot of money saved and have few income streams. This group of people may need to work longer and save more before they're ready for retirement.",

Shares of AMD rose more than 4% in extended trading.  Here\u2019s how the chipmaker did versus LSEG expectations for the quarter that ended March 29:  * **Earnings per share**: 96 cents adjusted vs. 94 cents expected * **Revenue**: $7.44 billion vs. $7.13 billion expected  For the current quarter, AMD expects about $7.4 billion in sales with a gross margin of 43%, versus Wall Street estimates for earnings of 86 cents adjusted on $7.25 billion in sales.  AMD\u2019s forecast also included $800 million in costs that the company said it would incur because the U.S.\u00a0limited the export of some of the company\u2019s artificial intelligence chips\u00a0during the quarter.  The company reported net income of $709 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, versus net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share, during the year-earlier period. Revenue grew 36% on an annual basis.  AMD is the second-place server central processing unit vendor, behind\u00a0Intel, but its Epyc line of processors has been taking market share in recent years.  The company is also\u00a0the closest competitor\u00a0to\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0for \u201cbig GPUs,\u201d or graphics processing units. Those are the kind of chips that are deployed in data centers by the thousands for building generative AI. It did $5 billion in AI GPU sales in the company\u2019s fiscal 2024.  Both are reported in the company\u2019s data center segment, which came in at $3.7 billion in sales, topping a StreetAccount estimate. Data center sales were up 57% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs.  The company\u2019s other major segment, Client and Gaming, includes chips for consumer devices such as laptops, gaming PCs and game consoles. The overall segment rose 28% on an annual basis to $2.9 billion. AMD said sales for its laptop and PC chips, which it calls client revenue, surged 68% year over year because of strong demand for chips called Zen 5 that the company released last summer.  Gaming sales, however, declined 30% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to a decrease in console chip revenue.  AMD\u2019s embedded segment, which is mostly sales from the company\u2019s 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, declined 3% on an annual basis to $823 million.
