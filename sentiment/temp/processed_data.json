        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped in extended trading on Wednesday after the AI chipmaker surpassed Wall Street'squarterly revenue expectations. The company announced after the closing bell that its fiscal first-quarter sales rose 69% to a record $44.06 billion, as major technology companies continue to ramp up spending on AI infrastructure. Profit was lower than analysts had estimated, as the company recordeda $4.5 billion chargein the quarter due to restrictions on the sale of its H20 chips to China, though the amount was less than the$5.5 billionthe company said it anticipated last month. CEOJensen Huangsaid global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructureremains \"incredibly strong\", adding that he sees accelerating demand for AI computing with the use ofAI agentsbecoming mainstream. Nvidia shares slumped between January and early April amid concerns of a slowdown in AI spending and the Trump administration\u2019s unpredictable trade policies. However, the stock has rebounded 56% from last month\u2019s low as trade tensions eased and the chipmaker announced apartnership with an AI subsidiary of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The stock rose nearly 5% to just above $141 in after-hours trading Wednesday. The stock hasn't traded above $140 during regular trading hours since February. Below, we dial into Nvidia\u2019s four-hour chart and applytechnical analysisto identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. Nvidia shares rallied sharply after breaking out from apennantearlier this month, before consolidating again within aflagpattern above the closely watched200-day moving average (MA). More recently, the stock has broken out above the flag pattern\u2019s upper trendline, a move that has coincided with the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day MA to form a bullishgolden cross. Indeed, the stock\u2019s upside momentum looks set to continue, though investors should watch iftrading volumeconfirms the move higher. During the lead-up to earnings, share turnover had declined, indicating investors remained on the sidelines ahead of the highly anticipated results. Let\u2019s identify three major overhead areas on Nvidia\u2019s chart to watch if the stock continues tracking higher and also locate asupport levelworth monitoring during potential retracements. Investors should initially keep their eyes peeled on the $143 area. The shares may run into overheadresistanceat this level near the prominent mid-Februaryswing high, which also closely corresponds with a range of trading activity on the chart extending back to late October. A close above this area could see the shares climb to around $150. Investors who have averaged into the stock at lower prices may decide tolock in profitsin this location near several peaks that formed on the chart between November and January just below the stock\u2019srecord high. To projects an upsideprice targetif the stock moves intoprice discoverymode, investors can use the bars pattern tool. When applying the analysis to Nvidia\u2019s chart, we take the strong move higher that preceded the flag and reposition it from the pattern\u2019sbreakoutpoint. This projects a target of around $160, nearly 20% above Wednesday\u2019s closing price. During retracements, it\u2019s worth monitoring the $130 level. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this region near a multi-monthhorizontal linethat connects the bottom of the flag pattern with a series ofpeaks and troughson the chart stretching back to August last year.

The ruling also stopped Trump from enforcing the tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China that were aimed at combating fentanyl entering the U.S. The ruling said that \"trafficking tariffs\" of 25% imposed on products from Canada and Mexico, and 20% on those from China, \"fail because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those Orders.\" The panel said those tariff orders would be \u201cpermanently\u201d stopped.

        "content": "TheS&P 500has a long track record of success despite most individual stocks underperforming. In fact, according to a J.P. Morgan study, between 1980 and 2020, two-thirds of stocks in theRussell 3000index, which consists of the 3,000 largest U.S.-traded companies, underperformed the S&P 500 during that span, while 40% had negative returns. So what's the secret behind the S&P 500's success? One of the biggest factors behind its strong performance is that it is amarket capitalization(market cap) index that lets its winners run. Ultimately, it is these megawinner growth companies that help power its returns. Let's look at three S&P 500 companies with significant growth potential. Added to the S&P 500 last year,Palantir Technologies(PLTR0.28%)has some of the best growth potential of any company. The data gathering and analytics company saw strong, accelerating revenue growth over the past year, and both the U.S. government and commercial customers embrace itsArtificial IntelligencePlatform (AIP). While much of the focus on AI has been creating ever-better AI models, Palantir instead focused on the workflow and application software layers of AI to create an orchestration platform that can harness the power of AI models to help solve real-world problems. It does this by collecting data from disparate sources and structuring it into an \"ontology\" that then maps that data to real-world objects and processes. It has recently introduced AI agents within its platform that help automate decisions and drive action. Its solutions are being embraced across industries, including hospital operators, pipeline companies, insurance companies, and telecom companies. The breadth of problems to which Palantir's solutions can be applied is absolutely massive, and why the stock has the potential to eventually become a huge winner. The biggest risk to the stock fulfilling its potential is its high valuation and any impact on its business from reduced government spending. Image source: Getty Images. Previously a sleepy chip and networking giant,Broadcom(AVGO1.56%)has some huge growth potential. The company's hardware and software businesses could both see some strong growth over the coming years. On the software side, Broadcom is looking to transform the business model of its recent acquisition, VMware. Since acquiring the virtualization and cloud computing solutions company in November 2023, it streamlined its operations and product solutions and began transitioning customers to a subscription model. The key for its software business moving forward is its VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform, which lets customers manage workloads across public clouds and their own on-premise data centers. With enterprises starting to turn to AI hybrid solutions, Broadcom is nicely positioned to upsell its customers to VCF. On the hardware side, Broadcom makes components for a variety of markets, but its biggest opportunities are in networking and ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). On the networking side, its components, such as Ethernet switches and network interface cards (NICs), are vital in managing the flow of data and distributing AI workloads across servers to make sure resources are being used best. However, it is the company's custom AI chip business that holds the most potential. Custom AI chips can outperform and use less power than mass-marketgraphics processing units (GPUs)for the specific tasks for which they are designed.Alphabetwas its first customer, and its success has led to it winning additional customers. Broadcom sees a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market opportunity in its fiscal year 2027 (ending October 2027) with its three furthest-along customers; however, it has added more, includingApple. This is a huge opportunity for a company that generated $51.6 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2024. The biggest risk to the stock would be a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending. While a distant No. 2 player toNvidiain the GPU market,Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-1.43%)has the potential to be another huge AI infrastructure winner. The company carved out a strong place in the data center market with itscentral processing units (CPUs), which act as the brain of a server, while GPUs provide the power. The market isn't as large as the GPU market, but it is still a big and growing one, and AMD has been taking market share. However, its biggest opportunity could be withAI inference. While Nvidia's GPUs have been the preferred chips to help train AI models, AMD has been able to carve out a nice niche in the inference space. On its last earnings call, AMD boasted that one of the largest AI model companies was now using its GPUs to process a significant percentage of its daily inference traffic. This is important because eventually, the AI inference market is expected to become much larger than the AI training market. With the company having established itself in this market and its GPUs much cheaper than those of Nvidia, it has a real opportunity to take some share in what could be a huge, growing market over the next few years. The biggest risk to AMD's stock would also be a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, as well as it always being an afterthought to Nvidia.",

        "content": "Shares ofNvidia(NVDA-0.27%)gained 4.9% in Wednesday's after-hours trading, following the artificial intelligence (AI) tech leader's release of a better-than-expected report for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended April 27, 2025). The main catalysts for the stock's rise are the quarter's revenue and earnings beating Wall Street's expectations, with the profit beat a sizable one. Second-quarter revenue and earnings guidance fell slightly short of the analyst consensus estimates, but not enough to be a concern. Recently, most companies are being particularly conservative with guidance -- or not issuing it at all -- due to extreme uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment stemming from U.S. trade policy. Image source: Getty Images. Data source: Nvidia. YOY = year over year.GAAP= generally accepted accounting principles. Fiscal Q1 2026 ended April 27, 2025. Investors should focus on the adjusted numbers, which exclude one-time items. Wall Street was looking for adjusted EPS of $0.75 on revenue of $43.25 billion, so Nvidia exceeded both expectations. Nvidia's results were much better than they might seem at first glance. Both the top and bottom lines were hurt bynew U.S. government export controlson the company's H20 chip, which it had specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with the government's second round of advanced AI chip export controls. As a result of the new export controls of which Nvidia was informed on April 9 (so 18 days before the end of the quarter), the company incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter associated with \"H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations.\" The company said sales of H20 chips were $4.6 billion for the first quarter prior to the new restrictions, and that it was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20s in the quarter. Excluding the H20 charge and related tax impact, Nvidia's adjusted EPS would have surged 57% year over year to $0.96. This result is a more accurate reflection of the company's underlying business performance. Data source: Nvidia. OEM = original equipment manufacturer; OEM and other is not a target-market platform. YOY = year over year. QOQ = quarter over quarter. The data center segment's revenue accounted for nearly 89% of Nvidia's total revenue, up from almost 87% in the year-ago period. This segment's growth is being driven by the powerful demand for Nvidia's products that enableAIcapabilities. Gaming also had a great quarter -- indeed, it generated record quarterly revenue. CEO Jensen Huang's statement from the earnings release: Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer -- a 'thinking machine' designed for reasoning -- is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers. Global demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and NVIDIA stands at the center of this profound transformation. For Q2 of fiscal 2026, which ends in late July, management expects revenue of $45.0 billion, which equates to growth of 50% year over year. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of about $8.0 billion due to the recently enacted export controls. Management also guided (albeit indirectly by providing a bunch of inputs) for adjusted EPS of $0.98, or 44% growth. Going into the report, Wall Street had been modeling for Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.99 on revenue of $45.66 billion, so the company's outlook fell just slightly short on both counts. But it's extremely likely management is being extra conservative on guidance given the uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy and the possibility of further export restrictions. Importantly, the company reiterated that it's \"continuing to work toward achieving gross margins in the mid-70% range late this year.\" In short, Nvidia did a superb job in the quarter despite being blindsided by the H20 export controls at the tail end of the quarter. Moreover, Q2 guidance is very solid, particularly considering the Chinese market headwinds. It makes good sense that investors are pushing the stock price up.",

Premarket, chip stocks rallied across the board: Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology gained 6.3%, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) rose 4%, ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) climbed 4%, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) added 3.5%, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 3.4%, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) was up 1.8%, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) increased 1.9%. Nvidia itself has gained around 6.5%. The move came after Nvidia reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter results as Chinese customers stockpiled its AI chips ahead of new export curbs. While the company warned that current-quarter sales would be hit by about $8 billion due to the restrictions, investors had anticipated worse. Investors were also encouraged by Nvidia\u2019s commentary on robust demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips. CEO Jensen Huang said on the earnings call that the company sees \u201ca line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure.\u201d Huang acknowledged that U.S. trade policy continues to weigh on the company\u2019s China business but framed President Trump\u2019s recent move to rescind the \u201cAI diffusion\u201d rule as a positive shift. \u201cPresident Trump wants America to win,\u201d Huang said.

China had the second most students in the US of any country in 2024, behind India. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning accused the US of taking its decision \u201cunder the pretext of ideology and national security\u201d at a regular briefing in Beijing on Thursday, adding that it would harm people-to-people relations. \u201cSuch a politicized and discriminatory move lays bare the US lie behind the so-called freedom and openness that the US touts,\u201d she added. \u201cIt will only further undermine its image in the world and national reputation.\u201d The decision comes just weeks after the US and China negotiated a truce in their tariff war. The issue of revoking visas could now emerge as another flashpoint between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, potentially upending progress made on trade. It will also add to heightened tensions over sales to China of sophisticated chips and Beijing\u2019s determination to limit US access to rare earths, which have been simmering even after the breakthrough agreement in Geneva to sharply lower tariffs for 90 days as officials try to strike a broader deal. \u201cThis action intends to build a wall between two countries,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, director at Fudan University\u2019s Center for American Studies in Shanghai. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will help facilitate the forthcoming trade talks between two sides.\u201d Follow The Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen. The move followed Rubio\u2019s order a day earlier instructing US embassies worldwide to stop scheduling interviews for student visas as the administration weighs stricter vetting of applicants\u2019 social-media profiles. It marks yet another effort by President Donald Trump\u2019s push to restrict foreign students\u2019 entry to American schools over claims that they might threaten US national security. The White House has waged a high-stakes battle with universities that initially focused on elite universities such as Harvard and Columbia over antisemitism. That has turned into a bigger attack over the role of US higher education and the foreign students whose tuition is a crucial source of income for schools around the country. \u201cFor the ones that really can make a contribution, want to make a difference, we want to make it possible for them to come here and bring their great ideas, bring their great intellect and help us build a great America,\u201d Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cI think the administration is all in on that and I don\u2019t think anything they have said changes that.\u201d The scrutiny of Chinese students and researchers in the US in recent years dates back to Trump\u2019s first term, as part of a broader attack on China\u2019s ties in the US. The Trump administration announced in 2020 that the Confucius Institute US Center, a program funded by the Chinese government that\u2019s dedicated to teaching Chinese language and culture in the US, had to register as a \u201cforeign mission,\u201d making it subject to administrative requirements similar to those for embassies and consulates. Later the same year, the US revoked the visas of more than 1,000 Chinese students and researchers for national security reasons. In 2018, the Justice Department created a project to investigate and prosecute Chinese and Chinese-American researchers it said were stealing American secrets while hiding their links to the government in Beijing and to the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Known as the \u201cChina Initiative,\u201d the program was shut down four years later after coming under intense criticism for fanning discrimination against Asian-Americans. The visa restrictions announced on Wednesday extend a broader crackdown underway since Trump reclaimed the White House this year. Hours earlier, the US president said Harvard should cap foreign student enrollment at 15%, escalating his campaign to force policy changes at the elite institution. The State Department extended its scrutiny of those at Harvard beyond student visas to all visa holders, including those with business and tourist documents, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Rubio told senators last week that the number of revoked student visas is \u201cprobably in the thousands at this point,\u201d adding that \u201ca visa\u2019s not a right \u2014 it\u2019s a privilege.\u201d International students accounted for 5.9% of the total US higher education population of almost 19 million. In the 2023-2024 school year, more than 1.1 million foreign students came to the US, with India and China accounting for about half, according to the Institute of International Education. Last year, America sold a net $32 billion in services to China \u2014 including education, travel and entertainment \u2014 more than double the amount in 2022 and accounting for 11% of the nearly $300 billion global total. Almost a third of US services exports to China were related to education, coming from tuition and living expenses for the Chinese students studying in the US. The number of Chinese students has declined in the US \u2014 it fell 4% to about 277,000 students in 2024 \u2014 amid increased tension between the two adversaries. The FBI has warned that China has sought to exploit \u201cAmerica\u2019s deeply held and vital culture of collaboration and openness on university campuses.\u201d The State Department is also clamping down more on foreigners seeking to come to the US more broadly as part of Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration. Earlier Wednesday, Rubio announced visa restrictions on foreign officials and other individuals who \u201ccensor Americans,\u201d including those who target American technology companies. Taking action against people with links to the Chinese Communist Party is a sweeping measure, given the role it plays in the lives of Chinese people and institutions, including universities and enterprises. While just under 100 million people count as members of the party, its reach is so pervasive that the number of those who can be said to have ties with it runs into multiples of that figure. What happens next is less clear. During his visit to the US to meet with then President Joe Biden, Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to bring 50,000 young Americans to China to stabilize ties over a period of five years. That he\u2019s lent his name to such an effort could suggest China will be less inclined to engage in tit-for-tat by targeting American students in China. Even if it did, that number is minuscule, with the US State Department saying in April last year the figure was fewer than 900 students. In the past, the two sides vented their fury at one another by closing consulates. China shuttered the US consulate in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu. That came just days after the US government forced their Chinese counterparts out of their mission in Houston in 2020. But this time, China has other options. Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Center for China Analysis, said a possible response may be indirect, such as new export controls on critical minerals. \u201cBeijing is increasingly realizing the power of its export control regime to apply pressure on global supply chains and Western political leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cBeijing will be angry and ask more questions about how successful the Geneva talks really were at laying the groundwork for a US-China deal.\u201d --With assistance from James Mayger, Derek Wallbank, Yasufumi Saito and Philip Glamann.

        "content": "Nina Schick, who is an author, adviser, and speaker specializing in generative AI, tellsMadison Millsand Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick that the US\u2013China tech race is the \"most important geopolitical story\" of the 21st century. Schick joins Catalysts to take a closer look at the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) race, outlining the battle for AI dominance, and explaining the \"Achilles heel\" of each superpower: compute for China and energy for the US. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere. Nvidia's earnings results bring into focus the geopolitical tensions surrounding artificial intelligence as the world's two largest economies look to win the race for AI dominance, with the U.S. restricting sales of powerful AI chips to China. Joining us now, we've got Nina Schick, author and advisor specializing in AI, geopolitics, and power. Nina, it's great to have you here with us. I know you say controlling AI is not just about the technology, it's about writing the rules for the next century of global power. How does that inform your thinking on who the winners and losers to come out of this moment may be? Well, I think the first thing to say is that this is the most important geopolitical story of our time, of the 21st century, because traditionally technology has always been an accelerator of global power. But when we're talking about actually artificial intelligence, when we're talking about actually being able to create intelligence that is cheap and available like a commodity, well, that's fundamentally different from any technology we've had in the past. And that's why you see this talk of the AI war. And to be completely honest with you, even though all countries are starting to understand that there's this new kind of geopolitical order being shaped by technology dominance, the two players in the race, and of course it sounds a bit hackneyed and cliche, but undoubtedly it is the United States and China. And that is going to be the story of the 21st century. It is the the competition for technology dominance between these two superpowers. So, talk to me, Nina, and thank you for for that overview. If you if you talk to CEO Jensen Huang, he would say that the current work of the U.S. and the Trump administration to curb China's excellence on AI is not the right approach. He sees the current chip curbs as something that could potentially benefit the likes of Huawei going forward. What is the right approach then? Uh if the Trump administration were to call you and ask for your input on the right approach to winning on AI, what would you say? Absolutely. So the first thing to say about the Trump administration is just how interesting it is since Trump 2.0 came into office, how much they've kind of identified AI and technology dominance as a priority for the administration. And of course, the export controls started in 2018. But we've seen how if you look at where each superpower, each has its Achilles heel. And I would say that for the United States, the Achilles heel is the lack of the industrial base which China has. We've already heard from your former guests how the infrastructure, the energy requirements, the kind of rare earth materials are absolutely essential to kind of scaling artificial intelligence. So if that is the US's Achilles heel, the Achilles heel for China is compute. But of course, ever since these export controls have come into place in 2018, it's kind of leading to this incubation of innovation in China that was kind of the deep seek moment, just because of how efficient Deep Seek, this AI lab which apparently came out of nowhere, was at running inference, you know, 96% more efficient than the kind of US labs were doing. So there is an argument that by enforcing these export controls, you are just incubating this extreme innovation. Just today, we've had news from Huawei, um, uh, and of course there's also Baidu, that eventually, and by the way, that is the stated ambition of the Chinese government, that they will have semiconductor sovereignty. So this will continue to play out, but I think the fundamental thing is that each of the superpowers has its Achilles heel. For China, it's still compute, um, and for the US, it's its industrial base, starting with energy production. And Nina, my guest host Steve has a question as well. Hi, Nina. My question my question is, if it's this duopoly between the US and China, where does this leave Europe and the rest of Asia? Or even Africa for that matter? It's a great question. I think this is the new world order where the competition is between the two superpowers. And each of the other regions is going to become a swing state or be aligned with one of the superpowers. That's why it was so interesting to see, uh, what President Trump did just the other week on his great tour of the Gulf, where he signed these mega deals with the UAE, with Saudi, with Qatar, you know, almost to the value of $3 trillion. All of those deals have to do with AI infrastructure, with selling AI services, including Nvidia services by the way, to the Gulf. So you see the kind of this great realigning of the Gulf with the United States. And you would think that Europe actually should be a third contender in this race, but actually they have a systemic disadvantage which neither the US nor China has, and that's that it's a block, right, of 27 countries. It's very hard to have a cohesive industrial policy, very hard to have a cohesive um energy policy. And even though they have the talent and lots of capital, they cannot deploy as fast or on the scale that you're seeing between the US and China. So right now, I say you see the US and China leading. Europe a little bit astray, also because it is an ally to the United States under the Trump administration. And really interesting moves where you see the entire Gulf now, thanks to the value of these tremendous deals being signed with the Trump administration, kind of lining up with the United States. And of course, that will have caused consternation in Beijing because Beijing has been doing this and for for a long time, you know, under the kind of the Belt and Road initiative, where they've had the foresight to understand that infrastructure is going to be a form of both hard and soft power going forward. Nina, really appreciate your time this morning. Thank you so much for that context. Thank you.",

Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after a U.S. court ruling struck down President Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs and Nvidia posted record revenue.Nasdaqfutures are 1.4% higher after the tech-focused index slipped by 0.5% in the prior session asstocks fellahead of Nvidia's earnings report.S&P 500futures are up about 1% in early trading whileDow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are 0.4% higher. Bitcoin(BTCUSD) is rising to trade near $109,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is up at around 4.51%. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are little changed. A federal court late Wednesday struck down the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on the country's trading partners in early April, saying he had overstepped his authority.A three-judge panel at theU.S. Court of International Trade ruledthat Congress is typically responsible for imposing these levies and not the president alone. The ruling stopped Trump from enforcing the tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China that were aimed at combating fentanyl entering the U.S. Thesteel and aluminumtariffs Trump imposed in March weren't mentioned in the ruling. The White House immediately appealed the ruling, per reports. Nvidia (NVDA) shares arejumping 6% in premarket tradingafter the chipmaker's first-quarter revenuerose to a record high, even as profit missed analysts' expectations because of export curbs.Nvidia reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share onrevenue that jumped 69%year-over-year to $44.06 billion. While its quarterly sales exceeded analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, its profit did not, as Nvidia said it absorbed a $4.5 billion charge due to restrictions on the sale of its H20 chips to China. In the current quarter, Nvidia expects to take an $8 billion hit due to lost revenue from H20 sales. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said in a post on his social media site X that his time at the helm of theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)has ended.Theannouncementcomes after he said earlier this week that he would return to \"spending 24/7 at work\" after investors had raised questions over whether the government position was distracting his focus from Tesla and his other companies.Musk announced in Aprilthat he would spend less time on work related to DOGE. Tesla shares are up more than 2% in premarket trading. Salesforce (CRM) on Wednesday reported first-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations andlifted its full-year outlook. The cloud software giant raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 revenue and adjusted EPS, citing demand for its AI products. Salesforce reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.58 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year rise to $9.83 billion, both above Visible Alpha consensus. Salesforce shares, which entered Thursday down 17% this year, are little changed in premarket trading.",

Analysts had expected a loss of $0.28 per share on $3.20 billion in revenue, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Kohl's reported a comparable store sales decline of 3.9%, slightly smaller than the 4.0% drop analysts had expected.

        "content": "Investors who have embraced the \"buy the dip\" strategy in 2025 have been handsomely rewarded, with the S&P 500 delivering its strongest post-pullback returns in over three decades. According to research from Bespoke Investment Group, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 0.36% in the trading session following a down day so far in 2025, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. The only year with a comparable performance was 2020, which saw a 0.32% average post-dip gain. A recent example came on May 27, 2025 when the S&P 500 surged more than 2% after falling 0.7% in the final session before the holiday weekend. The rally was sparked by President Trump\u2019s decision to scale back huge previously threatened tariffs on EU \u2014a recurring catalyst behind many of 2025\u2019s rebound rallies. Below we highlight a few factors that could boost Wall Street ETFs higher ahead. On May 28 evening, a panel of judges from the US Court of International Trade ruled against key elements of Trump's trade agenda. The court struck down global tariffs imposed under emergency powers, calling them unlawful. While the decision is a setback for Trump's policies. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF TrustDIA added 1.1% premarket on May 28, whileSPDR S&P 500 ETFSPY advanced 1.5%,Invesco QQQ TrustQQQ gained 2% andiShares Russell 2000 ETFIWM jumped 1.9%. NVIDIA NVDA beat revenue expectations but missed on adjusted earnings per share (EPS), citing the impact of a US government ban on the sale of its H20 chips to China. The company warned it could lose as much as $8 billion in sales next quarter due to the restrictions. Despite this, NVIDIA\u2019s stock surged 6.3% in premarket trading on May 28. During the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang criticized the US chip curbs, arguing they incentivize innovation among Chinese competitors and undermine the U.S. position. \u201cChina\u2019s AI moves on with or without US chips,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe question is whether one of the world\u2019s largest AI markets will run on American platforms.\u201d NVIDIA\u2019s performance gave Wall Street renewed hope that major tech companies can weather the uncertainties surrounding Trump\u2019s trade measures, even as export restrictions create new challenges. While the tech sector is still recovering from a pullback in February\u2014triggered in part by market reactions to low-cost AI DeepSeek\u2014this hasn't derailed investor optimism. Instead, the pullback caused some valuation corrections and set the stage for renewed focus on U.S. tech leadership and AI investment. According to Bank of America, the current earnings cycle confirms that hyperscalers are continuing with their AI investment strategies, even if capex growth is moderating slightly (read: Why Big Tech ETFs Still Remain Great Bets). Retail participation has been a major force behind the renewed strength in Wall Street. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Yahoo Finance that their customers bought heavily during April. \u201cBuy the dip\u201d has been working for them for the past few years. Since the market\u2019s most recent bottom on April 8, the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 19%. JPMorgan quantitative strategist Emma Wu reported that retail investors poured over $50 billion into U.S. equities from April 8 onward\u2014surpassing the $46 billion seen between March and June 2020, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. The week following Trump\u2019s April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcementsaw record dip-buying flows, including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3\u2014the largest single-day retail buying total since VandaTrack began tracking such data in 2014. Total Q1 earnings for the 477 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +11.4% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues, with 74.2% beating EPS estimates and 62.9% beating revenue estimates, per Earnings Trend. However, trade tensions have weighed on estimates so far. Note that total S&P 500 earnings for the June quarter are expected to be up only +5.5% year over year on +3.8% higher revenues, with a broader and greater pressure on estimates relative to other recent periods. Q2 earnings estimates for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors are down since the quarter got underway, with Aerospace as only exception. The Tech sector\u2019s estimates are down since the start of the period, but they have notably stabilized in recent weeks. Against this backdrop, court ruling may brighten the scenario. Despite a short-term market boost, long-term uncertainty over Trump\u2019s tariffs continues to weigh on business confidence. Note that Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling. Companies are delaying hiring, investment, and wage decisions, while investors shift to short-term strategies amid policy volatility. The lack of clarity threatens broader economic growth and keeps the Fed in a wait-and-see mode.   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "May 29- Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said Thursday that Chinese AI firms are rapidly advancing to fill the gap left by U.S. exits, according to a ThursdayBloombergTelevision interview. He singled out Huawei Technologies as quite formidable in developing AI capabilities. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Huang noted that recent U.S. export restrictions have effectively blocked Nvidia from China's vast chip market. He estimated these measures have already cost the company about $15 billion in revenue and will shave roughly $8 billion off second-quarter sales. He warned that losing access to what he described as a nearly $50 billion AI accelerator market could benefit global competitors. Despite this, Huang said Nvidia is exploring limited avenues to remain active under the new rules, although details remain scant. The CEO also emphasized that countries worldwide view AI infrastructure as critical, likening its importance to electricity and the internet. He pointed to growing sovereign investments in AI projects in regions such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. Looking ahead, Huang suggested Nvidia will continue to innovate around export challenges to maintain its leadership in AI computing, even as geopolitical tensions reshape industry dynamics.

        "content": "May 29 -Nvidia has issued a revenue forecast of approximately $45 billion for its fiscal second quarter, acknowledging an anticipated$8 billionimpact due to U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips to China. Despite this significant challenge, the company's outlook remains robust, reflecting strong global demand for its AI technologies. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. For the fiscal first quarter, Nvidia posted $44 billion in revenue, up 69% year-on-year, and adjusted earnings of $0.81 per share. Data center sales led the way at $39 billion, a 73% increase, driven by rapid adoption of Blackwell GPUs and growing AI inference workloads. CFO Colette Kress said the Blackwell NVL72 ramp was the fastest in company history and that networking revenue climbed 64% sequentially to $5 billion. Spectrum-X now annualizes over $8 billion in sales, with major cloud customers on board. Gaming revenue hit $3.8 billion, up 48% from the prior quarter, while automotive and robotics reached $567 million, up 72% year-on-year. Kress warned that losing access to China's AI accelerator market, expected to approach $50 billion, could benefit non-U.S. rivals. CEO Jensen Huang noted that sovereign investments in AI infrastructure continue to accelerate worldwide. Looking ahead, Nvidia expects modest sequential growth across all platforms and gross margins to improve toward the mid-70 percent range later this year. Based on the one year price targets offered by 51 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $163.77 with a high estimate of $235.92 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +21.48% from the current price of $134.81.

Goldberg warns that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Nvidia's main chip fabricator, has maxed out capacity, limiting further upside. He also flags ongoing trade policy volatility under President Trump, including new licensing rules on Nvidia's H20 chip exports to China, which forced the company to warn of a potential $5.5 billion inventory writedown. Goldberg argues that chaotic U.S. semiconductor policy is hurting long-term planning and that investors are underestimating risks tied to global supply chains and government regulation. Instead, Goldberg favors Broadcom (AVGO,Financials), citing its growing role in helping hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google build custom chipschallenging Nvidia's dominance in AI. He calls the AI chip race a \"two-horse contest\" and believes Broadcom's opportunity is not fully appreciated by Wall Street.

        "header": "After Selling Nvidia, Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Unloaded Another One of Wall Street's Hottest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks. Is It Time For You to Do the Same?",
        "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller is a billionaire investor who manages capital at his fund, the Duquesne Family Office. Over the past few years, he has made some eyebrow-raising moves related to investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Perhaps the biggest head-scratcher was his sellingNvidiastock when everyone else seemed to be buying. In fairness, though, Druckenmiller has sinceexpressed some regretabout exiting his Nvidia position. While Nvidia has been one of the largest beneficiaries of a bullish AI narrative, it's far from the only growth stock out there. Ironically, however, Druckenmiller just dumped his fund's entire stake in yet another scorching hot AI stock. Will Druckenmiller come to regret this decision, too? I don't think so. Read on to find out which AI darling the Duquesne Family Office just exited, and learn why I think this was a savvy decision. According to its most recent13F filing, the Duquesne Family Office has completely exited its position inPalantir Technologies(PLTR0.28%). In the table below, I've summarized Druckenmiller's exposure to Palantir stock over the last year. Data source: 13f.info. Per the data above, it appears that the majority of Duquesne's exposure to Palantir was trimmed in the middle of last year. Over the last six months, Druckenmiller's fund held a small position in Palantir stock -- enjoying record gains as the company remained one of the best-performing stocks across theS&P 500andNasdaq-100indices. It begs the question: Why sell now? Image source: Getty Images. Since going public in 2020,Palantir stock has gained well over 1,000%. That's an unusually high return in this short a time duration. However, looking at Palantir's parabolic rise through this lens is a bit misleading. The reason I say that is because the majority of gains in the stock have actually occurred over the last 18 months. When you look at it that way, it becomes even more questionable just how much further the stock can run right now.  PLTR PS Ratiodata byYCharts. In the graph above, I've benchmarked Palantir's valuation against a peer set of high-growth software stocks on aprice-to-sales(P/S) basis. Not only is Palantir the obvious outlier here, but just look at how muchexpansion its valuation multipleshave experienced over the last year relative to its peers. As of the closing bell on May 23, Palantir boasted a market capitalization of $291 billion -- considerably more thanSalesforce(whichI predictedwould happen), despite being a much smaller, less diversified, and less profitable business. In my eyes, Druckenmiller isn't going to roll the dice on any more momentum fueling Palantir. I think he decided to take his gains and redeploy capital intomore appropriately valued businesses. One of the secrets to investing is that there is neverreallya perfect time tosell a stock. What I would point out about Palantir's valuation right now is that itsP/S multiple is more than doublethe levels thatAmazonandCiscopeaked at during the dot-com bubble, and considerably higher than where Nvidia reached throughout the AI revolution. I bring this up because as sobering as it may be to realize, even the hottest growth stocks experience pullbacks from time to time. As Palantir stock continues to rocket higher, I suspect expectations will rise around its quarterly earnings results. This presents a risk in that Palantir could deliver a monster earnings report, but ultimately fail to live up to unjustifiably lofty expectations -- hence, the stock could drop off a cliff instantly. While I remain a long-term bull, I wouldn't blame investors who trim their Palantir positions right now. One prudent approach could be to sell enough to at least recoup your initial investment. Another strategy could be to collect some gains if you're up by 15% or more on your position (essentially double the long-runaverage annual return of the S&P 500).",

Investors are cheering Nvidia's (NVDA)first quarter earnings report, despite concerns about China still weighing on the company. A new reading on first quarter GDP shows theUS economy contracted0.2% in the first quarter. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere. Let\u2019s get to the three things that you need to know today. First up, stocks jumping this morning after US courts struck down President Trump\u2019s tariffs, declaring them illegal. The ruling could eliminate new tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, as well as President Trump\u2019s Liberation Day so-called reciprocal tariffs. The Trump administration immediately said it would appeal the ruling, putting the fate of the tariffs in the hands of an appellate court and potentially the Supreme Court. Plus, the other big focus for investors this morning, Nvidia. Shares jumping in pre-market trading after the company offered an upbeat sales forecast, easing investor concerns about a slowdown in China. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry. China's AI moves on with or without US chips. The company expects revenue of about $45 billion in the second quarter fiscal year. And meanwhile, new export restrictions will cost Nvidia about $8 billion in Chinese revenue during the period. But the forecast still met analyst estimates. And the latest read on the economy coming in better than expected still showing an economic contraction of two-tenths of a percent for the first quarter. Second read on quarter one GDP coming in better than the initial report, but still shrinking amid weaker consumer spending and a surge in imports.",

        "header": "Diversify or Risk Running Dry: 12 Additional Income Streams For Your Retirement",
        "content": "According to a recent survey by Northwestern Mutual, people believe they\u2019ll need around $1.26 million in order to retire comfortably.The million-dollar question (so to speak) is where, exactly, will all that money come from? Just as it\u2019s important to avoid concentrating too much of your portfolio in one particular investment or asset type, yoursources of incomein retirement should be varied as well\u2014and for similar reasons. A 401(k), for example, is susceptible tomarket volatility. Meanwhile,Social Security paymentswon\u2019t be enough to cover all your needs. Incorporating avariety of income sourcescan help balance risk while addressing your full financial needs in retirement. Let\u2019s look at how retirees can build a robust income strategy in retirement. Your options for generating retirement income aren\u2019t limited to traditional savings or investment vehicles. Here are 12 potential income sources you might want to consider incorporating into your retirement income plan. Some investments, including REITS and certain dividend-paying stocks, will pay investors a percentage of the profits on a regular basis (typically quarterly). The exact amount each investor receives will depend on how many shares are owned and how much profit the company earned over the previous quarter. If you own 200 shares and the company announces a $1 per share dividend payout, for example, you could expect to receive $50 individend payoutsfor the quarter or $200 in total dividend payouts for the year. While the actual payout amount will vary based on market and company performance, incorporating dividend-producing investments into your retirement portfolio can help supplement your other sources of retirement income. Retirees may also appreciate the steadier, stable nature of dividend stocks, which have historically experienced less volatility than equity investments\u2014though the tradeoff for less risk is lower potential returns. If you think of life insurance as a way to financially protect your loved ones from early death, consider annuities as a way to protect against an unexpectedly long life. Annuities are common tools used by retirees to create guaranteed, lifelong income in retirement. It\u2019s essentially a contract between you and an insurance company, in which you pay an initial lump-sum payment in exchange for future (or sometimes immediate) monthly premium payouts. Some annuities may be bought with monthly payments as well\u2014as opposed to a lump-sum amount. Annuities come in many shapes and sizes, which will determine how much you receive over time. For example, some annuities may invest in the market while providing critical downside protection. In exchange, they often limit the upside potential. Other annuities will provide a guaranteed minimum interest rate and fixed periodic payments, which may offer more reliability but little opportunity for growth. If you\u2019re considering obtaining an annuity, read the fine print first. They tend to be complex, incur high fees, and may include certain caveats, like lock-up periods or early withdrawal penalties. Bonds are one of the traditional asset classes alongside equities (stocks) and cash or cash equivalents. In addition to paying back the principal amount after reaching the date of maturity, bonds typically provide investors with a fixed interest rate throughout the bond\u2019s lifetime. Because they offer this steady, fixed income, they\u2019re often considered an essential component of a diversified retirement income strategy. If you have awhole life insurancepolicy with a cash value, you may be able to withdraw a portion of that cash value to use as income in retirement. As long as what you withdraw doesn\u2019t exceed what you\u2019ve already paid into the policy, your withdrawals may even be tax-free. If you withdraw earnings or growth within the account, however, your withdrawals will likely be subject toordinary income tax. While your insurance policy\u2019s cash value can serve as a source of income in retirement, it\u2019s not without its drawbacks. Namely, what you withdraw from the cash value will be deducted from your beneficiary\u2019s death benefits. For most retirees, the death benefits are the reason they have a life insurance policy in the first place. Whole life insurance policies also tend to come with high premiums and fees. If your end goal is to generate income in retirement (as opposed to leaving a large death benefit for surviving loved ones), you can do so using brokerage accounts or retirement accounts with fewer fees. Defined benefit pension plansare becoming increasingly rare, though some employers (like the government, school districts, and certain unionized jobs) still offer them. If your employer offers a pension plan, this is certainly an advantage for your retirement income strategy. Similar to an annuity, plan participants will generally have the option to either receive fixed monthly payments or a lump-sum payment in retirement. The exact amount you\u2019ll receive depends on a few factors, including how long you were employed and how much you earned. Most employers offer an employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k), 403(b), or Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). Defined contribution (DC) plansare often one of the primary sources of retirement income, and many employers will match employee contributions up to a certain percentage\u2014meaning more free money for retirement. Even if your employer doesn\u2019t match your employee contributions, participants still get a tax advantage. Traditional 401(k)s and other DC plans allow participants to deduct the initial contribution from their taxable income immediately. Anything earned in the account grows tax-deferred, and tax is only collected once withdrawals are made in retirement. Roth plans, like a Roth 401(k), work a little differently. Contributions are not tax-deductible, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Starting at age 62, you\u2019ll be eligible to begin collecting Social Security benefits\u2014as long as you or your spouse paid into the FICA payroll taxes during your working years. If you\u2019re able to delay collecting benefits, it may be worth waiting until full retirement age or longer to start. Full retirement age for most people is 67, though you\u2019ll maximize your monthly benefits if you wait to collect until age 70. Social Security benefits may not provide enough to cover all of your financial needs in retirement, but they do play a critical role in your overall retirement income strategy.Not only are they guaranteed, steady income you\u2019ll receive for life, but they also receive cost-of-living adjustments each year as well. It\u2019s not uncommon for people in retirement to generatepassive incomethrough rental properties. If you live in an especially tourist-friendly area or desirable neighborhood, you may be able to list your property on a short-term rental site and charge a premium for vacation stays. Or, you may enjoy the steadier pace of a long-term rental, which offers more income reliability and less tenant turnover. In either case, rental income is one way to create income in retirement that\u2019s not dependent on market performance. Plus, you own a tangible asset that may, eventually, be sold for a tidy profit. Home values have increased in recent years, meaning your family\u2019s home may have accumulated significant value over time. In certain circumstances, it may make sense to tap into some of that equity as a way to supplement your retirement income. Ahome equity line of credit(HELOC) enables you to essentially borrow against the value of your home. At times when your portfolio is hit hard by market volatility, for example, it may be unwise to make withdrawals. A HELOC could help you cover temporary income gaps while preserving more of your portfolio long-term. Unlike a traditional mortgage, you do not make monthly payments to a lender with areverse mortgage. Rather, the lender pays you instead, using your home as collateral. Here\u2019s another way to think about it: Instead of paying down a balance, you\u2019re building up a loan balance based on the amount paid out, plus interest and fees. The monthly payments you receive from your reverse mortgage are yours to use as you please\u2014which is why this special type of loan is geared towards those living in retirement. Payment for the loan will be due once you are no longer living in the home. Typically, the retiree or their heirs will sell the home and use the funds to pay back the balance of the loan. You have many options for earning passive income in retirement, including collecting royalties. If you produce artwork, music, patents, or other intellectual property, you may be able to sell the rights to your work and receive royalties in return. If you\u2019re not quite ready to say goodbye to your working years, you could continue earning money in retirement by freelancing, picking up a part-time job, or starting a business. Depending on your skills and interests, you may have little overhead or initial upfront costs for getting started\u2014making this an even more appealing option for retirees. Not every income stream will be right for everyone in retirement. For example,Quentara Costa, CFP, founder of POWWOW, LLC, cautioned retirees about the time and energy commitment of owning an investment property. \u201cManaging a second property, especially one intended for rental, is often more complicated and time-consuming than people anticipate.\u201d She continued, \u201cToday\u2019s real estate market makes it hard for the average investor to generate consistent, passive income when balanced against the cost of maintaining the property and losing access to the equity.\u201d When considering what income streams fit your retirement income goals,Aaron Terwedoof TFS Advisors reminded retirees about the importance of pursuing options with varying tax treatments. \u201cDiversifying income sources is a similar concept to diversifying your investments, and having diversification in income allows you to possibly tax-plan to give less money to the IRS.\u201d He explained that, ultimately, a retiree\u2019s income should fall into three tax buckets: tax-free, capital asset (meaning it\u2019s taxed as a capital gain), or ordinary income asset (taxed as ordinary income). Terwedo says other factors to consider when choosing income streams for retirement include: \u201cRetirement isn\u2019t just about how much you\u2019ve saved,\u201d explained Costa. \u201cIt\u2019s also about how efficiently you can withdraw that money. Plus, the tax diversification gives you options when facing an unpredictable future tax landscape.\u201d In addition to managing your tax liability in retirement, varying your income sources better enables you to accomplish different goals while protecting against certain risks (market risk, inflation risk, health care risk, etc.).  Examples of your retirement income goals might include:  No one single source of income will likely provide enough to meet your needs entirely. For that reason, diversifying income sources is key. As of April 2025, the average monthly Social Security retirement check for a retiree is $1,911.The estimated average does, however, change monthly. There is no magic number you need to have saved in order to enjoy retirement. However, some experts suggest basing your retirement savings goal on your current salary. For example, T. Rowe Price found that investors should aim to have between 6 and 11 times their salary saved by age 60 in order to be on track for retirement. By age 65, that number should increase to between 7.5 and 13.5 times your salary today. You can use anonline retirement calculatorto estimate how much you\u2019ll need to meet your financial obligations in retirement. These calculators will use factors including your current age, existing savings, salary, monthly savings contributions, anticipated retirement spending, historical market data, and more to determine how much you\u2019ll need to sustain your lifestyle in retirement. The exact amount of money you need to enjoy retirement will depend on a number of personal factors. Whether you have a few years or a few months until it\u2019s time to leave work behind for good, it\u2019s never too early to make a plan, research your income options, and consider the most tax-efficient way to cover your needs in retirement.",

        "header": "Why Keeping Growth in Your Portfolio After 70 Is Crucial for Your Financial Health",
        "content": "Many retirees adopt a conservative investment strategy to help ensure they have enough income to support themselves. The \u201c100 minus age\u201d rule, a popular guideline, suggests subtracting your age from 100 to determine what percentage of your portfolio should be invested in stocks. But with life expectancies rising, many experts recommend more growth-oriented formulas, like 110 or even 125 minus age.In other words, exposure to growth assets is becoming increasingly important for outpacing inflation and maintaining your lifestyle. Let\u2019s explore howproper asset allocationcan help you strike the right balance between income and growth after 70. Asset allocationrefers to how you divide your investments amongasset classes, primarily including stocks, bonds, and cash or cash equivalents. The ratio between these categories is one of the most significant determinants of your portfolio\u2019s risk and return profile, as each asset class has distinct advantages and drawbacks: As you move through different life stages, yourideal asset allocationusually shifts. When you\u2019re younger, you can often afford to focus on growth and maximizing returns since you have plenty of time to recover from market downturns. Once you approach retirement, you have less time to ride out volatility. By your 70s,achieving optimal asset allocationis less about maximizing returns and more about preserving your savings so they can support your day-to-day life. Someone in their 20s might pursue anaggressive portfolio, with 80%\u2013100% stocks, 0%\u201310% bonds, and 0%\u201310% cash and equivalents. Someone in their 70s might adopt aconservative portfolio, with 60%\u201365% in bonds, 25%\u201330% in stocks, and 5%\u201315% in cash and equivalents. Retirees often prioritize low-risk, income-producing assets, but avoiding growth investments entirely can be a big mistake. A portfolio focused solely on stability may not generate high enough returns to sustain your lifestyle, especially if you encounter a poorsequence of returnsearly in retirement or highinflation. Without some exposure to growth, the risk of outliving your savings becomes very real. \u201cOverly conservative portfolios early in retirement can struggle to keep up with inflation and reduce long-term financial flexibility,\u201d said Melody Townsend, CFP, founder ofTownsend Financial Planning. \u201cThe key is to balance appropriate risk with realistic income planning\u2014not to eliminate growth altogether.\u201d With people living longer than ever, this balancing act has become increasingly delicate. While life expectancy dipped briefly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the broader trend has been upward for decades. According to the latest Social Security Administration (SSA) data, about 30% of U.S. men will live to age 85, and around 10% of women will reach age 95.Even at 70, many retirees need their savings to last 15 to 25 years. One of the most popular and effective strategies for balancing growth and income in retirement is thebucket strategy. Recommended by Townsend andCharles Petitjean, CFP, it involves dividing your portfolio into \u201cbuckets\u201d based on when you need the funds. For example, according to Petitjean, you might separate your portfolio into the following three buckets: \u201cThe short-term bucket would be invested very conservatively, such as in a combination of cash, money market funds, and short-term bond funds,\u201d Petitjean said. \u201cThe intermediate-term bucket might hold core bond funds with longer maturities and yield a higher annual return. Finally, the long-term bucket should be invested more aggressively, with investments such as U.S. and international stock funds.\u201d \u201cThis allows retirees to draw income without being forced to sell growth investments during down markets,\u201d Townsend said. As a result, you canweather market volatilitywith greater confidence, knowing your near-term needs are protected even if long-term investments temporarily lose value. In addition to managing your asset allocation manually, you can use certainmutual funds and ETFsdesigned to help you achieve your desired mix more automatically. Some of the most popular examples include: Target-date and balanced funds aim to balance growth potential and income stability within a single fund, but growth and income funds must be paired together to strike that balance. While these asset allocation funds offer convenience, they may lack the precision necessary to adapt to your evolving needs. \u201cThey tend to be a good starting point for younger investors who are focused on accumulating for simplicity\u2019s sake,\u201d Petitjean said, \u201cbut they\u2019re not personalized and can be somewhat of a black box.\u201d For retirees, that lack of customization can be a significant drawback. \u201cBalanced/income funds might work for some, but I usually recommend customizing allocation based on the retiree\u2019s full financial picture,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cOff-the-shelf funds have the potential to oversimplify what is usually a very personal decision.\u201d Because each asset class will grow at different and unpredictable rates, your portfolio will naturally drift from your target allocation. The process of realigning your investments with your ideal mix is calledrebalancing. It involves selling off excess assets in one area and using the proceeds to bolster lagging positions in others. For example, say your target allocation is 60% stocks and 40% bonds. After a strong year in the stock market, equities might grow to represent 70% of your portfolio. Rebalancing would involve selling stocks and buying bonds to bring your ratio back in line and achieve your desired mix of growth and income. \u201cRebalancing is important for everyone, but it becomes even more important in retirement,\u201d Petitjean said. \u201cNot only does it help to keep the portfolio in line with its predefined target, but it also provides an opportunity to buy low and sell high.\u201d Beyond asset allocation, here are some other effective ways to protect your portfolio in retirement. Dividing your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents reduces your risk of suffering catastrophic losses, but truediversificationtakes this idea further. It involves building variety within each category, such as holding stocks across different sectors, industries, or regions. When you hold individual investments that react differently to stimuli, you minimize your portfolio\u2019s exposure to any one risk, helping to smooth out its performance. For example, if thetech sectortakes a hit, having exposure to thehealth care sectormay cushion the blow to the stock portion of your portfolio. You may not think oftax planningas a risk management strategy, but taxes represent one of the more significant threats to your retirement savings. \u201cSome of the most overlooked forms of risk in retirement aren\u2019t market-related; they\u2019re tax-related,\u201d Petitjean said. Instead of waiting to meet with your accountant until it\u2019s time to file a return, consult with them proactively throughout each year. Petitjean and Townsend emphasized the importance of a long-term strategy to minimize your lifetime tax liability. \u201cI am shocked by how many consumers only talk to their tax professional after the tax year has already closed,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cIt is impossible to properly strategize by being reactive with taxes.\u201d Proactive tax planning allows you to execute more sophisticated and potentially lucrative strategies. \u201cFor example, I often encourage retirees in their 60s and early 70s to considerpartial Roth conversions,\u201d Petitjean said. Roth conversionsinvolve transferring funds from a pre-tax retirement account into a Roth IRA. You must pay taxes on the amount transferred in the year you execute the conversion, but you can then withdraw it tax-free from yourRoth IRAin retirement. Roth conversions can help you save by paying taxes on withdrawals while you\u2019re in lower tax brackets. \u201cThese can be especially powerful in the years before forced income begins in the form of Social Security, pension income, andrequired minimum distributions (RMDs),\u201d said Petitjean. Emotional decision-making\u2014especiallypanic sellingduring a downturn\u2014can devastate your retirement savings. An investor who put $10,000 in the S&P 500 in 1995 would have $224,278 in 2024 if they stayed fully invested the whole time, but just $102,750\u2014roughly 54% less\u2014if they took their money out of the market during that period\u2019s 10 best days. One of the best ways to avoid this mistake is to set up a system that removes emotion from the equation byautomating your portfolio withdrawals. \u201cMost consumers love building the income stream to come in each month, like they are still getting a paycheck from their employer,\u201d said Townsend. Many major brokerages offer automated solutions that can help. Schwab\u2019s Intelligent Income feature allows you to create recurring monthly distributions from a Schwab Intelligent Portfolio. Similarly, the Fidelity Retirement Income Planner is an interactive tool for developing and automating a withdrawal strategy. With so many moving parts in retirement, partnering with aqualified professionalwho understands the full financial picture can be one of the best ways to maximize your resources. Not only can they help you navigate complex situations, but they can also help make managing your money a more passive experience. That way, you can spend your golden years relaxing rather than working in a spreadsheet. Theaverage retiree\u2019s investment balancevaries by age. Americans aged 55 to 64 have an average of $537,560 in retirement accounts. Those between 65 and 75 average around $609,230. Individuals 75 or older average $462,410. However, average doesn't necessarily mean typical. Themedianretirement investment account balances for these age groups are $185,000 (ages 55 to 64), $200,000 (ages 65 to 75), and $130,000 (age 75 and higher). Toprotect your portfolio from inflation, you should maintain some exposure to growth-oriented investments, like stocks. Keeping your cash in high-yield savings accounts or low-risk money market funds can also help preserve purchasing power. There\u2019s no universal rule, but experts often recommend rebalancing at least once a year, if not semi-annually or quarterly. The right frequency depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Because yourinvestment time horizonshrinks as you age, asset allocation becomes even more important in retirement. After 70, your focus often shifts from maximizing returns to generating reliable income, but growth investments remain vital. Some exposure is still necessary to stay ahead of inflation and maintain your lifestyle, especially with life expectancy increasing. One of the best ways to balance growth and income is through the bucket strategy and regular rebalancing. Financial advisors can help you implement these and other risk management strategies, like advanced diversification, proactive tax planning, and automating withdrawals.",

        "content": "Sixty-six percent ofmillennials fear running out of moneymore than death, according to a study from the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement. And millennials are hardly alone in this fear. Seventy percent ofGen Xersand 61% ofbaby boomersare more scared of running out of money than death. Survey respondent blamed highinflation, hightaxes,Social Securitynot offering enough financial support, andmarket volatilityfor their worries about running out of money. These are some strategies experts recommend to help ensure you have enough money for retirement. One way to maximize money in retirement is to delaySocial Security benefits. \u201cDelaying Social Security can significantly boost your monthly income, and waiting until age 70 can increase your benefit by 8% per year beyondfull retirement age, which is 67 for most people,\u201d saysPriya Malani, founder of Stash Wealth. \u201cYour benefits are adjusted annually for inflation throughCOLA (cost-of-living adjustments), which helps preserve your purchasing power over time.\u201d To start, millennials will want to invest a good share of their savings in the stock market to take advantage of the power ofcompoundingreturns on their investments. \u201cFor anyone afraid of running out of money, the most powerful thing you can do is focus on your own savings rate and getting a healthy portion of the money you save\u00a0invested into long-term growth assets,\u201d said Eric Roberge, acertified financial planner (CFP)and founder ofBeyond Your Hammock. Next, millennials will want todiversifytheir investments. This will help them stay on track with their investing goals, such as retirement. \u201cBy spreading your money across different asset classes, industries, and even parts of the world, you\u2019re not putting all your eggs in one basket. So when one area of the market dips, other areas can help cushion the blow,\u201d Malani said. Establish abudgetand stick to it, making room for items such as emergency savings and long-term goals such as saving for retirement. \u201cMaintain anemergency fundor some kind of cash reserve that you can easily access,\u201d Roberge said. \u201cKeep expenses much lower than you could technically afford, and create a gap between what you earn and what you spend.\u201d \u201cSave more than you think you need. Invest 20 to 25% of yourgross incometo\u00a0meet your\u00a0long-term financial goals like retirement,\u201d Roberge said. ARoth individual retirement accountis a good place for millennials\u2019retirementsavings. \u201cA Roth IRA is one of the smartest tools millennials can use to build long-term, tax-free wealth, especially while you\u2019re still in a relatively lowertax bracket,\u201d Malani says. \u201cWith a Roth, you pay taxes now, your money grows tax-free, and you withdraw it tax-free in retirement. That\u2019s a huge win, especially considering tax rates in the future are anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d Many millennials fear running out of money, as do many Gen Xers and baby boomers. Taking a proactive approach with finances is the best way to fight the fear of running out of money. Start by being wise about budgeting, spending, and saving. Next, consider the tax advantages of a Roth IRA and invest some of your retirement savings in these accounts. Diversify your investments and consider waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits.",

The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, giving up most of its earlier gains. TheDowrose 0.15% and theNasdaqgained 0.4%.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped more than 6% in early trading on Thursday, adding more than $200 billion to the company\u2019s market value and pushing the company's market cap to $3.49 trillion, edging out Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) $3.41 trillion value.\u00a0Nvidia stock gave up ground throughout the day, and Microsoft ultimately overtook the AI chip giant in market value by Thursday's close.

        "header": "Retired? Here's 5 Reasons You Still Need an Emergency Fund\u2014Plus How Much It Should Cover",
        "content": "Planning for retirement means focusing on investment strategies and your possible income sources, such as Social Security or a retirement account. However, one very important element of retirement that is often overlooked is maintaining an adequate emergency fund to cover any unexpected expenses that may come your way during retirement. Anemergency fundis a savings account specifically used to cover unexpected expenses or financial emergencies, such as medical expenses, home repairs, or a loss of income. The general rule of thumb whenbuilding an emergency fundis to save enough money to cover three to six months of expenses. Retirees, however, should consider keeping more money stowed away in emergency savings, especially if they are living on a fixed income, like Social Security. Entering retirement brings on a new set of financial circumstances that will make having an emergency fund extra important. \u201cRetirees often face higher and more unpredictable expenses, such as health care costs and home repairs, without the safety net of a regular paycheck,\u201d explainedJake Falcon, founder and CEO of Falcon Wealth Advisors. \u201cHaving a larger emergency fund provides a buffer to cover theseunexpected expensesand helps maintain financial stability during retirement.\u201d Life\u2019s surprises don\u2019t stop when you retire. Major home repairs, replacing an old vehicle, and unexpected family or medical needs can come up without any warning. Jason Fannon, CFP and senior partner at Cornerstone Financial Services identified the most commonsurprise expenses: \u201cThe most common surprise expenses for retirees are medical (including dental, as many don't have dental insurance), housing (roof, driveway, basement flooded, furnace, A/C, hot water tank, HOA assessments), and auto related costs (old vehicle is failing, new tires, repairs).\u201d Without an emergency fund, these expenses may force you to tap into your retirement investments sooner than you planned, possibly during a downturned market. Retirees who rely on investment portfolios for their sole income will face the risk of a possible market downturn. Having a fully funded emergency fund provides an important financial buffer throughmarket volatility, meaning you can avoid selling your investments at a lower price to cover your basic living expenses. This protection is becoming more and more important as pensions are becoming increasingly rare, making retirees more dependent on market-based retirement accounts. Health care costs often increase with age and can be highly unpredictable. Even withMedicare coverage, out-of-pocket costs for serious illnesses, specialized treatments, or long-term care needs can quickly go beyond your planned budget. Falcon pointed out several health-related scenarios that make an emergency fund crucial, including \u201chealth care costs\u2014even with Medicare, retirees may face significant out-of-pocket expenses for prescriptions, co-pays, and non-covered services.\u201d Without any liquid (cash) savings, emergencies might force retirees to turn to credit cards or personal loans. Accruing debt during retirement can be particularly dangerous, as limited income makes it more difficult to pay down debt balances quickly. Perhaps one of the most underrated benefits of an emergency fund is themental peace of mindthat comes with knowing you can handle any financial surprise that comes your way without derailing your retirement plan orbudget. Determining what size emergency fund is right for you requires balancing several retirement-specific factors, including your lifestyle, monthly expenses, and your overall financial situation going into retirement. Start by calculating your essential monthly expenses, including the cost of housing, food, utilities, health care, and transportation. This baseline number will help you determine your minimum monthly needs during an emergency. Jake Falcon advised that \u201cretirees should determine the amount needed in their emergency fund by evaluating their monthly expenses and considering potential unexpected costs. This includes regular living expenses such as housing, utilities, food, and transportation, as well as health care costs,insurance premiums, and any debt payments.\u201d Take into account the stability of your household retirement income. If you plan to rely heavily on market-based withdrawals rather than a guaranteed fixed income (like pensions or Social Security), you may need a larger emergency fund. \"Emergency funds serve as a supplemental financial resource that interacts with otherretirement income sourcesby providing liquidity and flexibility,\" said Falcon. \"Social Security, pensions, and required minimum distributions (RMDs) offer regular income, but they may not be sufficient to cover unexpected expenses.\" The current health of you and your spouse, as well as family medical history, should play a role in determining how much to set aside in your emergency fund. People with chronic conditions or a family history of serious illnesses may want to set aside additional funds, especially as they get further into retirement. A 65-year-old individual will need an average of $165,000 in savings to cover health care costs in retirement, according to the 2024 Fidelity Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate. Homeowners should factor in potential home repairs and maintenance into their emergency fund. Falcon notes that, \u201cas retirees age, their homes may require more frequent and costly repairs to ensure safety and accessibility.\u201d If you think you may require additional support in your home, or you eventually plan to move into an assisted living facility, you may want to factor this into your emergency fund as well. When asked how many months of savings retirees should maintain, Jason Fannon recommended \u201ckeeping one year's worth of living expenses in a purchased money fund. This allows the retiree to cover unexpected expenses without incurring debt or disrupting investments.\" To take it even further, Falcon added, \u201cOn top of the emergency fund, we like to maintain five years' worth of planned spending not in stocks and instead have those funds allocated to investment-grade bonds.\" Building and maintaining an emergency fund that will support you throughout your retirement requires intentional planning and preparation. If you are approaching retirement without an emergency fund, establishing one as soon as possible should become a top priority. This may require temporarily reducing other spending or investment contributions. Your emergency fund should be easily accessible, but still earn you some form of returns. Fannon suggested \u201ckeeping one year's worth of living expenses in a purchased money fund. This allows the retiree to cover unexpected expenses without incurring debt or disrupting investments. It also provides them with a reasonable rate of return on cash. For example, Schwab U.S. Treasury Money Fund pays nearly 4% and is liquid in one business day.\u201d Other options to consider include: Even in retirement, regular contributions help maintain and grow your emergency fund. Schedule automatic transfers to come out of your primary checking account on the same day as your scheduled income deposit. During retirement, you can direct a portion of any pension or Social Security payments to your emergency fund while building or replenishing your savings. Before tapping into your emergency fund, first exhaust all other options. Determine if the expense is truly an emergency. Setting personal boundaries and guidelines as to what you consider an emergency will help you determine whether you should, or should not, withdraw money from your emergency fund. Before making a withdrawal, first consider if insurance would cover part of or all of the expense. Could the expense be deferred or reduced through negotiations or an interest-free payment plan? Don\u2019t forget to evaluate thetax implicationsof different funding sources before making the decision to withdraw from your emergency fund. After using your emergency fund, Falcon advised: \u201cReplenishing an emergency fund can be done over time through monthly budgeting or a well-thought-out liquidation of assets (stocks or bonds). This should be completed by an investment advisor who has a good grasp on cash flow and tax planning.\u201d Also consider: Falcon highlights additional retirement-specific scenarios that make emergency funds essential: thecost of long-term careand inflation. \u201cThe need for long-term care can arise unexpectedly, and the costs associated with assisted living or nursing home care can be substantial,\u201d said Falcon. Additionally, \u201cthe rising costs of goods and services can erode purchasing power, making it essential to have a financial cushion to cover increased expenses.\u201d Planning for the increased cost of living as you age is another important factor to consider when building and continually reassess your retirement fund. Financial experts generally recommend keeping up to a year or more of essential expenses in your emergency fund, which is more than the typical amount advised for working adults. The larger cushion is necessary because retirees face more uncertainty without regular employment income, as well as higher health care costs. The best place to keep your emergency fund is somewhere where your money is easily accessible, and ideally provides you with safe and reasonable returns. People often choose to put their money in ahigh-yield savings account, which can return anywhere from 3-5%. The safest place to put your money is in an FDIC-insured account at a bank or credit union, like a high-yield savings account, which provides you with returns and quick access to cash. You can also consider a prepaid card or cash, although these options carry a higher risk of being lost, damaged, or stolen. Emergency expenses for retirees often include unexpected medical expenses, urgent home repairs or appliance replacements, crucial vehicle repairs or replacements, or family emergencies that require your financial assistance. An emergency fund is not a luxury, but a necessity inretirement planning. Having a fully funded emergency fund will protect against unexpected expenses and market volatility while offering you peace of mind during your retirement years. Remember that your emergency fund is a personal safety net designed specifically for your life circumstances. As both Fannon and Falcon suggested, working with afinancial advisorcan help you determine the right amount for your situation, taking into account your health, housing, income sources, and overall retirement strategy. By maintaining a fully funded emergency fund, you are protecting the retirement lifestyle you\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve while guaranteeing that unexpected expenses do not turn into financial disasters.",

Nvidia's shares finished the day 3.3% higher. ReadInvestopedia'sfull coverage oftoday's trading here. Nordson (NDSN) shares jumped 6.8%, the most of any stock in the S&P 500, after the maker of industrial adhesives testing equipment topped sales and profit forecasts with its fiscal second-quarter results. Contributions from recent acquisitions and strength in the Advanced Technology Solutions segment, in which Nordson provides its services to electronics manufacturers, helped drive the quarter's results. Shares of credit scoring firm Fair Isaac (FICO) closed 4% higher on Thursday, extending a recovery for the stock. Prior to the bounce, FICO shares had come under heavy pressure since Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, critiqued the prices FICO charges for assessing the credit of potential mortgage borrowers. Barclays boosted its price target on Est\u00e9e Lauder (EL) stock, and shares of the cosmetics company advanced 3.6%. Analysts expressed confidence in CEO St\u00e9phane de La Faverie, who took the helm of the makeup maker at the beginning of this year, highlighting his attentiveness to customer needs, but they stressed that the sustainability of Est\u00e9e Lauder's premium valuation will likely depend on the company driving consistent sales growth in line with its peers. HP (HPQ) shares suffered Thursday's steepest drop in the S&P 500, dropping 8.3% after the computer and printer manufacturer reportedlower-than-expected profitsfor its fiscal second quarter. The company also trimmed its full-year outlook, citing tariff impacts. CEO Enrique Lores noted that HP has increased its prices as it seeks to offset cost pressure.

The seller of flatscreen TVs and other tech gear obtains a significant amount of its products from China and Mexico, two countries that have been targeted by tariffs under the Trump administration. The reduced forecasts came alongside mixed results for Best Buy's fiscal first quarter, with adjusted earnings per share topping estimates but revenue falling short. Shares of networking solutions provider Arista Networks (ANET) fell 6.9%. The losses came after Nvidia touted Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook parent Meta Platform (META) as new clients for Nvidia's own Ethernet network switches. Analysts noted that Meta has traditionally been one of Arista's largest customers, while Nvidia's capacity to bundle products make it a formidable competitor across different components of artificial intelligence data centers.",

The analyst believes that Nvidia\u2019s core business remains solid, driven by \u201cinsatiable demand for inference\u201d across major partners and customers. Nvidia\u2019s $45 billion revenue forecast for Q2 is strong, even though it falls a little short of Wall Street\u2019s $45.8 billion estimate, Kumar cited. The analyst expects Nvidia\u2019s revenue to grow 22% sequentially, excluding the $8 billion impact from China, indicating the fastest growth in the last six quarters.

        "header": "Trading Day: Courting confusion",
        "content": "By Jamie McGeever ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - TRADING DAY Making sense of the forces driving global markets By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist Tariffruling and counter-ruling Tariff confusion reigned on Thursday as investors digested a U.S. trade court ruling late Wednesday against most ofPresident Donald Trump's tariffs. They initially cheered the news, but by the time a U.S. appeals court reinstated the duties just before the Wall Street close, that optimism had largely evaporated. In my column today I look at how structurally higher U.S. borrowing costs in the coming years mean the fiscal 'precipice' Washington faces may be even nearer than it seems. More on that below, but first, a roundup of the main market moves. If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today. 1. U.S. court's tariff ruling gives markets short-term pop,long-term angst 2. Trump's tariff tally: $34 billion and counting, globalcompanies say 3. Trump, Fed's Powell meet at White House, Fed says 4. Nvidia discloses more China risks, but CEO praises Trump 5. Germany's return as world's top creditor may befleeting: Mike Dolan Today's Key Market Moves * Wall Street's rally fades, and benchmark indices end upa maximum of 0.4%. Nvidia shares hit a 4-month high followingthe firm's results and outlook, up 3.2% on the day and 65% fromthe April 7 low. * In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rises nearly2%, its best day in over a month, and Chinese tech stocks climb2.5%. * U.S. Treasury yields fall as much as 5 bps across thecurve, with a 7-year note auction registering strong demand. * Japan's 40-year bond yield slides 21 bps to 3.10%, itslowest in over a month and sharply down from last week's recordhigh 3.675%. * Gold snaps a three-day losing streak, rising nearly 1%to $3,315/oz. Courting confusion As if the fog of uncertainty shrouding markets wasn't thick enough, investors' visibility has been dimmed further by a U.S. court ruling that most of Trump's tariffs are unlawful, followed by an appeals court reinstating them while the appeal process unfolds. The administration will likely find other legal avenues to implement its tariffs if need be, so the net effect may ultimately be minimal. But the ruling and appeal could affect Washington's negotiations with major trade partners, timelines, and how countries play their hand. For investors, the upshot is more uncertainty and less clarity. The latest twists come just as it looked like tariff revenues were beginning to pick up. Donald Schneider at Piper Sandler on social media platform X this week estimated that tariff revenues were coming in at an annualized pace of $255 billion, up from a \"norm\" of about $85 billion, while analysts at UBS on Thursday said tariffs were on track to generate $300-450 billion in annual revenues. Wednesday's court ruling, however, would cut that to below $200 billion. On the other hand, of course, lower tariffs are immediately positive for growth and reduce the likelihood of retaliation from other countries. Senior administration officials downplayed the impact of the trade court block, but it is notable that Trump himself hasn't commented yet. He was busy on Thursday, to be fair. He had a \"meaningful\" telephone call about trade and tariffs with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, then later hosted a private meeting at the White House with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The two discussed growth, employment, and inflation, and Trump reiterated his view that the Fed is making a \"mistake\" by not cutting interest rates. The meeting, their first since 2019, comes a day after Fed minutes underscored exactly why policymakers haven't cut rates - unprecedented uncertainty. Before all that, investors on Thursday were also digesting Nvidia's earnings and forecasts, and revised U.S. GDP data. They have an even heavier dose of top-tier data to deal with on Friday, which includes the latest inflation snapshots for Tokyo, Germany and the United States, as well as first quarter GDP readings from India, Brazil and Canada. High yields bring U.S. fiscal 'precipice' even closer Few would disagree that U.S. public finances are deteriorating, but debt Cassandras have been warning of a fiscal day of reckoning for 40 years and it has yet to arrive, so why should this time be any different? The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office's baselineforecast sees federal debt held by the public rising to 117% ofGDP over the next decade from 98% last year, and net interestpayments rising to 4% of GDP, a sixth of all federal spending. While these eye-watering figures are concerning, it stillseems difficult to fathom the United States experiencing agenuine debt crisis where investors turn their backs onTreasuries and the dollar, the two cornerstones of the globalfinancial system. Both should enjoy strong demand \u2013 at least for theforeseeable future \u2013 even if their prices may need to fall toattract buyers. And in times of extreme crisis, like 2008 and2020, the Fed can always buy huge quantities of U.S. bonds tostabilize the market. But that doesn't mean investors should ignore the swellingtide of fiscal gloom. We may not see a full-blown debt crisis,but there's a sense that \"the fiscal\" matters for markets morenow than it has for decades. ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS To better understand the risk at hand, it's useful toexplore the assumptions baked into the current U.S. debt anddeficit projections. The CBO's comprehensive fiscal projections are a benchmarkfor many policymakers and investors. But amid the fog ofuncertainty created by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war,the baseline economic assumptions underlying this outlook may betoo optimistic. The CBO assumes that the United States will experiencecontinuous, uninterrupted economic growth over the next decade.While it's true that since 1990 the U.S. economy has twice goneon streaks of more than a decade without experiencing arecession, conditions today - not the least of which is thecountry's bloated public debt burden - suggest that a repeat ishighly unlikely. And in the event of a downturn, U.S. public finances wouldalmost certainly suffer the double whammy of shrinking taxreceipts and a surge in benefit payments, pushing the countrycloser to a fiscal cliff. Of course, an economic downturn would probably also promptthe Fed to lower interest rates, which would likely cause bondyields to fall and offer some relief on debt-servicing costs. But investor angst over the debt may keep market-basedborrowing costs higher than they would otherwise be, somethingthat is also not baked into the CBO's central projections. And if government borrowing costs over the next decade arehigher than currently projected, the U.S. fiscal picture is evenmore troublesome than thought. YIELD CURVE ASSUMPTIONS Yield curve assumptions play a major \u2013 and oftenunderappreciated \u2013 role in U.S. debt sustainability projections. The current CBO projections are based on the expectationthat the yield curve will \"normalize\" in the coming year. Theyassume that the three-month Treasury yield will fall to 3.2% andthe 10-year yield will settle at 3.9%. But what if the yieldcurve stays near current levels over the next decade, with athree-month rate of 4.40% and a 10-year yield of 4.50%? Chris Marsh at Exante Data crunches the numbers and findsthat, in this scenario, federal debt held by the public couldrise to 125% of GDP by 2034 and interest payments as a share ofrevenue would approach 30%. Interest payments as a share of revenues are already aboutto exceed their late-1980s peak and may end up at the highestlevel since at least the 1950s. Adding to this concern, Saul Eslake and John Llewellyn atIndependent Economics note that if the yield curve does notnormalize, the United States could get in the dangerous positionwhere nominal GDP growth remains persistently below the 10-yearTreasury yield, meaning debt dynamics would deteriorate becauseinterest payments would outstrip growth. Given that the Trump administration's current budget bill isexpected to add nearly $4 trillion to the federal debt over thenext decade, the risk of this is especially pertinent today. One consequence of higher-for-longer U.S. interest ratesthen could be a much-heavier-for-much-longer debt burden.

This finish comes after a US trade court's ruling to pause President Trump's tariffs were temporarily reversed by an appeals court. Yahoo Finance markets and data editorJared Blikrecomes on Asking for a Trend to break down several of the day's top trading themes, including the market reactions to Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings results, waning volatility, and the defense industry. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. U.S. stocks move higher as markets assess Nvidia's earnings report as well as more tariff uncertainty. And Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joins us now with the trading day takeaways. Jared. Thank you, Josh. That is my first point after those Nvidia earnings, tariffs, tariffs kind of rule. Uh, but not in a big way. In fact, we saw the major markets. They kind of gapped up on the news. This was before the, the latest tariff news, and then they drifted down, but still the major average is closed in the green. And this is our semiconductors board, and I didn't mean to do that. Uh, let's check out Nvidia here closing the day up 3.25%, and that is the highest since February. Uh, not too far off those record highs, and it's just a quick stroke to get back to those. Got a few sticking points perhaps, but the earnings catalyst in the rearview mirror. And let's just check out the NASDAQ here because, uh, my eye has been on that. It's been kind of consolidating. This is a year to date. So we've seen breakouts in Nvidia. We've seen breakouts in a lot of stocks over the last few days, but not the major indices and they all kind of look just like that. So maybe we need another catalyst, but even tariffs not dragging it down today. But as you said, we finished in the green today. Yes. Not a disaster, right? No. But, and so my point is volatility is going down. It is waning here. Let's just check out the VIX real quickly. Uh, I got a lot of volatility charts, but we're only going to hit a couple here. Here's the VIX. It was down a whopping 30.13 points today. This is a year to date, so we're well off those highs and we've kind of settled back down below the 20 level. That's important. But what I want to show you is realized volatility. That is what is actually happening in the market rather than the VIX saying this is what we think is going to happen. Realized volatility is still pretty, pretty elevated here. So just something to consider. It is a trader's market and still a lot of things can trip you up if you're a day trader. What have been the plays recently? Uh, so that is in the defensive area. And it was really interesting today because defensive sectors were doing well. And then we also have the defense and aerospace, which is completely separate. That was doing well, uh, in addition. So let's check out the sector action real quickly. And for the leaderboard, we got real estate, energy, utilities, healthcare, all of those defensive. Oh, through say, uh, throw staples in there too. That's another defensive one. Yes, energy is defensive at times, not always, but you can put it in that basket. So there are the defense sector, their defensive sectors. And here, let's check out defense because the ITA ETF, and that covers all of this industry, has been hitting record highs. It was least affected by the tariff tantrum two months ago. And a lot of these stocks, just check out GE for instance, this has been hitting record highs day after day, after day after it surpassed them in May. Those were the old records, these are the new ones. And like I said, a lot of charts look like this. So we're seeing a lot of strength in these names. Even Boeing coming back recently, Josh. Any famous lines on defense you want to leave the audience with? Uh, there's one by Vince Lombardi. The best defense is a good offense. And so that means you need, you can't just have a portfolio filled with dogs with fleas. That's my point. Wise words. Wise words. Thank you, Jared. Appreciate it.",

The PC maker saidits guidance reflects tariff costsand actions taken to mitigate associated trade risks, adding that it had responded quickly to expand itsmanufacturingfootprint and reduce its cost structure. CEO Enrique Lores said during the earnings call that additional tariff costs \"could not be fully mitigated in the quarter,\" and that HP has \"implemented price increases to help offset cost pressure.\" HP shares fell more than 8% Thursday, posting the biggest declines in the S&P 500.

In an ominous sign, the stock broke down below the pattern\u2019s lower trendline on above-averagevolumein Wednesday\u2019s trading session ahead of the company\u2019s quarterly report, paving the way for a continuation move lower. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that therelative strength indexhas recently fallen below the 50 threshold, signaling weakening price momentum. Let\u2019s identify three importantsupport levelsto watch and also locate a key overhead area worth monitoring during future upswings. The first lower level to watch sits around $25, right about where the stock closed on Thursday. This area may provide support near a brief period ofconsolidationwithin the rising wedge pattern and the prominent September 2023 trough. A move below this level could see HP shares fall to the $23 region. The price may attract support here near the low of the stock\u2019s first minor dip afterbouncingfrom its early-April low. Selling below this level opens the door for the shares revisiting lower support at $21. Investors may seek longer-termbuy-and-holdentry points in this area near last month\u2019s tariff-driven low.

        "content": "Despite reporting mixed Q1 results Wednesday evening, Nvidia NVDAstock has popped as much as +6% in today\u2019s trading session and had retaken the top spot as the market\u2019s most valuable company ahead of Microsoft MSFT. Briefly hitting a market cap of $3.44 trillion, Nvidia\u2019s superior Blackwell series GPUs have powered its data center growth and AI factory build-outs, which are driving significant revenue for the chip giant. That said, let\u2019s see if the surge in NVDA will continue or if there are still better buying opportunities ahead. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Enduring what it called a challenging operating environment, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales of $44.06 billion topped estimates of $42.91 billion and soared 69% from $26.04 billion a year ago. Data Center revenue was the main contributor, increasing 73% year over year to $39 billion. However, Q1 EPS of $0.81 missed expectations of $0.85 despite spiking 33% from $0.61 a share in the prior period. Nvidia has surpassed sales estimates for a remarkable 25 consecutive quarters and his exceeded earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports with an average EPS surprise of 3.87%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Watering down Nvidia\u2019s bottom line was the U.S. government's export controls on its H20 data center GPU, which is designed specifically for the market in China. While Nvidia was previously able to sell its H20 AI chips to China with no restraints, the Trump administration now requires a license to do so, leading to a $4.5 billion charge due to excess inventory and purchase obligations. Nvidia hasn\u2019t publicly disclosed the exact cost of obtaining the license, but CEO Jensen Huang has criticized the export controls, stating they will weaken the U.S. chip industry and unintentionally strengthen Chinese competitors. Notably, Huang sees Huawei Technologies as a formidable AI rival and has pointed out that Tencent Holdings TCEHYand other major Chinese tech companies are shifting toward domestic alternatives to power their AI endeavors due to restrictions on U.S. chip exports.  For the second quarter, Nvidia expects Q2 sales to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. This falls within range of the current Zacks Consensus of $45.29 billion or 51% growth (Current Qtr below), and includes a projected loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion. Based on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s total sales are expected to increase 49% in its current fiscal year 2026 to $194.7 billion from $130.5 billion in FY25. Furthermore, FY27 sales are projected to rise another 24%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research For now, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Seeing as NVDA has rallied nearly +30% in the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead, especially considering export headwinds to China. Although Nvidia's data center growth is very appealing to investors, Jensen Huang has reiterated, that as one of the world\u2019s leading AI markets, China will be crucial to its global success, stating the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally.
