        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has begun construction on a third chip plant in Arizona, ramping up its US expansion as the Trump administration threatens further tariffs to spur American manufacturing. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City Transit System Chips Away at Subway Fare Evasion NYC\u2019s Congestion Toll Raised $159 Million in the First Quarter The Last Thing US Transit Agencies Should Do Now At Bryn Mawr, a Monumental Plaza Traces the Steps of Black History At the National Public Housing Museum, an Embattled Idea Finds a Home The world\u2019s most advanced chipmaker announced the third phase of its US expansion the same day Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick toured TSMC\u2019s site, which the company called the single largest foreign investment in US history. TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is the centerpiece of the US government\u2019s effort to entice manufacturing back home. Lutnick has signaled he could withhold promised Chips Act grants as he pushes companies in line for federal semiconductor subsidies to substantially expand their US projects, Bloomberg News has reported. In March, TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei joined Trump at the White House to unveil plans to invest an additional $100 billion in US plants that will boost its output on American soil. The spending adds to $65 billion in planned TSMC investments in the US and would eventually bring its American presence to a half-dozen plants for advanced wafer fabrication and a couple more for advanced packaging. Lutnick told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday the Trump administration was able to get the additional $100 billion investment without any promise of subsidies. \u201cYou know what the Trump administration paid for that? Zero. It\u2019s tariffs that brought that in. So 40,000 of construction employees, and then 20,000 full-time employees, here for the far-distant future as we bring semiconductors here. This is the point of the Trump tariff model,\u201d he said. TSMC\u2019s CEO said on an earnings call in April that the construction of the second plant in Arizona was already completed and the company was working on speeding up the production schedule. The company previously said that the first factory entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of last year with yields comparable to Taiwan factories. Wei added that the third and fourth plants will use its most advanced N2 and A16 process technologies and the fifth and sixth plants will use even more advanced technologies.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plummeted in extended trading on Tuesday after the server makerposted preliminary resultsfor its fiscal third quarter that came in well below its prior guidance. The company tied the downward revision to delayed consumer product decisions that pushed sales into the current quarter, amplifying broader concerns of a slowdown in spending amiduncertainty over the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Supermicro shares fell 15% to $30.60 in after-hours trading Tuesday. Prior to today\u2019s after-hours drop, Supermicro shares had gained 18% so far this year. The stock has, however, seen significant price swings as investors assess recent challenges relating to the company'saccountingand corporate governance practices amid a clouded demand outlook for AI infrastructure, such as servers used in data centers. Below, we take a closer look at Supermicro\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify crucial price levels worth monitoring. Supermicro shares have oscillated within anascending channelsince October last year, tagging the pattern\u2019s upper and lower trendlines on several occasion over that time. More recently, the stock has rallied from the channel\u2019s lower trendline, though the price has remained below the respected 50- and200-day moving averagesto indicate a longer-termdowntrend. With Wednesday\u2019s projected drop back toward the ascending channel's lower trendline, let\u2019s identify two crucialsupport levelsworth monitoring and also point outresistancelevels to watch during potential upswings. The first support level to monitor sits at $28. This area on the chart, just below the ascending channel\u2019s lower trendline, may attract buying interest near the April and Februaryswing lows, which also closely align with a minorcountertrendhigh during the stock\u2019s sharp sell-off in early November last year. The bulls\u2019 inability to successfully defend this important technical level opens the door for a larger decline to around $17. Bargain hunters may seekentry pointsin this area near November's prominent V-shapedswing low. Interestingly, this location also sits just below a projecteddownsidetarget that takes the stock's prior move lower within the ascending channel and repositions it from this week's high, predicting how a new trend lower may look ifprice actionrhymes. During upswings, the first level of interest to watch lies at thepsychological$50 level. Those who bought shares at lower prices may decide tolock in profitsin this region near last year\u2019s early-August trough and the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart last October. Finally, a more bullish move could see Supermicro shares revisit higher levels near $63.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.KS) reported slower profit growth and softening demand for storage chips, a sign that the US-China trade war may be triggering cuts in artificial intelligence hardware spending. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City Transit System Chips Away at Subway Fare Evasion NYC\u2019s Congestion Toll Raised $159 Million in the First Quarter The Last Thing US Transit Agencies Should Do Now At Bryn Mawr, a Monumental Plaza Traces the Steps of Black History At the National Public Housing Museum, an Embattled Idea Finds a Home Executives at the chips-to-smartphones titan warned of heightened uncertainty for the rest of the year stemming from geopolitical tensions and US tariff policies. Even before US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on almost all countries around the world, customers put some data center projects on hold, weakening demand for Samsung\u2019s solid-state drives in the March quarter, an executive from the company\u2019s memory business told analysts on Wednesday. Samsung\u2019s total capital expenditure in the quarter fell more than 30% from the previous quarter to 12 trillion won ($8.4 billion). The South Korean company\u2019s flagship products such as semiconductors, smartphones and tablets are now exempt from the so-called reciprocal tariffs, but Trump has indicated that a tariff on the electronics supply chain including chips is in the works. \u201cThere are a lot of uncertainties ahead of us,\u201d said KL Roh, an executive vice president at Samsung. Operating profit at Samsung\u2019s chip division tumbled 42% to 1.1 trillion won due to declines in average selling price. Sales of its key high-bandwidth memory chips also fell due to export controls, with some clients also deferring orders in anticipation of upcoming enhanced HBM3E products, according to Samsung. Its shares were down about 0.5% Wednesday afternoon in Seoul. In recent high-profile trade talks, Seoul and Washington agreed to pursue a comprehensive package agreement by July 8, when the 90-day tariff pause is set to end. Fears about what the final trade agreement would look like hang over Samsung\u2019s outlook, outweighing a boost from customers stockpiling PC chip supplies ahead of US tariffs and a recovery in smartphone sales. Donald Trump Jr. was in Seoul on Wednesday to meet with leaders of Korean conglomerates on the invitation of Shinsegae Group Chairman Chung Yong-jin, underscoring escalating concern in the country\u2019s business community. Korean business leaders had asked Chung to facilitate the visit to establish contact with the Trump administration, according to local reports. \u201cSamsung is planning to ramp up the enhanced 12-layer HBM3E product in the second quarter to meet demand from some clients,\u201d said Greg Noh, an analyst with Hyundai Motor Securities Co. (001500.KS) \u201cBut unless there is demand from Nvidia (NVDA), it\u2019s difficult to expect dramatic improvement in the chip business.\u201d Customers from Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Lenovo Group Ltd. (LNVGF,LNVGY) hastened shipments of consumer products to the US over the first quarter of the year to preempt tariffs. Samsung\u2019s own Galaxy S25 flagship smartphone series also buoyed earnings. That helped boost net income to 8.03 trillion won, above estimates. But such one-time pre-tariff gains have done little to assuage concern about long-term demand. Analysts including Canalys see the first-quarter surge in shipments as an acceleration of deliveries from later in the year \u2014 and any intensification in US-China tensions could put more pressure on global trade. Samsung has struggled for months to secure Nvidia Corp.\u2019s final nod for its most advanced HBM products, which are today the most lucrative segment for memory makers. Icheon-based SK Hynix Inc. (000660.KS) retains the top position in providing these chips enabling AI accelerators. That catch-up effort continues to eat away at Samsung\u2019s earnings. It spent 9 trillion won in research and development in its fiscal first quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Samsung said it has shipped its enhanced HBM3E samples to major customers and expects that product line to contribute to revenue starting in the second quarter. The company also forecast HBM sales to bottom out in the first quarter and gradually recover, helped by its improved HBM3E. For the next-generation HBM4, it maintained its target to begin mass production in the second half of the year, and said it\u2019s in talks with multiple clients for HBM4. Within Samsung\u2019s semiconductor division, the contract chipmaking business has struggled, weighed down by a lack of significant orders from major clients. This has made it harder to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which held a dominant share of almost two thirds of the global foundry market in the third quarter of 2024, according to Taipei-based TrendForce. Samsung\u2019s share stood at 9.3%. The foundry business posted a loss due to lower utilization rates and high fixed costs. However, the company expects a gradual recovery in demand, which should improve utilization and help narrow losses in the second half. Samsung\u2019s foundry arm now aims to begin mass production using 2-nanometer processes in the June quarter, a key step in its bid to catch up to TSMC and capture some of the high-end logic chipmaking business. \u2014With assistance from Vlad Savov.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the30 Stocks That Should Double in 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that should double in 3 years. On April 25, Kari Firestone, Aureus Asset Management executive chairman and co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 to discuss the latest market trends and express how this is a reasonable place for long-term investors to enter the market. Despite persistent concerns about a recession coming from tariffs, Firestone thinks that corporate earnings have generally exceeded expectations. The strong performance of major tech companies has been a key driver behind the market\u2019s recent gains, such as those in the MAG7. Elaborating on the significance of these tech giants, Firestone also underscored that the top 2 companies in the S&P 500, regardless of which they are, match the market value of the bottom 300 companies in the index. This concentration means that these leading firms are fundamental to the US economy\u2019s progress. The conversation then addressed the impact of proposed FDA budget cuts on innovation for biotech companies. Firestone agreed that such cuts could slow down the approval process for new products and drug manufacturing, and she advised against reducing the FDA\u2019s budget. However, she believes that the market has already priced in these risks. She compared the situation to previous market overreactions, such as the 32% drop during the early COVID-19 period, which was followed by a rapid recovery. Firestone also concluded that the market is now fairly valued. Some sectors offer attractive opportunities due to recent price declines. She assessed the overall market valuation in light of tariff uncertainties and the recent rebound from a 20% drop to a current decline of about 10.5%. She explained that the market\u2019s price-to-earnings multiple has decreased from 22.5x next year\u2019s earnings to 18.5x, assuming no severe recession. She\u2019s confident that the market is unlikely to end the year lower than current levels and recommends that long-term investors enter the market at this stage. Firestone believes that the market has partially priced in the impact of tariffs. She estimated that a 5% to 10% tariff is reflected in current prices. While a full-blown recession may not be entirely priced in, a slowdown likely is. We sifted through financial media reports and Reddit threads to compile a list of the top 30 stocks that should double in 3 years. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a tech company that is known for its edge in GPUs and AI platforms. Its primary revenue stems from data center GPUs like the H100 and Blackwell chips, which are essential components for AI workloads. The company is positioned to target huge markets like a $1 trillion-plus AI market, a $500 billion enterprise AI sector, and a $50 trillion robotics market. Mizuho analysts are optimistic about NVIDIA\u2019s near-term prospects, particularly with the shipment of the GB200 series and increased testing capacity for more complex GPU racks. The analysts also highlighted NVIDIA\u2019s long-term capital expenditure in AI for the calendar year 2026 as an important point for investors. On April 16, Mizuho Securities maintained its Outperform rating on the stock with a $168 price target, despite new US export restrictions that affect shipments of its H20 series products to China and other embargoed countries. These restrictions may impact around $5.5 billion in revenue from an estimated $16 billion in H20 orders. Guinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024investor letter: \u201cFor a second year running,NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund\u2019s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia\u2019s \u2018Hopper\u2019 GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current \u2018Hopper\u2019 GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia\u2019s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to \u201cinference\u201d (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia\u2019s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia\u2019s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia\u2019s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.\u201d Overall, NVDAranks 3rdon our list of the stocks that should double in 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "header": "Should Investors Worry About Nvidia's Future in China?",
        "content": "Just a few years ago,Nvidia(NVDA0.12%)generated more of its revenue in China than it did in the United States. But as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom took off, the U.S. started to become a bigger and bigger source of growth for the chip designer. U.S. tech giants fromAmazontoMeta Platformsramped up their AI platforms and turned to Nvidia for its top graphics processing units (GPUs) and other products and services. As a result, Nvidia's total revenue soared, climbing in the double and triple digits quarter after quarter to reach record levels. And China was becoming a smaller and smaller part of that picture. A geographic breakdown shows Nvidia's China revenue shrank to just 16% of total sales in the fiscal 2024 year from 26% just two years earlier. And U.S. revenue soared to 44% of total sales from 16% in that time period. But this trend wasn't uniquely due to an increase in U.S. spending on AI infrastructure. This also was a result of the U.S. government's decision back in 2022 to limit exports of powerful AI tools to China. And pressure onNvidia's prospects in Chinahas intensified in recent times. This month, the U.S. informed Nvidia that it could no longer export the chip it specially designed for China to that country. To make matters worse, big Chinese rival Huawei may be preparing a new chip to challenge Nvidia there. Should investors worry about Nvidia's future in China? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. First, it's important to remember that though government limitations on exports clearly have affected Nvidia's growth in China over the past few years, business in the U.S. and even in other countries has taken off. So Nvidia has generated significant growth -- even without a strong boost from the Chinese market. As mentioned, this is as the AI boom picked up momentum and major U.S. technology companies lined up to order Nvidia's top-performing GPUs, or AI chips used for tasks like thetraining and inferencingof large language models. Though Nvidia doesn't disclose who its biggest customers are, analyst reports and comments on AI investment from tech companies have helped many investors reach the following conclusion:Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and a few other big tech players likely are amongNvidia's biggest customers. All of this shows that spending out of the U.S. has been a significant driver of Nvidia's recent growth. Now, let's consider the challenges Nvidia faces in China. As mentioned, the U.S. recently told Nvidia that it would need a special license to sell chips -- even its specially designed one that met export guidelines -- to China. The U.S. to date hasn't offered any company such licenses. Meanwhile, rival Huawei might be using this moment to take market share in its home country. The Chinese chip company is set to test a new AI chip -- a model that could rival one of Nvidia's most powerful chips, the H100 -- next month, according to aWall Street Journalreport. If this is successful, it may be very difficult for Nvidia to return to the Chinese market -- the U.S. won't allow the company to export high-performance chips there, and local customers may not want a lower-power one if they can get top performance from Huawei. Meanwhile, Nvidia may not be done with China. TheDigiTimesreported that Nvidia may be considering the development of a separate business in China, according toWccftech. Whether this is true or not, it's clear Nvidia's resourceful chief Jensen Huang could be thinking of various options that would allow Nvidia to maintain at least some business in the country. That said, investors probably shouldn't expect China to represent a big growth market for Nvidia any time soon. So, should investors worry about this situation? Of course, this virtual roadblock in front of the Chinese border isn't good news for Nvidia. But it doesn't represent the end of Nvidia's supercharged growth story either. As we've seen in recent years, the company has benefited from growth in the U.S., and its move to produce more and more chips at home could support this. Nvidia said recently it would produce as much as $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the coming four years. It's important to remember that the AI infrastructure buildout is far from over, and technology companies -- such asAlphabetjust last week-- have spoken about their aggressive spending plans and have mentioned Nvidia as a key partner. All of this means that, yes, Nvidia could be set to face a tough moment in China. And in the worst scenario, Huawei may even jump ahead of Nvidia in China if Nvidia can't find a way to sell its chips there. But, even in that situation, the company's business elsewhere remains strong enough to drive enormous growth over time -- and make Nvidia a fantastic bet for investors on the long-term AI story.",

        "header": "Should You Buy SoundHound AI Stock Before May 8? This Recent Move by Nvidia Might Hold the Answer",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.12%)has added an eye-popping $2.3 trillion to its market capitalization since the beginning of 2023, thanks to soaring demand for its data center chips that are the best in the industry for powering and training artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia has put some of its incredible wealth to work by investing in a small portfolio of other AI stocks.SoundHound AI(SOUN-2.82%)was one of them, but the chip giant sold its entire stake during 2024's fourth quarter, according to its latest quarterly 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. SoundHound is a conversational AI specialist, and it's experiencing strong demand for its software from some of the largest brands in the world. But its stock lost its momentum after investors learned of Nvidia's exit, and it's currently down 60% from its record high. SoundHound is scheduled to report its financial results for the first quarter on May 8. Could its dip represent a buying opportunity for investors ahead of the report? Chatbots likeOpenAI'sChatGPT were originally designed to interpret text-based prompts, whereas SoundHound has always focused on conversationalAI, which parses voice-based prompts and responds in kind. Conversational AI is more practical for a range of uses in everyday life, which is why SoundHound AI's client list includes some of the world's biggest restaurant chains and car manufacturers. Its technology is active in more than 10,000 quick-service restaurant locations from operators likeChipotle,Krispy Kreme, White Castle, and more. They use it to automate food ordering in-store, over the phone, and in the drive-thru lane, which reduces the number of employees those businesses require. Plus, SoundHound also offers a tool called Employee Assist that can give workers detailed instructions for making menu items or maintaining critical equipment. Leading automotive manufacturers likeKia,Hyundai, andStellantis(owner of the Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge marques) are also using SoundHound's Chat AI in-car assistant. It can do various tasks from locating the nearest restaurant to explaining what a particular warning light means on the vehicle's dashboard -- and it's controlled entirely with voice prompts. Manufacturers can customize Chat AI with different voices and personalities to suit their brands. SoundHound is now marrying its restaurant segment with its automotive segment with its new in-vehicle commerce platform. The software enables drivers to place food orders while they are on the move without picking up a phone. It plugs into the car's GPS navigation system to locate the most suitable vendors, so the driver can ask their in-car assistant to order them a meal from the nearest Chinese restaurant (for example). In August, the company acquired AI developer Amelia, which is helping it break into new industries like healthcare, financial services, and insurance. In fact, SoundHound's largest customer accounted for just 14% of its total revenue in 2024, which was down from more than half in 2023. Having a more diversified revenue base can drive steadier growth and reduce risk in the long run. Image source: Getty Images. SoundHound AI generated $84.7 million inrevenueduring 2024, which was an 85% increase from the previous year. Management believes its growth could accelerate to a whopping 97% in 2025, as it's forecasting revenue of $167 million (at the midpoint of its guidance range). The company's first-quarter result could dictate whether or not management increases that guidance, so this is something investors should pay attention to on May 8. The second metric to watch is SoundHound's order backlog. It stood at $1.2 billion at the end of 2024, which was an eye-popping 75% year-over-year increase. The company expects to convert that figure into actual revenue over the next six years, so it could be a great predictor of future results. If its backlog continues to grow at a rapid pace, it's reasonable to expect SoundHound's revenue growth to maintain its strong momentum. However, SoundHound's rapid top-line expansion is coming at a steep cost. The company lost $350.7 million during 2024 on aGAAP(generally accepted accounting principles) basis, which was 295% more than its loss in 2023. Even after excluding one-off outlays and non-cash expenses likestock-based compensation, SoundHound still took a $69.1 millionnon-GAAPloss for the year. With just $198 million in cash and equivalents on itsbalance sheetas of the end of 2024, SoundHound can't afford to keep losing money at that pace for long. The company might have to sacrifice some revenue growth to staunch the bottom-line bleeding. Otherwise, shareholders are likely to face significant dilution through further secondary stock offerings. Despite its 60% decline from its all-time high, the stock is still expensive. It trades at aprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof 38.1, which is nearly twice the P/S ratio of Nvidia. That doesn't make much sense, consideringNvidia is arguably the highest-quality AI companyin the world.  SOUN PS Ratiodata byYCharts. SoundHound AI stock looks a little cheaper valued based on its expected future revenue. For example, assuming the company will generate $167 million in revenue this year as management expects, its forward P/S ratio would be 22.7 -- but that's still a premium valuation, especially considering the risks associated with its steep losses. Nvidia never disclosed why it sold its stake in SoundHound, so it's impossible to know whether valuation played a role. Nvidia only held 1.73 million shares, which would be worth around $16.5 million at the current price, so even a complete loss wouldn't have affected the $2.7 trillion chip giant's finances meaningfully. However, Nvidia's absence on the share register certainly took some of the shine off the bull case for SoundHound stock. Plus, given its valuation, SoundHound doesn't look like a great buy at the current price, even if you think the upcoming financial report will be a total blockbuster. Therefore, it might be better to wait for a further pullback before investing in this story.",

        "header": "Billionaires Sell Nvidia Stock Before the Market Crash and Buy a Golden ETF Up 166% in 10 Years",
        "content": "The hedge fund billionaires listed below sold shares ofNvidia(NVDA0.12%)during the fourth quarter, ahead of therecent stock market crash. They also purchasedSPDR Gold Shares(GLD-0.97%), an exchange-traded fund that soared 166% in the last decade. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and the SPDR Gold Shares ETF. Nvidia specializes in accelerated computing, a discipline that uses specialized hardware and software to speed up complexdata centerworkloads like scientific computing andartificial intelligence(AI). It is best known for itsgraphics processing units(GPUs), also known as AI accelerators, where it holds 84% market share. But the company also provides adjacent hardware and software. Nvidia has recently struggled against two headwinds. First, Chinese start-up DeepSeek trained sophisticatedlarge language modelswith less computing power than U.S. rivals. The market assumed Nvidia GPU sales would falter as AI infrastructure spending slowed. But that has not happened. Instead, Nvidia expects demand to rise as cost efficiencies let more businesses adopt AI, and reasoning models create a need for even more computing power. Second, the Trump administration recently hit Nvidia withexport restrictions on its H20 GPUs in China, which could cost the company as much as $18 billion in revenue this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. But Nvidia still dominates the AI accelerator market, which is forecast to increase at 29% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Those headwinds may explain why hedge fund managers Israel Englander and Paul Tudor Jones sold shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter. However, readers should bear in mind neither billionaire completely exited their position, so they still have exposure to the chipmaker in their portfolios. Importantly, despite headwinds related to competition and export restrictions, Wall Street estimates Nvidia's earnings will increase 46% in fiscal 2026, which ends in January. That makes the current valuation of 36 times earnings look rather cheap. Investors with a time horizon of at least three years can buy a position in this stock now. SPDR Gold Shares tracks the price of gold bullion. The fund is managed byState Streetand owns about 946 metric tons of gold, which is worth more than $100 billion at the current spot price. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF lets investors participate in the gold market without the hassle of buying, storing, and insuring physical bullion. \"Gold has demonstrated a low and negative correlation to many financial asset indices over time and has a track record of providing a hedge during periods of large market drawdowns, systemic risk, and geopolitical volatility,\" according to State Street. Indeed, gold tends to outperform theS&P 500(a benchmark for the U.S. stock market) duringbear markets, but it tends to underperform duringbull markets. The precious metal has crushed the U.S. stock market in 2025. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF has advanced 28% year to date, while the S&P 500 has declined 6%. Economic uncertainty is the reason for that discrepancy. Many economists have raised their recession probability forecasts as the Trump administration has sown chaos with its trade policies. So, investors have moved away from risk assets like stocks and toward safe-haven assets like gold. If President Trump's tariffs push the S&P 500 into a bear market, gold will likely continue to outperform. But if the administration reaches trade deals with a sufficient number of foreign countries, the current bull market could regain momentum, in which case gold would likely underperform. That makes the SPDR Gold Shares ETF a smart buy for any investor concerned about a more substantial drawdown in the S&P 500.",

        "header": "Better Semiconductor Stock: AMD vs. Nvidia",
        "content": "ThePHLX Semiconductor Sectorindex has been under duress this year and lost over 14% of its value thanks to the tariff-fueled economic uncertainty that has raised the potential of a global recession, which explains why some of the major names in this sector have performed poorly on the stock market in 2025. Shares of bothAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.47%)andNvidia(NVDA0.12%)are down close to 20% so far this year. However, the recent tariff-related developments suggest that thesesemiconductor stockscould see a solid comeback, especially considering their impressive results in recent quarters. From pausing reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to exempting duties on imports of semiconductors and other equipment from China to starting trade talks, there are signs of the trade war easing. China has reportedly rolled back retaliatory tariffs on certain semiconductor components made in the U.S. So, there is a good chance that the cloud of uncertainty hovering over companies such as Nvidia and AMD that have been caught in the trade war could clear and help these semiconductor stocks regain their mojo. But if you have to buy one of these two chip stocks for your portfolio, which one should it be? Let's find out. AMD manufactures chips that go into applications such as data centers, personal computers (PCs), and gaming consoles, among others. The demand for AMD's chips that go into data centers and PCs has been picking up in recent quarters thanks toartificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, AMD's revenue from data center chip sales shot up 69% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $3.9 billion. The company credited this impressive growth to a ramp-up in sales of its data center graphics cards and server processors. While Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI GPU market, AMD has been gradually gaining ground over here. On its Februaryearnings conference call, CEO Lisa Su remarked that the deployment of its MI300X AI accelerators \"expanded with our largest cloud partners.\" The likes ofMeta Platforms,Microsoft,IBM, andDigitalOceanare powering their AI models with AMD's chips, which is why the company has decided to accelerate the launch of its upcoming MI350 AI chips based on the CDNA 4 architecture. AMD points out that the CDNA 4 architecture delivers a 35x jump in AI compute performance as compared to the previous generation CDNA 3. The company has received positive customer feedback and believes that the MI350 family of AI chips could drive \"deeper and broader customer engagements with both existing and net new hyperscale customers.\" AMD will begin shipments of the MI350 chips in the middle of 2025. So, there is a good chance that its data center revenue will continue to grow at a healthy pace thanks to AI. However, this is not the only AI-focused opportunity that the company is sitting on. The adoption of AI PCs is giving AMD's client processor business a nice boost. Its revenue from this segment rose 58% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024, thanks to the strong demand for its Ryzen processors. AMD reported record sell-through of its desktop processors in the fourth quarter of 2024 and exceeded 70% share at several major retailers. The company is also pushing the envelope in the laptop space with the launch of 22 new mobile processors equipped with AI capabilities. AMD believes that its solid portfolio of laptop and desktop CPUs should help it grab a bigger share of the PC market in 2025. It is worth noting that AMD's overall CPU market share increased in the fourth quarter of 2024 to almost 25%, according to Mercury Research, and the points discussed above suggest that it can make a bigger dent in this market. So, the robust demand for chips used in servers and computers should remain a tailwind for AMD in 2025 and beyond, driving healthy growth in the company's top and bottom lines. Nvidia's dominant position in the market for AI chips helped the company deliver impressive growth in recent quarters. Nvidia ended fiscal 2025 with $130.5 billion in revenue, up by 114% from the previous year. Its revenue guidance of $43 billion for the current quarter points toward a potential jump of 65% in its top line, suggesting that its healthy pace of growth is here to stay. That's not surprising, as Nvidia reportedly controls a whopping 90% of the data center GPU market. This is also the reason why its data center revenue growth of 93% in the last reported quarter was higher than AMD's, even though Nvidia has a much larger revenue base. Looking ahead,Nvidia's technological advantageover AMD could help it remain the leading player in AI chips, and that puts the company in a terrific position to keep growing at a solid pace. After all, the market for AI chips is expected to jump by 2.5x by 2029, generating an annual revenue of $311 billion. Nvidia's data center revenue of $115 billion in the previous quarter indicates that it still has a lot of room for growth in this space, and it may be able to corner a significant chunk of the end-market opportunity thanks to its massive share of this space. Nvidia also has additional catalysts coming into play, such as the automotive market, where it is expecting its revenue to nearly triple this year following a 55% increase in the previous fiscal year. So, it is easy to see why analysts are forecasting Nvidia's earnings to increase by 48% in the current fiscal year, though don't be surprised to see the company doing better than that, as its margin profile should start improving once the production of itsBlackwell AI processors ramps up. So, just like AMD, even Nvidia is thriving on solid semiconductor demand. But is it a better buy than its peer? Let's find out. We have seen that Nvidia is on track to clock healthy earnings growth this year. A similar scenario is expected to unfold at AMD, with an estimated earnings jump of 33% in 2025. Importantly, AMD's bottom-line growth is expected to grow to 36% in 2026. However, Nvidia expects a slowdown as its bottom line is projected to grow 28% in the next fiscal year. AMD's stronger growth forecast next year can be attributed to the company's diversified business, while the potential slowdown in Nvidia's earnings growth could be a result of intensifying competition in AI chips. What's more, AMD's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.44 indicates that it is undervalued after accounting for its annual projected earnings growth for the next five years, according to Yahoo! Finance. Nvidia seems overvalued right now, with a PEG ratio of 1.57, which can be attributed to a potential drop in its pace of earnings growth. So, AMD seems like the better semiconductor growth stock to buy right now, considering the points discussed above, though investors cannot go wrong by choosing Nvidia either, as the latter's massive addressable opportunity couldensure years of solid growthand stock upside.",

        "header": "Nasdaq Bear Market? 3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Down 15% This Year.",
        "content": "On Monday, theNasdaqCompositeopened at 17,390.90. That's down nearly 14% from the high it reached last year at around 20,174, which means it's out of bear market territory for the time being. But it may not be out of it for good. With investors still concerned about tariffs and the state of the overall economy, it may not take much for the bears to come out in full force again. In the meantime, you may want to consider buying some promising artificial intelligence (AI) stocks amid this downturn. Three stocks that stand to benefit from AI's growth and that are down more than 15% at this writing includeNvidia(NVDA0.12%),Arista Networks(ANET3.29%), andBroadcom(AVGO-0.71%). The shares of chipmaking giant Nvidia have fallen close to 20% since the start of the year. There are concerns that spending on AI may not be as significant as expected given the emergence ofDeepSeekand other cheaper AI models. And a trade war involving the U.S. and China could weigh on Nvidia's sales to that part of the world. A recent report also suggests that Chinese-based Huawei is looking to create AI chips to rival Nvidia's. All in all, it paints a troubling outlook for the business. But competition is nothing new for Nvidia; companies have tried to take market share away in the past. Yet it remains the dominant player in the AI chip market. There are valid concerns about slowing growth, but its reduced valuation could still make it an enticing buy. Nvidia's stock is trading at 38 times its trailing earnings, down from more than 80, which is what investors were paying for the business in the early part of last year. At a lower multiple, expectations won't be as high. And investors are probably expecting more of a slowdown simply because attaining a high growth rate (e.g., more than 50%) likely isn't going to be sustainable anyway. Some conservatism and perhaps even negativity looks to be priced into Nvidia's valuation right now, which is why this may be the optimal time to buy theAI stock, particularly if you're willing to hang on for the long haul. The stock down the most on this list is Arista Networks. It has fallen by close to 30% since the start of the year. The company plays a crucial role in the AI market as it equips businesses with the necessary networking solutions and infrastructure they need to be AI ready and to grow their capabilities. The company has achieved monstrous growth in recent years, with sales rising from $2.9 billion in 2021 to more than $7 billion this past year. It still has room for much more growth, but if the market has soured on Nvidia and AI as a whole, then it's unsurprising that Arista's stock also plummeted in value. At 35 times its trailing earnings, the stock is a little cheaper than Nvidia's, and it could make for an appealing option for investors who want a more modestly valued AI business; Arista's market cap currently hovers around $100 billion. While that's high, it's nowhere near Nvidia's multitrillion-dollar valuation. One company thatrecently hit the $1 trillion markis Broadcom, but it has come down from those levels and declined 18% this year. The semiconductor company benefited from large companies -- often referred to as hyperscalers -- ramping up their AI capabilities. The danger, however, is that if that feverish AI spending slows due to a recession, that will inevitably hurt demand for Broadcom's custom-built AI chips. Broadcom is the most expensive AI stock on this list, trading at close to 90 times its trailing earnings. But when factoring in its expected growth, that multiple falls to 29 based on next year's expected earnings. Unfortunately, with a lot of uncertainty ahead, investors may not find much comfort and safety in those estimates anymore. It could be a challenge for Broadcom in the short run, but with a lot of top companies relying on its chips, includingMicrosoftandOracle, it's still in a great position to benefit from opportunities in AI over the long haul.",

        "header": "Prediction: 1 Stock That'll Be Worth More Than Apple a Year From Now",
        "content": "Apple(AAPL0.60%)is the largest company in the world with a market cap of $3.1 trillion, reaching this position thanks to robust demand for its consumer electronics products such as the iPhone, MacBooks, and iPads, among others. However, the past few years haven't been all that great for Apple, as its largest product by revenue -- the iPhone -- has stagnated in terms of sales. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, for instance, Apple's iPhone revenue was flat year over year. Given that this product accounts for 55% of Apple's top line, it is easy to see why the company's revenue increased by only 4% during the quarter. The company has been relying on its high-margin services business to drive stronger earnings growth, but the influence of the iPhone on Apple's business indicates why its earnings increased just 10% from the year-ago period. Throw in the uncertainties created by the tariff-fueled trade war that could negatively impact sales of smartphones, and it is easy to see why analysts are expecting the company's earnings to grow by just 7% this year. However, there's another company expected to deliver much stronger growth, and it may even overtake Apple'smarket capin the next year. Let's take a closer look at that name and check why it may make sense to buy it over Apple right now. The robust demand forNvidia's(NVDA0.12%)graphics processing units (GPUs) for deployment in AI data centers has made it the third-largest company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. So, Nvidia isn't far behind Apple in terms of valuation, and the one-year median price targets of both companies indicate that the chipmaker is likely to get bigger than the consumer electronics giant. Nvidia's 12-month median price target of $160 points toward potential gains of 47% in the next year. That's higher than the 17% gain Apple stock is expected to deliver in the next year, as per its median price target of $245. So, analysts are expecting Nvidia to become a bigger company than Apple in the next 12 months, and that's not surprising, as the former's earnings are expected to grow at a much faster pace of 48% in the current fiscal year. The reason why Nvidia could indeed deliver such terrific growth is the outstanding demand for its latest generation of Blackwell AI GPUs. The company sold $11 billion worth of Blackwell processors in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, accounting for nearly a third of its total data center revenue. What's worth noting is that Nvidia's data center revenue nearly doubled year over year in the previous quarter to $35.6 billion, and Blackwell's contribution clearly indicates that it is now moving the needle in a bigger way for the company. Looking ahead, the demand for Nvidia's data center GPUs is likely to remain robust, thanks to massive investments such as the $500 billion Stargate Project led by OpenAI and SoftBank. The Stargate team expects to deploy a massive $100 billion this year to build AI infrastructure in the U.S., followed by another $400 billion over the next four years. The first data center site under the Stargate Project is expected to use 400,000 Nvidia chips. The entry-level Blackwell B100 GPU reportedly has an average selling price of $30,000 to $35,000, while the top-end GB200 chip goes for $60,000 to $70,000. Assuming Nvidia sells those 400,000 chips for even $35,000 apiece, it could generate $14 billion in revenue at least from the first Stargate site. Given that a total of 10 Stargate sites are expected to be built in the U.S., Nvidia has a massive opportunity to sustain the impressive growth it's been delivering in recent years. Moreover, the heavy investments in AI infrastructure by big tech companies this year are going to be another tailwind for the chip giant. Additionally, the company is gaining momentum in areas such as automotive, where its revenue isexpected to jump significantly this year, and a $300 billion addressable opportunity suggests that there is terrific room for growth in this market. We have seen why Nvidia is likely to overtake Apple's market cap in the next year, but what makes the chipmaker worth buying is its attractive valuation. Investors can buy Nvidia at 24.8 timesforward earningsright now, which is cheaper than Apple's forward earnings multiple of 28.7. So, a combination of faster growth, cheaper valuation, and the healthy state of the AI chip market as compared to the potential decline in the smartphone market are the reasons why Nvidia could become a bigger company than Apple in the next year.",

The company, the world's largest chip packaging and testing provider, is still evaluating an invitation from a customer to invest in the U.S. and has yet to decide on the investment size or timing, its Chief Financial Officer Joseph Tung told an earnings call. He did not name the customer but the company later confirmed to Reuters that he was talking about a plan announced by AI chip giant Nvidia made public earlier this month to expand production in the U.S., with the help of partners including ASE subsidiary Siliconware Precision Industries. Analysts have questioned whether the sum of $500 billion is realistic, given difficulties suppliers may have in moving production. Nvidia declined to comment. The customer had invited ASE to \"evaluate the possibility of having some operations to support their business in the U.S,\" Tung said. \"Currently we are engaging in discussion and are evaluating opportunities with interest. There are no further details so far in terms of the actual investment size or the timing of it. But any decision that we will eventually make will be made with economic viability.\" When asked by analysts about what kind of product would be considered, Tung he said it would be an extension of what the company offers in Taiwan. Siliconware Precision Industries, which carries out chip packaging for Nvidia, has no manufacturing presence in the U.S. Another ASE subsidiary, ISE Labs, has two testing factories in California.

        "content": "The market's recent downturn has tested even the most steadfast investors. With theVanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO0.64%)-- anexchange-traded fund(ETF) that tracks the performance of the benchmarkS&P 500-- down nearly 7% (at the time of this writing) in 2025 amid escalating trade tensions, many investors are questioning their core holdings. I've taken the opposite approach. Namely, I'm actively increasing my position in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF during this pullback. Far from a contrarian gamble, this decision reflects a conviction that three powerful technological transformations will make today's fears temporary footnotes in a much larger story of American innovation and growth. Read on to find out more. Image source: Getty Images. Remember whenartificial intelligence(AI) merely autocompleted your Google searches? Those days are long gone. Today's AI systems have evolved into true productivity multipliers, fundamentally transforming knowledge work across every major industry. While headlines often focus on job displacement, the bigger story is how AI is supercharging human capability. Lawyers using AI assistants report completing contract reviews in a fifth of the time. Software engineers leveraging AI coding tools are shipping features twice as fast. Healthcare providers using AI documentation platforms are seeing more patients with less administrative burnout -- all according to recent industry reports. This productivity revolution benefits S&P 500 companies in two critical ways. First, major AI technology providers --Microsoft,Nvidia, andAmazon-- comprise over 15% of the index. Second, many of the remaining 487+ companies are rapidly adopting AI to improve margins, accelerate innovation, and deliver better customer experiences. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF gives investors broad exposure to both the creators and adopters of these transformative technologies. For decades, robotics overpromised and underdelivered -- effective in tightly controlled environments but fragile in the real world. Two major shifts are changing that: advances in machine learning and persistent labor shortages across developed economies. Today's robots, powered by AI, can handle tasks that once required human judgment. Warehouse robots now recognize and pick irregular objects from jumbled bins. Agricultural robots harvest individual fruits at peak ripeness. Manufacturing robots adapt to supply variations without needing reprogramming. This evolution could not have arrived at a better time. With more than two-million manufacturing positions poised to go unfilled in the U.S. by 2030, American companies are embracing automation not to replace workers, but because workers simply are not available. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers exposure to companies building this game-changing automation infrastructure and to manufacturers integrating it to close growing labor gaps. The third technological wave reshaping the economy is the emergence of autonomous transportation. After years of slower-than-expected progress, several forces are driving a true inflection point. Breakthroughs in foundation models have dramatically improved computer vision. Regulatory frameworks for autonomous vehicles are maturing across multiple states. Meanwhile, driver shortages in logistics, transit, and ride-sharing are creating enormous incentives to accelerate autonomy solutions. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF allows investors to participate across the entire autonomous value chain -- from chipmakers like Nvidia andQualcomm, to vehicle manufacturers likeTeslaandGeneral Motors, to logistics companies likeFedExandUPSpoised to cut transportation costs. The efficiency gains from driverless tech should significantly boost profit margins and earnings over the balance of the decade. With an industry-leading 0.03%expense ratioand a 10-year average annual return of 12.4% through 2024, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers an unparalleled combination of performance and cost efficiency. But the fund's most important strength lies not in its historical returns but in its unique ability to evolve with the economy.  VOO Total Return Leveldata byYCharts. When I invest in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, I'm not buying yesterday's economy; I'm buying a continuously updating portfolio of America's most innovative and resilient businesses. As older industries fade and newer ones emerge, the index refreshes to reflect the real drivers of growth. What's the bottom line? Today's headlines around trade tensions will eventually fade. What won't fade is the relentless march of technological progress. By steadily buying the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF through this turbulence, I'm positioning my portfolio to benefit from the forces that will shape the global economy in the next decade and beyond.",

        "header": "2 Red-Hot Growth Stocks to Buy in 2025",
        "content": "With the marketwide sell-off, plenty of red-hot growth stocks have sold off and don't have near the premium attached to them as they once did. This is excellent news for investors, as they might regain that premium when the market recovers, giving investors a nice profit. I thinkNvidia(NVDA0.12%)andMercadoLibre(MELI2.93%)are two red-hot growth stocks worth buying right now. Both have excellent growth prospects ahead of them, and I think now is the time to pounce. Nvidia has been the biggest growth story over the past two years, but 2025 hasn't been so kind. It was caught up in the marketwide sell-off, and now sits around 27% off its all-time high. Nvidia's jaw-dropping growth over the past few years came from its dominance in the data centerGPU (graphics processing unit)market. GPUs are the tool of choice in this industry as they are incredibly useful for processing workloads that require intensive calculations, such as AI model training. GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, an effect that can be further amplified by connecting additional GPUs in a cluster. Nvidia has the best products in this space and has enjoyed a dominant market share position thanks to its superiority. However, the market dramatically sold off Nvidia's stock because it believes that it won't be able to live up to the growth expectations that were previously priced in. As a result, the stock's valuation tumbled.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At25 times forward earnings,it's only marginally more expensive than the broader market, which trades at 20.5 times forward earnings. This is despite massive growth estimates for this year and next, alongside a projection that data center capital expenditures will exceed $1 trillion by 2028. Considering that the current capital expenditure amount hovers around $400 billion, and Nvidia generated $115 billion over the past 12 months from its data center GPUs, it clearly gets a large chunk of this spending. If this projection comes true, Nvidia's stock is a no-brainer buy at this price, as investors are worried about what will happen over the next few months rather than over the next five years. MercadoLibre(MELI2.93%)is often referred to as theAmazonof Latin America. But that's selling it short. To capture its strong fintech business, the comparison would also need to includePayPal. Latin America isn't as far along in the e-commerce buildout as the U.S. is, so there's still a ton of growth in this space. However, MercadoLibre established market dominance and will capture the lion's share of growth in this important industry. MercadoLibre also showed steady growth quarter after quarter.  MELI Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)data byYCharts Those growth rates may drop a bit in 2025 and 2026, with Wall Street analysts projecting 24% and 23% revenue growth in those years. Still, those are strong growth rates, and MercadoLibre has an excellent track record of beating analyst projections. MercadoLibre is a great way to invest outside U.S. borders and isn't a stock caught up in U.S. tariff fears. Although the stock is near its all-time high right now, it makes for an excellent buy, and investors can be confident the stockwill be worth far more a few years down the road.",

Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are mixed after theS&P 500andDow Jones Industrial Averageextended theirwinning streaks to six sessionsamid a wave of corporate earnings. Dow futures are pointing slightly higher after the blue-chip index advanced by 0.8% in the prior session, while S&P 500 futures are down 0.3%.Nasdaqfutures are 0.6% lower after the tech-heavy index added 0.6% Tuesday.\u00a0Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is little changed at around $95,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are down at 4.15%. Oil and gold future are lower. Magnificent Sevenstalwarts Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) are set to report quarterly earnings after markets close today. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expectMicrosoft to have increased fiscal third-quarter revenueby 10% year-over-year to $68.44 billion and deliver earnings per share of $3.21, up from $2.94. Meta is seen reporting\u00a0first-quarter EPS of $5.24 on revenue of $41.35 billion, which would represent 11% and 13% growth, respectively. Microsoft shares are little changed in premarket trading, while those of Meta are slipping 1%. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares areplunging 17% in premarket tradingafter the server maker published preliminary results that came in lower than its prior forecast. Supermicro said it nowexpects current-quarter revenueof $4.5 billion to\u00a0$4.6 billion, well below its previous estimate of $5 billion to $6 billion, while its projected adjusted EPS of 29 cents to 31 cents was down from the prior 46 cents to 62 cents. The downward revisions come after delayed consumer product decisions pushed sales into Supermicro's fiscal fourth quarter, the company said. Starbucks (SBUX) stock is dropping more than 8% in premarket trading after the coffee seller reported quarterlyrevenue and earnings that missed analysts' expectationsas global same-store sales slipped 1%.Starbucks reported a 2% revenue bump to\u00a0$8.76 billion and adjusted EPS of 41 cents, both short of Visible Alpha estimates. The report comes as CEO Brian Niccol pushes a\"Back to Starbucks\"turnaround plan that has includedrevamping the chain's cafesin a bid to make them more welcoming. Shares of Caterpillar (CAT) are rising 3.5% in premarket trading on Wednesday even though the construction equipment maker\u00a0reported a bigger-than expected first-quarter sales decline. Caterpillar posted revenue that fell 10% to $14.25 billion, while analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $14.65 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.25 matched projections. Caterpillar also presented two outlook scenarios for the full year, one that showed revenue would be \"about flat\" without the impact of tariffs, better than previous forecast of \"down slightly,\" and another with tariffs that projects revenue in line with the prior expectation of a slight decline.",

Business\u00a0outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.  |Indicator|Actual|Estimate| |:-|:-|:-| |GDP|\\-0.3%|\\-0.2%| |Personal consumption|\\+1.8%|\\+1.2%| |PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\\+3.5%|\\+3.1%|  >The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a\u00a0supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.  >Forecasters currently see\u00a0nearly even\u00a0odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.  >The latest GDP figures showed\u00a0imports\u00a0surged an annualized about 41% \u2014 the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren\u2019t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.  >Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed\u00a0business inventories\u00a0contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.  >Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at\u00a0final sales\u00a0to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.  >Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.

We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Mag Man. Yes. That's your your version of your flavor of Mag 7. Um, what does that mean and why should people maybe be looking at that area right now? So Mag Man is the largest uh mega cap tech stocks minus Tesla because we think that's more of a car company. But that is one of my favorite areas in the market. Number one, I think there's a big disconnect out there when it comes to what's happening in their performance. If you look at Mag Man, they're down about 13% year to date. Their earnings revisions have actually gone higher so far this year by about 0.2%. The rest of the market's down 3%. Their earnings have been revised down 4%. So big difference there. And then when I look at valuations, believe it or not, those large cap tech stocks are the cheapest valuations versus the S&P since 2017. That's a long time. I think that's an opportunity. And when I look at what they're doing with their cash hoard, they're increasing their buybacks. That's up 27%. I think that I know you had the previous uh speaker on. I think that when you look at the spending, the CAPEX, I still think it's going to be relatively strong. Between those four hyperscalers he's talking about, you're talking about over $300 billion this year. I think that's pretty robust spending. So I think that's going to continue. And the last thing I'd say is that as opposed to where it was a year ago where everybody loved Big Cap Tech, now it's got the largest underweight in institutional portfolios since 2022.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell as much as 3.8% in premarket trade on Wednesday as news from Wall Street and Washington spurred fears of moderating AI demand and tightening chip trade rules from the Trump administration. Nvidia customer Super Micro Computer (SMCI), which makes servers using Nvidia\u2019s designs to sell to data center operators and tech firms,cut its revenue and profit outlook for the third quarter\u2014 the latestnews tosignal a wider potential pullbackin demand for AI infrastructure. Super Micro shares fell as much as 17% Wednesday before the market open. Tech stockswere also under broad pressureamid a market sell-off spurred by negative news early Wednesday on US economic growth and the state of the labor market. Another challenge for Nvidia stock, according to analysts, is further potential changes from the Trump administration to AI chip export rules.Reuters reportedlate Tuesday that Trump officials are working to change a Biden-era AI trade rule capping access to US AI chips, potentially making it stricter. Big Tech has called on Trumpto scrap the so-called AI Diffusion rule passed by Biden in January during his final days in office, which would restrict chip exports by country using a tiered system. Aside from 18 \"key\" US allies (i.e. \u201ctier one\u201d), the rulecapped the amount of AI chips that roughly 150 countries can purchase from US companieswithout obtaining a special license, with the aim of thwarting chip smuggling to China. These \"tier two\" countries include Israel, Switzerland, and India. \u201cTier three\u201d countries such as China, North Korea, and Iran are already blacklisted from the US chip trade. The AI Diffusion rule would go into effect in May. Reuters reported Trump administration officials are weighing discarding the tiered approach and instead using a global licensing regime with government-to-government agreements, making the rule possibly more restrictive. Citi analyst Atif Malik wrote in a note to investors late Tuesday, \"these modifications, if true, would be potentially more strict than Biden's as they would put AI chips at the center of tariff negotiations.\" In Malik's view this would create more uncertainty for the stock. Bernstein\u2019s Stacy Rasgon said in his own note the existing rules seemed, in his view, \"onerous and capricious... replacing a global framework with individually negotiated bilateral agreements seems clearly worse.\" Rasgon added, \"given increasing decoupling of the US from the rest of the world we see potential risk that such rules open up further opportunities for non-US options like Huawei, who (even though uncompetitive had-to-head) could be seen as more viable if they become the only option available (we are about to see this in China anyway given the recent H20 ban).\u201d Nvidia stock spiraledearlier this month after the US government effectively banned exports of its H20 chips made specifically for the Chinese market to comply with ever-tightening US trade rules. Since then, reports have surfaced that Chinese tech giant Huawei is rushing to fill the gap,introducing a new advanced AI chipreportedly more competitive than Nvidia\u2019s prior generation H100 chips. Trump has alsoset the stage to tariff semiconductors. TD Cowen analysts this week said the administration could introduce semiconductor tariffs of as high as 25% as soon as July. CEO Jensen Huang has courted global leaders amid the rapid deterioration of trade relations between the US, China, and other key trading partners. Huangmet with trade officialsin China andleaders in Japanearlier this month and aswset to visit DC Wednesday. \"It is unfortunate that AI is getting so caught up amid ill-conceived, self-inflicted geopolitical actions given we think AI demand overall remains relatively healthy, and the hardware itself has some shelter from direct tariff effects,\" Bernstein's Rasgon wrote. The Trump administration hastemporarily exempted computing products\u2014 including GPUs and servers \u2014 from reciprocal tariffs. And as Rasgon previously noted, even if those measures are scrapped, most Nvidia chips are imported in the form of AI servers from Mexico, which are exempt from US tariffs under the USMCA.

The Snapchat operator wrote in a letter to investors that because it's not clear \"how macro economic conditions may evolve in the months ahead, and how this may impact advertising demand more broadly, we do not intend to share formal financial guidance for Q2.\" The company explained that even though revenue continued to increase, \"we have experienced headwinds to start the current quarter, and we believe it is prudent to continue to balance our level of investment with realized revenue growth.\" As a result, Snap is reducing its expectation for full-year adjustedoperating expensesto $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion from its previous estimate of $2.70 billion to $2.75 billion. It also sees its 2025 stock compensation at $1.13 billion to $1.16 billion, down from the previous forecast of $1.15 billion to $1.20 billion. The warning offset better-than-anticipated first-quarter results. The company reported a net loss of $0.08 per share on revenue that rose 14% year-over-year to $1.36 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for a loss of $0.14 per share and revenue of $1.35 billion. CEO Evan Spiegel noted Snap surpassed 900 millionmonthly active users (MAU)for the first time, and that the revenue jump was driven by \"the progress we have made with our direct-response advertising solutions, continued momentum in driving performance for small and medium sized businesses, and the growth of our Snapchat+ subscription business.\" Snap shares have slumped nearly 30% so far in 2025.

The company has seen a \"moderation in trends for inbound travel into the U.S.\" so far this year, particularly from Canada, CFO Ewout Steenbergen said, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. U.S. travelers have also decreased their length of stays, and the CFO said Booking has seen \"some evidence of a bifurcated economy in the U.S.\" as demand for hotels with higher star ratings have seen demand stay more stable than their lower-star counterparts. Analysts from JPMorgan and UBS lifted their price targets to $5,360 and $5,750, respectively, following the report. The JPMorgan analysts said that Booking's operations across the globe should help the company offset any weakness in U.S. travel activity. UBS analysts also suggested Booking could be able to continue growing revenue and profits even if hotel room bookings slow, as the company pushes further into offering booking options for \"alternative accommodations, flights, ground transportation, and attractions.\" Jefferies analysts were more cautious, with a \"hold\" rating and $5,000 price target.

After falling decisively below the200-day moving average (MA)earlier this month, Starbucks shares consolidated within asymmetrical triangleto signal indecision among market participants ahead of the company\u2019s quarterly earnings. However, the stock broke down below the pattern's bottom trendline early Wednesday, setting the stage for a potentialcontinuationmove lower.

Let\u2019s identify two majorsupport levelswhere Starbucks shares could attract buying interest and also locate important overhead areas worth monitoring during potential recovery efforts. The first level to watch sits around $77. Investors may seekentry pointsin this location near the April low, which also closely aligns with a brief consolidation period that preceded a significantbreakaway gapon the chart last August. Selling below this level could see Starbucks shares revisit lower support at $72. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near last year\u2019s prominent May and Julyswing lows. The location also sits in the vicinity of a measured moveprice targetthat calculates the width of the symmetrical triangle and deducts that amount from the pattern\u2019s lower trendline. During potential recovery efforts, investors should keep a close eye on the $91 area. Tactical traders could place sell orders in this region near the opening price of last August\u2019s breakaway gap which lines up with the low of aretracementthe following month.

As a key Nvidia partner, the guidance cut from Super Micro weighed heavily on sentiment, sending its own stock plunging 15%. Adding to market unease, aReutersreport said Trump administration officials are exploring tighter restrictions on AI chip exports. The proposal would replace President Biden's three-tiered licensing structure with a more centralized global approval process. Under Biden's framework, set for May rollout, top-tier U.S. allies can purchase chips freely, while others like India and Israel need licenses. China and Iran remain barred entirely. Trump's approach could further limit overseas sales, particularly in key growth regions. Major banks including Citi and Bernstein flagged the changes as a risk to Nvidia's international expansion, warning that firms like Huawei could capitalize. Despite the drop, Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI. But new tariffs, possibly reaching 25%, and shifting geopolitics may cap upside in the near term.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. Jay Goldberg, Seaport's senior analyst, set a $100 price target on Nvidia sharesroughly 60% below current levelsciting Blackwell?series GPU supply constraints at TSMC and growing complexity in system integration. He warned that AI is probably not a bubble, but it may take many years before true utility becomes apparent, and that as customers hunt for concrete use cases and returns on massive AI investments, Nvidia's outperformance could wane. According to Seeking Alpha data, only five of 62 Wall Street analysts have given Nvidia a Sell or Strong Sell in the last 90 days, underscoring how striking Seaport's call is. Shares slid 2.5% by midday Wednesday, testing technical support near $370 after peaking above $580 in late March. Seaport's report points to growing pains in the AI hardware cycleNvidia's Blackwell line is already sold out for the year, but demand may outstrip TSMC's packaging capacity. Goldberg also flagged potential share?of?wallet shifts as enterprises diversify their compute stacks, and cautioned that incremental AI revenue growth could lag investor expectations. Seaport paired its Nvidia downgrade with sector?wide ratings: it initiated coverage of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) at Buy with a $230 target, cut Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Sell at $18, and set Sell ratings on Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) earned a Buy call at $110. These moves underscore Seaport's view that the mid?cap and legacy chipmakers face steeper headwinds if AI capex cools. Investors should care because Nvidia's steep forward P/E relies on hyper?growth assumptions that may struggle to keep pace with supply and execution challenges. A sharper correction in NVDA could ripple through AI?centric portfolios, prompting re?rating of GPU suppliers and integrators alike. With Nvidia set to report Q2 results after the close on May 22, markets will be looking for updated guidance on Blackwell shipments, gross?margin outlook and commentary on capacity constraints. The tone set in that call could either validate Seaport's bearish stance or reinforce the consensus that Nvidia remains unassailable in the AI hardware race.

        "content": "Stephen Guilfoyle,\u00a0 the President of Sarge986 LLC, recently stated that he had completely unloaded his holdings of Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) a month or two ago, after previously steadily reducing his stakes in the companies. In addition to losing a great deal of their China business, the firms have \"lost pricing power\" amid greater competition in the U.S.,\u00a0 Guilfoyle suggested. NVDA and AMD are currently \"in a tough spot,\" he said. The video was posted by TheStreet. Greater Domestic Competition The large cloud-infrastructure players are being pressured to buy AI chips from more companies and a number of them, including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), are making their own AI processors, \u00a0 Guilfoyle said. Amid these trends, there's \"pricing pressure\" on \"the designers of higher- end AI chips,\" said Guilfoyle, who previously had only mentioned two U.S.-based AI chip makers in the video: NVDA and AMD. \"I don't think they have the pricing power the way they once did,\" the investor added. Largely Cut Off\u00a0 From the Chinese Market NVDA and AMD are now not allowed to sell the previous versions of their AI chips in China, and Huawei, a China-based tech firm, is filling the void, Guilfoyle reported.

        "content": "We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Reveals Details Of Trump\u2019s Tariff Negotiations & Discusses 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. In his recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the supply chain disruption that firms were facing and planning for in the wake of President Trump\u2019s tariffs.\u00a0\u201cI think that this was the week where people said I better have an alternative supply chain, I just have to. Wherever it is, which is going to hurt the gross margins,\u201d Cramer said. Cramer also linked the current supply chain disruptions to the one that businesses faced during the coronavirus pandemic. Cramer mentioned an unnamed CEO who had prepared for the current disruption by learning lessons from COVID. According to Cramer: \u201cI\u2019m speaking to a major CEO, at a major tech company who said, do you think that we didn\u2019t learn anything from COVID? COVID was a total shutdown [in] China and we learned to move away from China. And China misjudged what we learned during COVID.\u201d The conversation then shifted to President Trump\u2019s negotiations with America\u2019s trading partners. While most media attention has focused on China, he mentioned negotiations with Japan and South Korea. Starting with Japan, Cramer outlined: \u201cI was talking to someone who has been in on the Japanese negotiations. And I asked for color. And he said, they\u2019re color-full. But that someone\u2019s playing very hardball, in our country, and I presume, that someone is, obviously our President. And I said, does he know that you are our friends, and he just didn\u2019t respond. I thought it was interesting.\u201d As for Korea, he believes that the country is the Trump administration\u2019s favorite due to its already sizable manufacturing presence in the US. Cramer shared: \u201cMy answer on Korea is, that. . . they are loved. . . Okay, so Korea builds plants here right, and they are not the plants like the Germans they are not assembly plants, they make everything here, so they are brought up, constantly as the paradigm, like why can\u2019t you guys be like Korea? Where all the intellectual property is made here. And I think it\u2019s rather amazing. . .I brought them up as being why are they getting a free ride to some people? And they said no, there\u2019s no free ride, they actually listened to what we wanted.\u201d Of course, since China is the President\u2019s first target when it comes to negotiations, it was unsurprising that the country came up. Cramer isn\u2019t a fan of China. What amazed Cramer was Hayman Capital Management founder and CIO, Kyle Bass\u2019s comments where he outlined \u201cone country lies, one country doesn\u2019t. . .China lies. Look I find these talks unfathomable. I don\u2019t see any progress.\u201d As for who has the cards in the negotiations between the US and China, Cramer said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s the problem. We don\u2019t know.\u201d To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on April 25th. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world\u2019s leading AI GPU designer. While it became the world\u2019s most valuable company due to its exposure to AI spending and data centers, the fall has been equally remarkable. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s shares have lost 21% year-to-date as the stock has struggled after the DeepSeek selloff. Cramer\u2019s previous remarks about the company have stressed that it continues to enjoy exposure to data center demand. His recent thoughts built on the theme: \u201cOkay so I\u2019m gonna give you, how to read that, you can dismiss it, but I\u2019ll give it to you. Taiwan Semi, discount versus NVIDIA is how you look at it. The Taiwan Semi, the discount, it\u2019s 17 versus 23 times earnings, that is simply the discount of, a, I don\u2019t wanna say it, takeover, because that gets people scared. But an encroachment by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

It operated about 70 such facilities at the end of 2023, Amazon spokesperson Alexa Clark said, declining to specify say how many the company operates today. By the end of 2026, Amazon said, it will have invested $4 billion total in the project. The largest online retailer has spent the past decade building a massive logistics operation that includes hundreds of warehouses in and around major cities and a network of bespoke contractors that hire drivers who pilot blue Amazon-branded vans. Businesses across sectors have meanwhile faced pressure to announce US spending pledges since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, vowing to revive the economy and bring back American jobs. Major tech companies in particular, including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., have laid out plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the US. Amazon executives earlier this year discussed trying to make an announcement with Trump about the company\u2019s own US spending, Bloomberg has reported. For rural areas, Amazon historically handed off most of shipments to carriers like the US Postal Service or United Parcel Service Inc. UPS said this week that it expected to cut 20,000 jobs this year and close dozens of facilities as it reduces shipments for Amazon. The ecommerce giant estimates the rural network initiative will have created 100,000 jobs, including the direct employees who staff Amazon\u2019s warehouses and drivers who employed by contractors. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Amazon was considering a $15 billion warehouse expansion, including delivery hubs, a move that would reverse the company\u2019s post-pandemic construction slowdown.

The rally clawed back losses from earlier in the day, after the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP)shrank in the first quarter. It was the first downturn in economic output since the opening quarter of 2022. The afternoon rebound resulted in the S&P 500 ending the day up 0.2% and the Dow industrials rose 0.4%. Meanwhile the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped less than 0.1% on Wednesday. Super Micro Computer (SMCI)\u00a0shares plunged 11.5%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock, after preliminary quarterly results from the maker of servers and data storage systems came inbelow its previous forecasts. Supermicro cited timing issues affecting its sales during the period as customers push back purchases into the next fiscal quarter. Edison International (EIX) declined 8.9% on Wednesday. The utility company reported better-than-expected first-quarter profits and boosted its full-year earnings outlook, but quarterly sales fell short of estimates. The company also indicated that its Southern California Edison subsidiary could incur significant losses related to the Eaton fire. AccordingThe Los Angeles Times, ongoing investigations have yet to pinpoint Edison's equipment as a source of the blaze, but without any additional evidence, the power provider could face liabilities. Shares of fitness and navigation device manufacturer Garmin (GRMN) dropped 8.4% following mixed first-quarter earnings results. Although sales for the period exceeded forecasts, profits missed expectations. An operating loss in Garmin's auto original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment contributed to the earnings shortfall. However, the company benefited from positive sales momentum in its outdoor, fitness, aviation, and marine businesses. Hard disk drive and solid state drive manufacturer Seagate Technology (STX) reported better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal third quarter, which ended in March, and provided an upbeat forecast for the current quarter. Robust demand for the company's heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) storage technology helped underpin the strong performance. Seagate shares surged 11.6%, securing the S&P 500's top daily performance. Strong quarterly results also helped lift shares of Trane Technologies (TT), which jumped 8.5% after the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) firm topped first-quarter sales and profit estimates. Solid organic revenue growth contributed to the Ireland-based company's performance during the quarter. Shares of Western Digital (WDC) jumped 8.0% after the data storage provider exceeded estimates with its quarterly sales and profits. Western Digital also initiated a new quarterly dividend program.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang discussed the company\u2019s recently announced $500 billion agreement to manufacture the most advanced AI chips in the United States with President Donald Trump at a White House event on Wednesday. This marks the first time such technology will be produced entirely domestically. NVIDIA, known for reinventing computing, aims to leverage artificial intelligence and robotics to create state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Huang highlighted the significance of this technological leap, noting that the computer architecture has remained largely unchanged since the 1960s. He emphasized that the new NVIDIA processors, weighing 70 pounds and consisting of 60,000 parts, represent the next generation of computing. The complexity of these chips is such that their manufacturing and testing require advanced robotics and even a supercomputer, respectively. The NVIDIA CEO credited President Trump\u2019s leadership and policies for accelerating the pace of manufacturing in the U.S., stating that modern manufacturing is driven by technology rather than low-cost labor. Huang expressed gratitude for the administration\u2019s support, which includes an industry-oriented energy policy essential for the growth of new industries like artificial intelligence. Huang conveyed that the support from the Trump administration is crucial for fostering the new AI industry, which he believes will revolutionize various sectors such as healthcare, financial services, and education. He stressed the importance of having the fundamental infrastructure for AI in the United States to enable innovation across these industries. The partnership with the U.S. government signifies a major step for NVIDIA and the technology sector, with the potential to transform the landscape of artificial intelligence and manufacturing. The White House event served as a platform to underscore the collaborative effort between the administration and NVIDIA in shaping the future of AI and industry in America.
