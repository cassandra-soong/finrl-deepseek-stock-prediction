        "content": "US stock futures jumped Monday night followingPresident Trump's decision to delay a broad 50% tariff on all EU productsfrom June to July to allow time for negotiations. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) rose 0.9%, with S&P 500 contracts (ES=F) flying up 1.1%. Futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) surged 1.3%. The jumps followed Trump\u2019s Sunday announcement that he would postpone a 50% tariff on EU imports until July 9. The move came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said in a post on X that theEU is ready to engage in swift and decisive negotiations. Trump's pledge for 50% tariffs on Fridayled markets lower, with Memorial Day closures delaying market responses to the on-again, off-again levies. All three major indexes saw falls of at least 2% last week, with tariff uncertainty and debt concernsleading the negative sentiment. Trump also aimed his ire at smartphone makers on Friday, declaring that a 25% duty would be placed on all imported smartphones, specifically urging companies like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (005930.KS) to relocate production to the US. Investors are now turning their attention to abusy week of economic data, including reports on durable goods orders, housing, and consumer confidence. Market watchers will also hear from Federal Reserve officials who are expected to hold rates steady in line with previous direction.Trump's contentious tax billis also on the docket, having narrowly made it through the US House last week. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) isset to take the spotlight on Wednesdaywith the quarter'smost anticipated earnings results.

        "content": "In 2023 and 2024,Nvidia(NVDA-1.02%)pretty much equaled a ticket to an investment win. Over that time period, shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant skyrocketed, gaining more than 800%. This was thanks to the company's dominance in the high-growth market that supercharged earnings quarter after quarter. A bet on Nvidia was a bet on AI -- and investors were eager to get in on this technology that's often seen as the next big thing. But Nvidia hasn't been such a sure thing for investors this year. Like many other stocks, particularly growth players, it's tumbled amid concern about the potential impact of President Trump's import tariffs on the economy -- and eventually corporate earnings. Nvidia shares have rebounded from lows, but they're still down about 1% for the year. This week, though, Nvidia is heading toward a moment that could offer the stock direction. I'm talking about the company's fiscal 2026 first-quarter earnings report. Will Nvidia stock soar after May 28? History offers us a decidedly clear answer. Image source: Getty Images. First, though, a quick note about Nvidia's earnings performance so far and the general AI environment. Companies have been pouring investment into their AI programs, and as part of that, they've flocked to Nvidia for its topgraphics processing units(GPUs) and related products and services. Analysts expect the AI market to roar past $2 trillion early in the next decade as more and more companies jump on board the AI train. Nvidia, which already is greatly benefiting from the AI boom, could be one of the biggest winners of this long-term growth story. So far, the company has reported many quarters of double- and triple-digit revenue growth, with revenue and net income reaching records. And profit on sales is high, with gross margin surpassing 70%. All of this has helped drive Nvidia stock higher. As I mentioned, the president'stariff planhalted the momentum as investors worried about potentially higher prices and even a U.S. recession. In that sort of environment, customers could cut back on AI spending, and that would hurt Nvidia. Butrecent trade dealswith the U.K. and China have boosted optimism that import tariff levels won't be as steep as initially announced, averting a major slowdown. That's helped Nvidia and other growth stocks to rebound in recent days. Now, let's consider Nvidia's upcoming earnings report. The chip giant has a record of beating analysts' estimates and announcing positive news such as the successful launch of its Blackwell architecture during the last earnings period. Blackwell brought in $11 billion in revenue during that time, its first quarter of commercialization. There's reason to be optimistic about the report ahead, and we're already prepared for one particular negative point since Nvidia announced it a few weeks ago: a $5.5 billion charge related to U.S. restrictions on the export of its chips to China. So that piece of news shouldn't impact stock performance following the earnings announcement. Considering all of this, will Nvidia soar on its earnings news? A look at history offers us some clues. I took a look at Nvidia's stock performance in the six months following the seven quarterly earnings reports from May 2023 through November 2024. (I didn't include the latest report, from this February, since six months haven't yet passed.) During the first five periods, Nvidia stock soared in the double-digits from the report through the following six months. Gains ranged from 50% to 90%. Only after the past two earnings reports has Nvidia declined in the six-month period -- and it's important to keep two things in mind regarding these declines. First, they've been small, at less than 1% in the six months following the August 2024 earnings report and in the single digits following the November 2024 report. And second, the losses came mainly early this year, as part of the concern about Trump's tariffs and a general question about the future of AI spending. (That spending question was resolved after big Nvidia customers includingMeta PlatformsandAlphabetreiterated their AI investment plans for the year.) Now let's consider what this tells us about Nvidia's performance post-May 28. If history is right, Nvidia is on track to soar, and in a big way, after its earnings report as this has happened most frequently in the past. That said, the declines we've seen after the past two earnings reports were heavily linked to tariff uncertainty. Though the tariff situation has improved, until the issue is completely resolved, it could represent a potential headwind for Nvidia's stock performance. So all of this shows us that, yes, history says Nvidia could be heading for double-digit gains in the months to follow its earnings report -- but it's important to be aware that an unexpected economic or political issue could get in the way. The good news, though, is history shows us one other thing: Nvidia always has recovered from losses in the past and gone on to advance. And the company's strong competitive position and presence in a high growth market should help it do that again if it encounters tough times. And that means, whether Nvidia soars after May 28 or not, it still is very likely to win over the long term.",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose sharply on Monday evening as investors were relieved by President Donald Trump postponing plans to impose steep trade tariffs on the European Union. Trading volumes were dull on account of the Memorial Day holiday, although futures pointed to a recovery after Wall Street sank on Friday. Focus this week is also on quarterly earnings from artificial intelligence major NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which are due on Wednesday and set to offer more cues on the fast-growing AI industry. Nvidia\u2019s earnings are expected to act as a bellwether for the broader tech sector. S&P 500 Futures rose 1.1% to 5,879.25 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 1.3% to 21,236.50 points by 19:11 ET (23:11 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose nearly 1% to 42,069.0 points. Trump said on Sunday evening that he had agreed to postpone his recently proposed 50% tariffs on the EU to July 9, following a seemingly productive call with EU President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump also said that his administration will begin trade talks in earnest with the EU, while Von Der Leyen also flagged improving relations with Washington. The development offered some relief to markets, which were rattled by Trump threatening steep tariffs on the EU on Friday. But markets still remained on edge over Trump also threatening tariffs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other smartphone imports, demanding that they be manufactured domestically. Apple shares slid 3% on Friday. The July 9 deadline is also around when Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs are set to take effect, with focus also on whether major U.S. trading partners can clinch agreements with Washington before the deadline. The S&P 500 fell 0.7% to 5,802.82 points on Friday, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 1% to 18,737.21 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% to 41,603.07 points. Nvidia is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with focus squarely on whether AI demand remained strong. The company is considered a bellwether for global AI demand, especially in the chipmaking sector, and is sitting on a massive valuation spike over the past two years on this position. Nvidia is expected to clock bumper earnings, especially as Wall Street\u2019s so-called AI Hyperscalers\u2013 its biggest customers\u2013 continued to spend heavily on AI over the past three months. Focus will also be on how the company intends to navigate tougher U.S. export controls, which have essentially blocked it from China, which is still a major market for the chipmaker.

        "header": "Meet the Monster Quantum Computing Stock That Continues to Crush the Market",
        "content": "When thinking about quantum computing, names such asNvidia,Alphabet,Microsoft, orAmazonmight come to mind. Each of these companies has developed custom chips and software focused on quantum computing technology -- providing them with even more opportunity to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. But what if I told you that over the last year, Nvidia is the only stock in this peer set that has generated a better total return than theS&P 500andNasdaq Composite? Beyond the megacap technology stocks,IonQ(IONQ-0.26%)has emerged as a budding opportunity in the quantum computing realm. Over the last year, IonQ stock has risen by a staggering 432% -- absolutely crushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes, which have risen by 11% and 13%, respectively. Is IonQ stock set up to continue beating the market? Read on to find out. It's important to understand that when a new megatrend emerges, individual opportunities underneath the broader umbrella tend to follow. What I mean by that is throughout the AI revolution, investors have (for the most part) been following the same subsectors such as enterprise software, cloud computing infrastructure, and semiconductor chips. While quantum computing is an enormous market opportunity, it's not exactly scaling at the same pace as chips or software right now. For this reason, I tend to view quantum computing as more of a trendy, new pocket of the AI realm that appears promising but has little traction to prove it.  IONQdata byYCharts Not even a year ago, IonQ was trading nearpenny stocklevels. Still, despite a nearly sevenfold rise in its share price, IonQ stock is \"only\" $45. Well, smart investors understand that share price is only one parameter when assessing a company's valuation. Let's dig into IonQ's financial profile to help assess if the stock is overvalued or trading for a reasonable price. Image source: Getty Images. Over the last year, IonQ generated $43 million in revenue. Sure, the company's sales trajectory might look encouraging, but look at that cash burn. While raking in tens of millions in revenue, IonQ burned through more than $300 million -- and the trend is getting worse!  IONQ Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts Despite this inverse relationship between sales and profits, IonQ's market cap has continued to soar. At an $11.7 billion market capitalization, IonQ currently trades for aprice-to-sales(P/S) multiple of 238. That is almost tenfold the P/S ratio of Nvidia. I think IonQ is a speculative stock to own and itsvaluation seems unjustifiedto me. While the stock has outperformed the broader market over the last year, I suspect much of the rise in the share price has to do with optimistic narratives surrounding quantum computing coupled with investor fatigue in the usual suspects (i.e., the \"Magnificent Seven\"). While I'm intrigued by quantum computing, it's not an area that's enticed me enough to follow the momentum currently fueling IonQ stock to new highs. Instead, owning stocks such as Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, or evenIBMcan provide investors with exposure to quantum computing while also achieving some level of insulation since you will be diversified in other areas of the broader AI market, too. I would pass on IonQ stock right now. Given its parabolic rise in such a short time frame, I think it's more likely the stock will take a breather rather than continue crushing the market.",

Kurzweil's long-held vision of a future dominated by intelligent machines is moving from bookshelves to production lines. His prediction that artificial intelligence would exceed human intelligence by 2045 once raised eyebrows, Reuters reports. According toBloomberg, AI startups raised a record $97 billion in funding in 2024 alone, making artificial intelligence one of the most heavily backed sectors in venture capital. According to Gauntlet Ventures co-founderOliver Carmack, the decision to back Beyond Imagination stemmed from the company\u2019s capacity to address a looming global issue: the skilled labor shortage. The startup's bot, with its AI-driven adaptability, is being positioned as a solution for industries like pharmaceutical manufacturing, chip fabrication, and automotive assembly, sectors that demand high precision and long-term workforce support, Reuters says.

According to Beyond Imagination\u2019s website, its advisory board includes former Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) CEOPaul Jacobs, motivational speaker and business strategistTony Robbins, and former Paramount Pictures ChairJim Gianopulos. Their backing, combined with Gauntlet's $100 million investment, sets Beyond Imagination apart in a market flooded with robotics startups vying for capital and attention. According to Reuters, Gauntlet Ventures is the sole investor in this Series B round, a bold show of confidence in both Kurzweil's vision and the company's near-term commercial potential. This latest funding round comes at a time when several major players are entering or expanding their own robotics divisions. Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Optimus robot, Meta's (NASDAQ:META) AI systems, and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) development tools are all pushing the industry forward. Kurzweil's company is positioning Aura as a system designed to integrate humans, robots, and legacy machinery, Reuters says. See Also:Elon Musk Told The U.N.

According toVox, while chatbots and other language-based AIs have surged ahead, powered by vast amounts of readily available training data from text, images, and video, physical robots remain years behind. Unlike language models, which can be trained in parallel across millions of central processing unit cores and datasets scraped from the internet, robots need to learn by interacting with the physical world in real time, Vox says. As industrial sectors look for automation that delivers beyond traditional robotics, Beyond Imagination may lead that charge with fresh capital and an AI strategy focused on industrial deployment.

According to data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA), Tesla's (TSLA) registrations in the European Union fell 52% year-on-year in April, dropping to 5,475 vehicles from 11,540 in the same month of 2024. Across the broader EU, EFTA and UK region, sales were down 49% The sharp decline comes as Tesla (TSLA) continues to face reputational challenges linked to Musk\u2019s public political affiliations. The billionaire entrepreneur has drawn criticism for his vocal support of US president Donald Trump, sparking protests at Tesla showrooms across Europe earlier this year. Over the first four months of 2025, Tesla (TSLA) sales in Europe have fallen nearly 40% compared to the same period last year.

In a recent public address, he said he intends to remain at the helm of Tesla (TSLA) for at least the next five years. Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) traded lower ahead of the US market open, as investors looked ahead to the chipmaker\u2019s eagerly anticipated earnings report, due after the bell on Wednesday. The consensus among analysts is that Nvidia (NVDA) will post earnings of 73 cents per share for the first quarter, up 16% from a year earlier, on revenue of $43.4bn (\u00a332bn) \u2014 a 66% year-on-year increase. However, expectations have softened in recent weeks, with earnings forecasts falling from 93 cents per share 60 days ago. Nvidia (NVDA), whose graphics processing units are central to the global artificial intelligence boom, has a track record of outperforming forecasts. AJ Bell's (AJB.L) investment experts, Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth said that Nvidia (NVDA) \"has had the happy knack of beating estimates, which on this occasion will be benchmarked against the guidance given by chief executive Jensen Huang alongside the full-year results back in February. Just as important will be any steer or forecasts for the second quarter, which runs from May through to July.\" Read more:Stocks to watch this week: Nvidia, Salesforce, Dell, Costco and Kingfisher Nvidia's report is likely to have a broader market impact, given its heavyweight status in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index. Investors are expected to scrutinise the results for signs of how AI-related demand \u2014 and fears of increased competition and tariffs \u2014 may affect the sector more widely. Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) are broadly flat for the year to date, after volatile trading driven by geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over the pace of AI investment. Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for around 17% of the S&P 500\u2019s total gains. GameStop (GME) shares were trending in pre-market trading as the videogame retailer and original meme stock is set to report results June 9 which will show how much bitcoin (BTC-USD) it may have bought. Analysts now forecast GameStop (GME) will generate $3.56bn in sales for the current fiscal year \u2014 down from $3.82bn last year \u2014 and project a further decline to $3.13bn in fiscal 2026, reflecting continued pressure on its core retail operations. Based on these figures, the company\u2019s average sales run rate over the next 12 months would fall to roughly $3.35bn. Despite the deteriorating sales outlook, recent gains in GameStop\u2019s (GME) share price have been driven not by company fundamentals but by broader crypto market momentum. Bitcoin hit an all-time intraday high of $111,986.44 and a record closing high of $111,226.68 last week, boosting companies perceived to have crypto exposure. GameStop (GME) has thrown its support behind digital assets. Earlier this year, its board unanimously approved an update to the company\u2019s investment policy, allowing bitcoin to be used as a treasury reserve asset. Shares in Palantir (PLTR) rose 3% in pre-market trading on Tuesday, as enthusiasm over the data analytics company\u2019s exposure to artificial intelligence and a wave of new government contracts continued to support investor confidence. The stock has surged nearly 62% since the start of 2025, outperforming most of its tech-sector peers, though analysts caution that the rally has come with a steep valuation. The company has benefited from increasing enterprise demand for streamlined data operations, as well as momentum from a proposed federal overhaul led by the Musk-chaired Department of Government Efficiency under Trump.

Meanwhile, securities filings show that chief executive Alex Karp sold more than $50mn worth of stock last week. The transactions took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, with shares trading between $125.26 and $127.70. Premier Inn owner Whitbread (WTB.L) has named Christine Hodgson, who is currently at the helm of Severn Trent (SVT.L), as its new chairwoman. Hodgson will join the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) company on September 1, replacing current chairman Adam Crozier, who has been in post since 2018. She has been working as chairwoman of water giant Severn Trent (SVT.L) since 2020, overseeing its recent decision to hike consumer bills by an average 47% over the next five years. Hodgson\u2019s appointment comes after the hospitality giant revealed a drop in profits on the back of recent restaurant closures and softening demand for hotel rooms in the UK. Whitbread (WTB.L), which also owns Beefeater restaurants, said earlier in May that profits fell by 14% in the year to February, compared with the previous year. It said this was partly driven by the impact of a growth strategy that the company started last April, which includes an overhaul of its restaurant business. The \u00a3500m plan, which executives dubbed \u201cAccelerating Growth\u201d, involved converting 112 branded restaurants and selling 126 more. Hodgson said: \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to be joining, as the company continues to deliver on its five-year plan, and Premier Inn\u2019s expansion in Germany gathers pace.\u201d The company hopes this will help it build about 3,500 extra hotel rooms, eventually reaching 97,000 rooms in total.

        "header": "Nvidia's $43 billion question: Can Jensen Huang keep the AI hype train on track?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has become the almost undisputed poster child of the AI boom \u2014 and now it\u2019s time to show the receipts. The $3.3 trillion chipmaker will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings for 2026 on Wednesday, and expectations are enormous. Analysts forecast a revenue surge to $43.26 billion, nearly 66% higher than the same quarter a year ago, with adjusted earnings per share jumping to $0.88 from $0.61, a growth of about 44%. Still, those forecasts might be selling the semiconductor giant short. The company has a habit of surpassing earnings expectations \u2014 topping earnings estimates by an average of about 7% in the last two quarters. Nvidia, whose chips have become the backbone of modern artificial intelligence, has been on a staggering run. But with stakes this high, investors are laser-focused on whether Nvidia\u2019s latest bets \u2014 such as its next-gen Blackwell platform, deepening cloud partnerships, and response to U.S.-China chip tensions \u2014 will deliver the kind of blockbuster quarter the markets have come to expect. At the heart of Nvidia\u2019s revenue machine is its Data Center business, which has grown into its largest and most profitable segment thanks to insatiable demand from cloud providers, AI startups, and enterprise customers building foundation models. Analysts expect this division alone to generate $21.27 billion in Q1 revenue. CEO Jensen Huang has positioned Nvidia not just as a chipmaker butas the infrastructure layer powering the AI revolution. The company is hoping that narrative continues with Blackwell, the GPU architecture introduced in March that Huang says will unlock the training and deployment of models that are orders of magnitude more powerful than current systems. The flagship GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip is already being integrated by hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AMZN), Google Cloud (GOOGL), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL). Nvidia may be dominant, but it\u2019s not operating in a vacuum. Rival chipmakers like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are racing to close the performance gap, while companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on custom silicon to reduce reliance on third-party GPUs. At the same time, a wave of Chinese AI chipmakers is emerging as Nvidia contends with export restrictions, creating fresh competitive pressure in one of its most important markets. But Nvidia isn\u2019t just about GPUs anymore. As investor expectations climb, the company is quietly broadening its AI stack \u2014 moving beyond silicon into networking, software, and cloud integration in a bid to become the full-stack backbone of AI infrastructure. Nvidia is deepening its economic moat and creating more stable, recurring revenue streams that could smooth earnings volatility over time. Through partnerships with major cloud providers, Nvidia is embedding itself into the very platforms AI developers rely on. Basically: Nvidia is trying to become more than just a supplier of AI tools. The company wants to become a critical platform for AI development itself. Investors will be watching closely for clear evidence that Nvidia\u2019s expansion beyond GPUs is starting to pay off in revenue. Wall Street wants to see whether the company\u2019s networking products are contributing to meaningful growth within the data center segment. Margins will also be a key focus. Networking and software typically deliver higher profitability than hardware, so any signs of margin expansion would support the narrative that Nvidia is transforming into a more durable, high-margin platform business. (Which could reassure investors that Nvidia\u2019s growth is sustainable and not just tied to cyclical chip demand.) Finally, Wall Street will listen for signs that Nvidia\u2019s AI software stack is gaining adoption among large enterprises outside the hyperscaler ecosystem \u2014 into sectors such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing \u2014 which would highlight the long-term potential of Nvidia\u2019s platform strategy and reinforce the company\u2019s role as the backbone of AI development. There is, of course, a major x-factor: China. Nvidia is ground zero inthe U.S.-China tech rivalry\u2014 its GPUs might just be the most valuable components in the AI arms race, and its position is increasingly shaped by policy, not just engineering. Nvidia has long relied on the Chinese market for a sizable chunk of its revenue, but that has changed dramatically in the wake of tightening U.S. export controls and tariffs. Huang said recently that years of U.S. restrictions on AI chip exportswere a strategic misfirethat cost Nvidia billions and handed Chinese rivals a powerful incentive to innovate. Nvidia, which was once dominant in China with a market share approaching 95% at the start of the Biden administration, now holds just 50%, Huang has said. To defend \u2014 and expand \u2014 its foothold, Nvidia is looking to establish an R&D center in Shanghai and is reportedly preparing further downgraded chip models that comply with U.S. rules. Investors will be looking to see the impact of U.S. export controls: how much they\u2019ve dented sales, whether downgraded chips can sustain demand in China, and more. Wall Street will also be watching for any supply chain stress; Nvidia relies heavily on TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing, and its capacity constraints remain a gating factor. While the company remains dominant in many global markets \u2014 and is expanding into the Middle East throughSaudi Arabia, in what one analyst calleda \u201cwatershed moment,\u201dand theUnited Arab Emirates\u2014 Wall Street will be looking for updates on how Nvidia plans to navigate what could be its most challenging international landscape in years. Nvidia is the poster child of the AI trade, and its financial performance serves as a high-frequency indicator of how far the generative AI economy has progressed from hype to hard returns. A strong beat would signal that tech giants (see: Microsoft, Google, Amazon) are continuing to pour billions into AI infrastructure, reaffirming the AI investment thesis that has largely powered the Nasdaq\u2019s rally. Nvidia\u2019s valuation is rich, but so are many other AI-linked names. If Nvidia meets or beats expectations, it could justify the current risk appetite for high-growth names. But a miss, even a tiny one, could trigger a sentiment reset. If forward guidance is strong, it\u2019ll show that enterprises are starting to spend on AI beyond experiments \u2014 e.g., in areas such as software integration, inference, and LLM deployment. Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on quite a wild ride in 2025. After hitting a high earlier in the year, shares fell amid broader market turbulence and investor anxiety about whether the AI trade had gotten overheated. President Donald Trump\u2019s April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201dannouncementsent the stock into a sharp dip, but it has since rebounded. Now, this quarter\u2019s results could be a clearing event that could reestablish momentum. One looming concern: supply chain capacity. Demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips continues to exceed supply, and while the company has worked to scale production, it may still be leaving money on the table simply due to how long it takes to manufacture and deliver its most advanced products. Investors will also be watching closely for details on capital expenditures and supply chain resilience. Wall Street will want to see how aggressively Nvidia is investing to expand capacity, whether through additional foundry partnerships or securing more critical components. Any signs that supply constraints are easing \u2014 or worsening \u2014 could influence how sustainable current growth trajectories appear. But the big question now is whether Nvidia can not only meet but beat expectations \u2014 something it has done consistently. While Nvidia remains possibly the most important company in the world\u2019s hottest tech sector, that also means the pressure is greater than ever.

        "content": "Many sports fans may know David Tepper as the owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers. But in the investing world, Tepper is considered a legend. Between 1993 and 2019, Tepper's fund, Appaloosa Management, generated compound annual returns of more than 25% per year, net of all fees, according to Institutional Investor. Today, Tepper still runs Appaloosa but as a family office,  and he's still arguably one of the most influential investors in the market. In the first quarter of 2025, filings show that Appaloosa more than halved its position in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giantNvidia(NVDA-1.02%), while loading up on a market-beating transportation stock instead. Like many stocks in 2025, Nvidia has had an up-and-down year. It sold off intensely but then rebounded and is currently down only 2% for the year. Earlier in 2025, there were many concerning events that could have caused investors to press the sell button. Image source: Getty Images. The first occurred after China's DeepSeek created anartificial intelligencechatbot rivaling OpenAI's ChatGPT, supposedly at a fraction of the cost and with older Nvidia chips. Now, there's much dispute about the level of resources that went into DeepSeek but it caused investors to worry about demand for Nvidia's chips and whether or not more in the AI world could be done with less. Then there were concerns about export restrictions and how that might impact Nvidia's business in China. Former President Joe Biden's administration began to limit the types of chips Nvidia could sell to China, in an effort to prevent China from obtaining semiconductors it could use to build a super computer. Those restrictions ramped up and the Biden administration also tried to close loopholes by preventing Nvidia from selling certain chips to other countries that could then sell them to China. The Trump administration plans to remove some of the Biden-era policies  but also implemented its own restrictions that caused Nvidia to take a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter of the year. While there is still broader market uncertainty, particularly as U.S. Treasury yields surged, investors seem to have renewed faith in AI demand and Nvidia currently trades at a cheaper forward earnings multiple than earlier this year, so it's not a bad time for long-term oriented buyers to buy shares or start dollar-cost averaging again.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts While selling Nvidia, Tepper and Appaloosa more than doubled their position in the ride-sharing companyUber Technologies(UBER-0.16%). Uber was one of the most highly touted start-ups, but struggled to turn a profit for many years. In 2017, the company brought on Dara Khosrowshahi, who has focused less on growth and more on improving operations. Through a mixture of cost-cutting, price increases, exiting difficult markets like China, and a focus on growing profitable businesses like Uber Eats, Uber managed to turn its first profit in 2023. Since then, profits and revenue continued to grow  and the company has also been increasing free cash flow. The stock has crushed the broader market this year and over the last five years.  UBERdata byYCharts Uber also has an opportunity to be a part of the autonomous vehicle wave. While the company will not build its own self-driving vehicles, it does plan to partner with companies in the autonomous space to help them reach commercialization and integrate autonomous vehicles into Uber's fleet. In a presentation made in the fourth quarter of 2024, management presented the autonomous space as more thana $1 trillion opportunity. The company said that the path to commercialization for companies developing self-driving vehicles faces several obstacles. These include navigating the regulatory landscape, ensuring safety, and having a scalable network and platform. Uber can help on all of these fronts and has already partnered with several large autonomous companies like Waymo and WeRide. Earlier this month, Uber and WeRide announce an expansion of their partnership to roll out autonomous vehicles in 15 cities across the world. Trading at less than 25 times forward earnings, Uber has the opportunity to continue improving profitability and free cash flow, while also potentially tapping into the massive autonomous market over time, presenting a potential new stream of revenue.",

Investors want to know, is now the time to buy tech, especially with Nvidia's make or break earnings just days away? Now lately, Nvidia has been driving over 10% of tech sector returns and nearly 6% of the entire S&P 500. I'm Jared Blickery, host of Stocks and Translation. Check out this chart here. Relative strength and Nvidia. This is against the Spider XLK. So Nvidia divided by XLK, from 2016 through 2023, Nvidia was tech's unstoppable force, riding the AI wave higher. But notice the shift over the past year. The ratio has flattened out. Those pink dots, those are earnings dates. And the last four reports did not create new highs in relative strength, as they have in recent years. So the question for investors is, is Nvidia losing its edge? Now let's take a look at correlation. How closely tech tracks Nvidia at 0.85, and it only goes up to one. This is near the highest levels since the AI boom kicked off. Tech stocks now move in Nvidia's shadow. That means if Nvidia misses, the whole sector feels the pain. And if you're underinvested, when Nvidia soars, you miss out big time. So combine both of these charts, and you can clearly see stalling leadership and sky high correlation. They spell asymmetric risk ahead of the earnings print. If Nvidia delivers a blowout, then tech likely moves higher, but the gains might not be broader. So, if Nvidia disappoints, expect tech stocks to drop in lockstep. The bottom line for investors, short-term traders might scale in or hedge ahead of the report, but longer-term investors, ask yourself, is Nvidia still the engine of tech, or has it turned into a potential liability?

        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa (Reuters) - Nvidia investors will look for definitive answers on how much U.S. chip curbs on China will cost the company when it reports results on Wednesday, even as a pullback in other regulations is expected to open up new markets. In a fresh effort to stymie Beijing's access to cutting-edge technology, theTrumpadministration last month put export limits on Nvidia's H20 chip - a move the company said would result in $5.5 billion in charges. CEO Jensen Huang, who pegged the market for AI chips in China at roughly $50 billion next year, said last week Nvidia had walked away from $15 billion of sales in the country after the curbs. Nvidia does not break out sales for the H20, the only AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, a market which accounted for 13% of its revenue last year. \"The primary question around results and guidance is can Nvidia lift sales enough to offset the loss of H20 or China business,\" Wedbush analysts said ahead of the earnings report. While sources have told Reuters that company is planning to launch a new AI chipset for China based on Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell architecture, the uncertainty of losing its China business has dented its stock. The stock has already been under pressure from concerns about mounting AI infrastructure costs. It was down 2% this year, a far cry from their nearly three-fold gain last year. \"China will probably be the biggest swing factor for Nvidia's quarter,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. The company is expected to report that first-quarter revenue surged 66.2% to $43.28 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Susquehanna analysts estimated the restrictions impacted the last three weeks of the April quarter, costing Nvidia about $1 billion in sales. For the rest of the year, lost revenue could amount to as much as $4.5 billion per quarter, they said. Wedbush estimated the quarterly hit at $3 billion to $4 billion. Adjusted gross margin is expected to drop more than 11 percentage points to 67.7%. The write-downs related to H20 shipments could translate to a gross margin hit of up to 12.5%, Wedbush said. Nvidia CEO Huang recently called U.S. semiconductor curbs on China \"a failure,\" saying they have only pushed Chinese rivals such as Huawei to speed up development of homegrown chips. NEW REGIONS Washington, however, has said it is going to modify a Biden-era export curb called the AI diffusion rule that sought to curb exports of sophisticated AI chips by dividing the world into three tiers, with China blocked entirely. This easing could open up new geographies of growth for Nvidia including the Middle East, though analysts say the region's revenue contribution in the near term will be small. As part of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade deals with some Gulf countries, Nvidia has said it would sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips to Saudi Arabia, including 18,000 of its latest \"Blackwell\" chips to a startup owned by the country's sovereign wealth fund. After months of worries that investment in AI from large cloud providers was stalling, Nvidia investors have found confidence in pledges from companies including Alphabet's Google to keep spending. Still, the quarters of blowout beats may be over for the company. In its last fiscal year, Nvidia beat Wall Street's quarterly revenue estimates by 4.9% on average. It delivered quarterly sales that was 12.5% above estimates in the fiscal year preceding that. \"I don't think investors expectations are very high as we go into it (results),\" said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer of Spear Invest, which holds Nvidia shares in an actively managed exchange-traded fund.

        "content": "TheS&P 500is widely considered to be the best indicator of how the U.S. stock market is doing, and it's easy to understand why. After all, it contains 500 of the largest companies in the United States, and these collectively represent 80% of the overall value of all publicly traded companies. However, one characteristic of the S&P 500 that is very important for investors to understand is that it's a weighted index, which means that larger companies account for a greater percentage of the index's performance. And with the rise of trillion-dollar megacap technology companies over the past decade or so, this weighting has resulted in a rather high concentration in just a few big companies. Image source: Getty Images. For example, the largest companies in the United States,Apple(AAPL-2.88%)andMicrosoft(MSFT-0.82%), make up 6.8% and 6.2% of the entire weighting of theS&P 500, respectively. The 10 largest companies in the index make up 35.6% of the S&P 500's performance. That's more than the smallest 300 components of the indexcombined. In simple terms, I like the idea of investing in 500 of the largest and most successful U.S. companies. But I don't like that much of my investment performance dependent on just a few stocks, while hundreds of others barely have any impact on my long-term returns. TheInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF(RSP-0.29%)solves this problem. It invests in the same 500 companies as anS&P 500 index fund, except every single component has the same influence on the ETF's performance. That means companies such asGeneral Motors(GM-1.10%),Occidental Petroleum(OXY0.58%), andHormel Foods(HRL0.09%)carry the same weight as tech behemoths such as Apple, Microsoft, andNvidia(NVDA-1.02%). The idea is that if American business collectively performs well, you'll reap the benefits. But you also won't feel a significant sting if, say, Nvidia posts a bad quarterly report. Sure, you'll miss out on some of the benefits if massive companies perform well, but this tends to be offset over time by the greater exposure to smaller components of the S&P 500, which tend to have more dynamic growth potential. Speaking of growth potential, although theequal weightS&P 500 has underperformed the traditional version of the index during the megacap tech surge of the past few years, you might be surprised to learn that the equal weight index has actuallyoutperformedits weighted counterpart over the long run. In fact, over the past 40 years, the S&P 500 equal weight index has produced a total return that's more than 400 percentage points greater than the weighted S&P 500.  ^IQXdata byYCharts The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF has a 0.20% expense ratio, which is a bit higher than you'd pay for most standard S&P 500 index funds but is still on the low end for a specialized ETF product. There's nothing wrong with simply buying a traditional S&P 500 index fund and holding it for the long term. Doing so has historically been a strong wealth creation strategy, and in full disclosure, I own shares of theVanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO-0.57%)in my portfolio. However, the relative top-heaviness of the S&P 500 makes the index's performance disproportionately dependent on just a few companies, so if you aren't too comfortable with this level of concentration, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is an alternative that could be worth a closer look.",

        "content": "When it comes to the biggest companies developing artificial intelligence (AI), it's hard not to think about the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- that is,Microsoft,Nvidia,Apple,Alphabet,Amazon,Meta Platforms, andTesla(TSLA-0.33%). To a degree, however, Tesla is somewhat of an outlier in this cohort. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have already benefited immensely from AI adoption, particularly across cloud computing infrastructure. Apple and Meta are both working hard to integrate AI services into their devices and platforms. And of course, Nvidia's GPUs are a key piece of the hardware powering generative AI applications across the globe. But what about Tesla? Sure, the company develops autonomous driving software and has its sights on building a ride-hailing fleet, called theRobotaxi. But in my opinion, the AI thesis surrounding Tesla is currently more of a narrative than concrete reality. Although this may cause some investors to remain skeptical of Tesla and its ambitions, the company's eccentric chief executive officer, Elon Musk, has received a major nod of validation from none other than Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia. Let's explore why Huang is so impressed by Musk, and detail what could be in store at the intersection of Tesla and AI down the road. Musk manages a lot of other businesses beyond Tesla. In recent years, one of Musk's newer projects is a start-up calledxAI. xAI built a supercomputer calledColossus, which runs on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's GPU chipsets and isplanning on deploying more. While I'm sure Musk's decision to use Nvidia's chips earned him some brownie points with Huang, that's not why the Nvidia CEO praised what xAI is building. Rather, it's how xAI got Colossus up and running that caught Huang's attention. During an interview with venture capitalist Brad Gerstner, Huang said that designing and planning the infrastructure needed to build Colossus could take roughly three years, and then actually take another year to build the supercomputer. Musk and the xAI team built Colossus and had it running in 19 days! When singing his praise for Musk, Huang said that what xAI has done is \"singular.\" Image source: Getty Images. As I alluded to in the introduction, one of Tesla's main AI ambitions is building a fleet of autonomous robotaxis. Right now, Tesla trains its models for developing self-driving car software through a custom supercomputer calledDojo. While Dojo's capabilities are impressive, I think there is a unique opportunity for Musk to integrate xAI with Tesla's ecosystem. For example, when it comes to autonomous driving, Tesla's problem isn't collecting enough data. The company already has nearly 3.5 billion miles worth of data that's been captured. However, in order to scale its fleet and truly disrupt the ride-hailing market, Tesla also needs to be able to process data at faster speeds -- this is where Colossus could lend a hand. By augmenting the Dojo system with Colossus, I think Tesla could rapidly increase the pace at which the company trains its neural network needed to perfect the full self-driving (FSD) system. Byvertically integratingxAI with Tesla, Musk can build a lucrative flywheel between his AI enterprises. Tesla vehicles will continue capturing data from drivers, which xAI then uses to train FSD models faster, allowing Tesla to deploy these improved models back into its fleet -- ultimately strengthening the robotaxi network. Complementing xAI with Tesla also brings a subtle cost-saving opportunity in the form of reducedcapital expenditures(capex). By leveraging xAI, Tesla can achieve synergies across data compute and product integration costs -- thus providing the company with more financial flexibility and allowing it to rely less on external hardware vendors over time. Although the ideas explored in this piece might make you more encouraged about Tesla's AI ambitions, I must admit that, for now, these concepts are also just narratives as opposed to tangible opportunities. Nevertheless, recent price action suggests that investors are getting excited for Tesla's foray into the robotaxi market next month.  TSLAdata byYCharts A 50% rise in the share price in just one month makes me think a lot of the upside from the company's AI efforts is already priced into the stock. While I'm optimistic about Tesla's future, Iwouldn't chase momentumat these levels.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) bulls are riding hard for the stock, but there's still a valuable bear case for the world's most valuable chipmaker. Arguably the most important \"Magnificent Seven\" member, Nvidia reports earnings after market close on Wednesday, and the usual hype is hard to miss. The stock is up a sizzling 40% over the past year, but it's slightly down year to date due to concerns about artificial intelligence demand and China chip export controls. Analysts, however, are staying overwhelmingly bullish on one of their favorite stocks. Roughly 87% have a Buy rating, according toYahoo Finance data. The average price target is around $162, implying about 25% upside from current levels. \"We see a $5 trillion market cap on the horizon for the Godfather of AI, Jensen Huang, and Nvidia,\" Wedbush tech analystDan Ivestold Yahoo Finance. Nvidia'scurrent market cap stands at $3.21 trillion. But the stock is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 31 times forward earnings, the share price has surged more than 600% in the last three years, and its market cap briefly claimed the world's most valuable company title last week. Some industry pros are beginning to ask: How much of Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance is already priced in, and is there a downside surprise under the surface? Read more:How does Nvidia make money? It's a question worth pondering. For one, US export restrictions have cut Nvidia\u2019s China market share in half. Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang said the company has already walked away from $15 billion in China sales and written off a staggering $5.5 billion in inventory tied to its banned H20 AI chips. Plus, the competitive landscape is shifting. Cloud giants like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG) \u2014 Nvidia\u2019s top customers \u2014 areracing to build their own AI chips. Chinese firms like Huawei are also quickly closing the gap, according to Huang. Furthermore, upstarts like Groq, which raised $640 million in a Series D round last year, are reeling in big investors to fund their efforts to snatch a slice of the AI chip pie. Then there are the margins. Despite continued robust demand for Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell AI chips, the company\u2019s gross profit margins are compressing, pressured by rising data center costs and complex new hardware. Of note, a big-time bear on the stock, Michael Burry of Scion Asset Management, has bought put options on the stock, according to arecent SEC filing. The hedge fund manager, who rose to fame after accurately predicting the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, is betting the chipmaker\u2019s rally is running out of bandwidth. AI might be the future, but Nvidia\u2019s valuation may already be there. This week, we\u2019ll find out if its results were worth the hype.

Li\u2019s visit to Southeast Asia comes on the heel of President Xi Jinping\u2019s tour last month, when he called for a united Asian family in an apparent effort to counter US containment. \u201cCountries of the three sides are at different stages of development, yet we should not let these differences stand in a way of our cooperation, but transform them into complementary strength that we can harness,\u201d China\u2019s No. 2 said. Southeast Asia was hit with steep tariffs by Trump earlier this year, as Washington accused them of assisting with transshipment of cheap Chinese goods into the US. Asean and Gulf states also stand out as the Trump administration is hoping to ensure that companies building data centers in these countries don\u2019t use Chinese AI hardware. During Trump\u2019s whirlwind trip to the Middle East earlier this month, Washington announced deals to ship tens of thousands \u2014 and likely upwards of a million \u2014 advanced Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

It\u2019s centrality. Where\u2019s the focus? Welfare, well-being of all people, economic relations, trade, investments. So if it means working with the Chinese, yes, we\u2019ll do. The United States, yes, we have to,\u201d Anwar said in a briefing at the end of the summit. The Malaysian premier earlier in his opening remarks at the Asean-GCC-China Summit, highlighted the region\u2019s combined GDP of $24 trillion. Members of the Gulf Cooperation Council include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Trump officials this year pressured Malaysian authorities to crack down on semiconductor transshipment to China. The country is also in the crosshairs of a court case in Singapore, where three men have been charged with fraud for allegedly disguising the ultimate customer of AI servers that may contain high-end Nvidia chips barred from China. Malaysian officials are probing the issue. Li visited Indonesia before Malaysia. In his meeting with President Prabowo Subianto, Li called for more cooperation and cited rising protectionism.

Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing sharply higher as investors react to President Donald Trump's announced delay ofEuropean Union (EU)import tariffs.Nasdaqfutures are 1.6% higher after the tech-heavy index dropped by 2.5% last week.S&P 500futures andDow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are up 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Bitcoin(BTCUSD) is rising slightly to trade at around $109,500. The 10-year Treasury yield and gold futures are declining, while oil futures are little changed. President Donald Trumppushed back accelerated tariffson EU imports to July 9 on Sunday, two days after an announcement that they'd take effect June 1sent markets lowerahead of the holiday weekend. \"The Commission President said that talks will begin rapidly,\" Trump wrote in a message on the Truth Social platform, a reference to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \"Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,\" von der Leyen wrote in an X post. Tesla's\u00a0(TSLA)EU sales sankfor a fourth consecutive month in April. Data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association showed that Tesla's EU new car registrations, which serve as a proxy for sales, plunged 53% year-over-year to 5,475 vehicles in April and have dropped 46% over the first four months of 2025. The weak sales figures come even though\u00a0overall battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in the EU jumped 34% in April. Tesla shares are rising 2% in premarket trading amid the broader market rally on the EU tariff deadline extension. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares surged by nearly 9% in premarket trading after a report that the Truth Social parent looked to raise as much as $3 billion for cryptocurrency investments.The Financial Timesreported that Trump Media was seeking $2 billion in equity and $1 billion through convertible bonds to fund the cryptocurrency purchases. U.S. consumer confidence is expected to stay steady in May when that data is released at 10 a.m. ET. The report comes as consumer surveys over the past several months have shownelevated public worriesover the impact of tariffs, including higher inflation expectations.

        "header": "Buying Nvidia Stock Before May 28 Could Be Your Last Chance to Get This Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock on the Cheap",
        "content": "ThoughNvidia(NVDA-1.02%)stock has been under pressure so far in 2025 owing to several factors outside of the company's control, such as tariffs and concerns that spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware could slow down thanks to the arrival of cost-efficient models, recent stock price action suggests that the company is making a solid comeback. Shares of the chip designer have shot up by 28% in the past month. The good part is that Nvidia is still trading at an attractivevaluationeven after its recent surge. However, with the company set to release its fiscal 2026 first-quarter results after the market closes on May 28, it could become more expensive to buy for investors who are sitting on the sidelines. Let's see why that may be the case. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on April 27) calls for $43 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range. That would translate into a year-over-year increase of 65%. However, there is a good chance that Nvidia may be able to coast past that expectation thanks to the tremendous demand for its AIgraphics processing units (GPUs). There have been concerns that the demand for Nvidia's AI GPUs could wane because of the tariff-fueled turmoil, as well as apotential drop in AI spendingbecause of the emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective but competent reasoning model. Yet recent chatter indicates that the actual story might turn out to be different. For instance, Reuters reported last month that Chinese firms have placed orders for $16 billion worth of Nvidia's H20 GPUs in the first quarter of calendar 2025. The orders for this chip have reportedly surged following the increase in demand for cost-efficient AI models in the wake of DeepSeek's breakthrough. Chinese tech giants such asAlibaba,Tencent, and ByteDance are said to be stocking up on Nvidia's chips, anticipating a shortage in their supply because of export restrictions imposed on the chipmaker. Nvidia's revenue from China stood at $17 billion in all of fiscal 2025. So, the above estimate of $16 billion indicates that it may have done a year's worth of business with Chinese customers in just a quarter. Of course, you may be wondering if the previous U.S. administration's decision to ban sales of Nvidia's China-specific H20 processors is going to dent the company's outlook by costing billions of dollars in sales. However, the Trump administration plans to modify and pull back some of the previous regime's export curbs, and that could turn out to be a tailwind for Nvidia's Chinese business. At the same time, investors should note that Nvidia has reportedly modified its H20 AI chip to meet the restrictions and will release the updated version in July. Nvidia is said to have modified its chips in the past to ensure that it remains on the right side of the export restrictions that it faces from time to time, and that has allowed the company to remain a key player in the Chinese AI market. So, while Chinese-related business is likely to help Nvidia deliver stronger-than-expected results for the previous quarter, strong AI spending in the U.S. could give its outlook a big boost. A recent report from theFinancial Timessuggests thatOracleis set to buy $40 billion worth of Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips for deployment in OpenAI's data center in the U.S. This investment is reportedly outside of the $500 billion investment that OpenAI and its partners have pledged in U.S.-based AI infrastructure in the form of the Stargate Project. Nvidia's business isexpected to receive a nice boostfrom Stargate, and that's another reason why the company's guidance for the current quarter could exceed consensus expectations. Analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to increase by just 20% year over year in the current quarter. This can be attributed to the margin compression that the company is anticipatingduring the initial production rampof its Blackwell processors. However, stronger-than-expected growth in Nvidia's top line could allow it to mitigate the negative margin impact and deliver a bigger jump in earnings. Meanwhile, Nvidia management points out that its margin profile will return to the normal range later this year when Blackwell production is fully ramped up. So, Nvidia's earnings growth is likely to pick up momentum as the year progresses. Consensus estimates point toward something similar, expecting Nvidia's earnings to jump 46% year over year in fiscal Q2. That's why savvy investors should consider buying Nvidia before May 28, as it is trading at 30 timesforward earningsright now, which is well below its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 40. Even the tech-ladenNasdaq-100index has an average earnings multiple of 31. All this suggests that investors are getting a terrific deal on Nvidia stock right now, and they may not want to miss it since the stage seems set for a strong set of quarterly results and guidance from the company that could supercharge its recent rally.",

Nvidia's report will serve as a coda on what has so far been a stronger-than-expected earnings season for corporates, who remainhighly sensitive to tariff developmentsbut drove profit growth in the year's first three months at afaster rate than analysts had forecast.

Yahoo Finance'sLaura Brattonreports: Read more here. Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday will be the market's biggest event this week. And new datahighlighted by Bloomberg on Tuesdaysuggests there could be trillions of dollars ready for deployment once these results clear. Strategists at BBVA cited by Bloomberg see institutional investors as having exposure to US stocks that is \"far from exuberance levels,\" meaning the $7 trillion currently parked in money market funds could come flowing back into stocks depending on these earnings break. Throughout 2025, numerous headwinds have faced US stocks from an allocation standpoint, with the \"Sell America\" trade, tariff uncertainty, and rising interest rates offering all sorts of competition to US equities after two years in which Big Tech made US stocks the most important game in town for investors. The idea, we'd note, is not that this cash will pile into Nvidia stock itself \u2014 or even Big Tech, necessarily \u2014 but that enthusiasm for US stocks which has waned considerably in recent months could be restored if twin tailwinds of a more positive trade backdrop and a return to the buoyant AI story powered by Nvidia return in force this week.

        "content": "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to unveil its fiscal first-quarter 2026 results on Wednesday, May 28. Investors are watching closely after the company said it expects a$5.5 billion hitwhen the U.S. imposed export-license requirements on its H2O chips, widely seen as a de facto ban on China sales. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The stock's early-quarter slump reversed somewhat after the administration scrapped the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, but China still accounted for about 13 percent of NVIDIA's business as of May 27. Analysts remain cautious that fresh U.S. curbs or a tougher new regulatory framework could weigh on revenue. In its fourth-quarter report, NVIDIA had guided to roughly $43 billion in Q1 revenue, a 71 percent gross margin, and $0.93 in diluted EPS. If the full $5.5 billion charge flows through revenue, estimates drop to about $37.5 billion and $0.75 in EPS, closely matching consensus on revenue but falling short on profit. Looking ahead, NVIDIA is developing a Blackwell chip tailored for China, though homegrown rivals and lingering export hurdles may limit its impact. Meanwhile, a planned five-year, 18,000-GPU AI factory project in Saudi Arabia offers upside, yet any material revenue boost is likely still a ways off. Based on the one year price targets offered by 51 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $163.77 with a high estimate of $235.92 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +24.74% from the current price of $131.29. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

When you're ready to invest, check outthis top 10 list of stocks to buy. A full transcript is below. This podcast was recorded on May 17, 2025. Ricky Mulvey:I'm Ricky Mulvey, and that's Motley Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma. On today's show, Asit joins my colleague Mary Long to dive into the quantum realm. They discuss the questions and potential of quantum computing, what investors need to know about this technology and why Quantum's future may come sooner than you think. Mary Long:We talked a lot about and hear a lot about artificial intelligence these days, but there's another technology in far earlier stages of development that some think has the potential to make the hype around AI look like child's play. To others, it's the stuff of science fiction. That technology, the stuff in question, is quantum computing. Lucky for us, today we got a resident quantum industry, extraordinary Asit Sharma, who is kind enough to travel through time, space, and many other dimensions to join us and help to mystify this ever complex topic. Asit, thanks for being here. Asit Sharma:Hey, Mary, how are you doing? I just flew in from the quantum realm, and boy, are my arms tired? Mary Long:I'm so glad for you to tell us more about this quantum realm, explain what it's like for the folks back home. Let's maybe start there, Asit. We won't touch on the realm quite yet, because well, despite the fact that you just came from it, we don't fully know exactly what it looks like. For those unfamiliar with quantum, but only heard about it, what is the promise of this technology? What is the promise of quantum computing? Asit Sharma:Sure, Mary so. The promise of quantum computing, I think is extremely simple. It's to solve intensely complex, large scale problems with a lot of variables and dependencies that classical computers would struggle to solve. While it sounds like it's all powerful, quantum computing isn't going to be applied to simple problems to solve them faster, but think really difficult things like predicting the weather. This is just one I'm sure we're going to talk about some more. This is something that classical computers have a lot of trouble with because they solve things linearly one step at a time, and a quantum computer promises to be able to process in parallel. This is the essential premise and the promise of this technology. Mary Long:How then does the promise? If the promise is solving really, really complex problems fast, how is that different from the promise of really souped up artificial intelligence? Should we be thinking of quantum computing as a hyperextension of artificial intelligence, or is it doing something differently? Asit Sharma:Mary, that's such an insightful question because if AI is so powerful, why couldn't we just use AI to eventually get to these large scale problems? The answer is pretty interesting. Even though, like, artificial intelligence, generative AI has its mysteries, we don't know exactly how the black box works when we're talking about generative AI and large language models, neural networks, etc, that is still based on classical computing concepts. Everything running through a computer, including AI computation is based on this very discrete binary system of zeros and ones added together. Everything we do on a computer, a classical computer is based on something that's totally deterministic. I get a zero and a one. I can understand that, that makes sense to me. Quantum computing is a little different in that it takes a concept from quantum mechanics, which is a little strange to us, and it's one of the mysteries that underlines our physical existence. It's a mystery of the universe. But it's based on the idea that a single particle, no matter how small, exhibits both the properties of a particle and a wave at the same time. For those of you who are starting to remember your high school or college physics, yes, this is behind some of those principles like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. If you've heard of Schrodinger's cat, this principle is also associated with that. But if a particle can exist as one discrete thing, but also a wave function at the same time, it means that we can trap that particle and have it sit in a state of what's called superposition. A state of superposition means that that particle will encompass all the possibilities or probabilities of being a zero or a one or somewhere in between at the same time. Now, when we actually measure the state of that particle, that waveform or wave function collapses, and it's either a zero or one. Quantum computing is a way to look at something that could be any number of possibilities, and the idea of a quantum computer is to start to direct the way that wave function collapses in a way that's going to sort of show us the results we want that will be more probabilistically aligned with what we want to see and this leads to the ability to look at many, many, many, many possibilities at one time. Instead of going in through this linear computation, we're going through multiple paths at once, and that's why it's so powerful. Mary Long:What's an example of a problem that a quantum computer could theoretically solve, that a classical computer couldn't? Asit Sharma:When we think about the healthcare industry, we've often heard in the past couple of years how AI is very suited to solve problems of drug discovery and searching for certain molecules. I think that's very true. I think that the transformer model of generative AI is very suited to looking for patterns in sequential pieces of data. But you can only do so much with that. There's a problem in drug discovery, which is how a drug molecule will bind to a protein's active site. It seems simple, but proteins are really flexible. They're not rigid, so you have so many possibilities of how what's called a protein ligand can bind to that site because they keep moving. Also, here you've got interactions at micro scale going on within a protein. Classical computing can only do so much when you're trying to figure out this one problem. But a quantum computer could really scale up and look at all the possibilities, and in that sense, we can get a better understanding of this binding from molecule to protein, much, much more extreme computation than we could ever do with a classical computer. Mary Long:That's a helpful framework and illustration because I feel like often when we talk about quantum computing and its promise and what it could lead to, the answer so often lies in speed. Oh, it can solve these really complex problems really, really fast. I hear far less about the actual that might be very cool if you're a scientist or if you're a physicist and you live within this theoretical realm. But it can be difficult to connect that theoretical nuts and bolts piping to, like, actually what that means for consumers and everyday people that aren't using the technology, but are recipients of others using that technology. When you think about, like, practical goods that could come from quantum computing technology, what are those goods? Is it, Hey, better healthcare products, better healthcare technologies, or does the answer maybe extend beyond that industry as well? Asit Sharma:Sure, there are different industries that can benefit. One, surprisingly, is just, like, the delivery of goods, so let's stay on goods, products and stuff for a second. One of the hardest problems to solve is complicated logistics. If you'reAmazon.com,and you've got all these warehouses across the United States and thousands of trucks, millions of people to make deliveries to optimizing that network so that each driver can make the most efficient delivery and also have the most fuel efficient route is incredibly hard. Then when you scale that problem up to goods being shipped into the country and then taken to these warehouses, etc, that becomes exponentially harder as the problem scales. One of the uses that quantum computing may be very good at in the future is quickly solving some of this stuff, so we optimize routes and we optimize energy usage. There's a way we get a double win, the double win being you get your packages faster, Mary, and it's also more fuel efficient so we're doing less harm to the planet. That's just one example. In my world in investing, there's the idea of trying to understand risk across many, many companies or even within a single company. The most common expression that we have is the idea of portfolio optimization. If you've got a portfolio of 100 stocks, which I'm sorry to say I do. I'm not saying that I follow everyone to the Nth degree. I've got a handful that are most important to me, but I do have 100 or so companies that I own at least slices of being able to optimize the portfolio that I have for the best risk return proposition for myself is combinatorilly really difficult. A classical computer, again, just fails at doing a great job at this, but this is one of the things that quantum computing should be good at once we get to that desired state of this being very robust. Mary Long:I'm going to hone in on a word you just use should be very good at. So much of this conversation has been focused on what might happen in the future, should we unlock the full potential of this technology. But there are companies today that are already experimenting with and trying to develop this. What is the state of quantum computing today right now as we're talking? Asit Sharma:Right now, we have some fledgling quantum computers that have been built and are functional. They are mostly being used by research institutions, but we're starting to see Fortune 500 companies utilize these computers in very basic types of experimental computations, mostly through renting out on a model where you're getting some time on a company's quantum computer and running some quantum algorithms, some computations or even simulating a quantum algorithm. And we've got subsets of problems that are being solved. And this is because the quantum computers of today, while they show a lot of promise, they're subject to certain problems of the quantum realm. One of those is the problem of decoherence, so you have to have extremely stable states that are isolated from normal environments for quantum computing to work. It's very prone to error. A lot of energy is going into solving for the errors in quantum computations. Because remember, here, we're not really dealing as much with just math and binary computation. We're actually in these computers isolating particles and using the particles to solve the problems. We have to keep those in a state that remains in superposition, meaning that it's got that state of lots of probabilities if we're trapping one ion and asking it to perform computations. We don't want it to interact with the environment. That can make that function collapse more quickly, and we won't get the desired results. This is a long way of saying that right now things are still at an experimental state, but we have reached a stage where companies are solving some smaller real world problems. And we've got some bio pharmaceutical companies that are experimenting around with this. We've got some industrial companies that are doing so as well. Mary Long:Jensen Wong has predicted that a very useful quantum computer is about 15-30 years away, 15-30 is quite the range. You just outlined some of the problems that we have in scaling quantum computers. What needs to happen for a very useful quantum computer to become a reality? When we get that, is it just, Hey, rather than solving simple problems that today's quantum computers are solving, we can solve more complex problems, or is it, hey, we've answered all these questions about how do you avoid decoherence? We're using less energy to actually make these computers operate. Is the usefulness of these quantum computers that Jensen's predicting? Is it that they're more useful because they can solve more difficult problems or that they're more useful because we don't have to answer all these other questions that are tied into the realm now? Asit Sharma:There's a lot to unpack with what Jensen Wong said, Mary. We're going to start on the personal level. I had just spent many weeks in a deep dive in quantum computing, bothering some of my friends who have a scientific background, talking a lot to large language models, trying to dust off old, like math from years gone by in my head. I was so angry when he said that. I'm like, Dude, I just spent all this time. Are you telling me this is 30 years away? Come to find that Jensen walked that back. Considerably. He actually said atNvidia's GTC conference in March, they had a quantum day that when he talked to his senior engineers, they said, probabilistically, it's going to happen sooner. It could be less than 20 years. It could be less than 15 years, and he invited some of the CEOs of the small companies that have built quantum computers onto the stage to explain to the audience why he was wrong to say that. In fact, when Jensen Huang made his prediction, he confessed later he didn't realize that there were publicly traded companies that were building quantum computers. Part of this is a very brilliant guy who's thought a lot about the quantum realm and the physics of how we compute for a long time, just being too busy to surface and look at what the state of things where it stands today. But he's right in that the timescale is not going to be 2026. I personally think it'll be somewhere between 5-10 years from today to reach what he's talking about. What Jensen Huang and other people are pointing at are a few things. I think the most useful place we can reach is something called quantum advantage. That's when a quantum computer is going to be able to perform a task better, so more efficiently, more accurately than the best alternative we have that exists in a classical computer for a useful problem, for a practical problem, and they can do that with regularity. When that occurs, I think many people will say we've reached a point where we have an inflection or a tipping point, maybe like a ChatGPT moment. There's also something else people talk about which is quantum supremacy, and this is the point at which a quantum computer is going to perform computations that any classical computer couldn't solve in a very reasonable point in time. We have some theoretical examples already. There's a company called Rigetti Computing, which claims to have done so. We have IBM and Alphabet, which also have their versions of reaching quantum supremacy. But these aren't really large-scale examples or even easy-to-understand examples. They're in each case, very abstruse. What we need to happen, really, the thrust of your question is, it's cool. When we think about our computers, we've all heard about bits and bytes. The primary computational unit in quantum computing is called a qubit, and that often is where you are using one particle and you are performing operations on that particle to get that probabilistic result. This is how the problem gets solved. You're doing it at, again, a state which nature can't really interfere. You're freezing this to near absolute zero in this big cryogenic machine. We have to be able to have qubits scale up. Many qubits, which are already prone to errors to be able to have those solve problems and then communicate with each other through a process called entanglement. Entanglement itself is really crazy. This is a way that certain particles are connected to each other with information. No matter how far you separate them, one could be here where I am. Mary, one could be across the country where you're sitting as we're recording, and they are simultaneously exchanging information. This is a property of the particle realm. Einstein called this spooky action at a distance. Entanglement is cool, but we can use entanglement to do computation. We can influence through certain quantum algorithms. When we take one qubit and then add another and add another and then start scaling that system up and also solve for error correction, that's what needs to happen to reach these stages, what we call quantum advantage or quantum supremacy, where we'll hit that inflection point and suddenly we're going to see the meme stocks, and we're going to see a lot of, I'm going to call them quantum bros in advance, talking about where you should be investing. Mary Long:Let's talk about some of the companies that are already working on this technology where investors that are interested in this might look if they want to ride this wave. On one side, we'll start here, you've got what I'm going to call the big dogs, and there's probably nobody that's going to dispute that description. They're basically the big-pocketed names that listeners are already familiar with. You've gotIBM, Microsoft, and Google. These companies are building their own quantum computers from the ground up. They're also building out all the supporting technology that powers these systems. Asit, how different are the systems that these three companies are building? What distinguishes them from each other? Asit Sharma:I think Alphabet, parent of Google, so I'll just stick with Alphabet for now, has a pretty similar approach to IBM. Alphabet has what's called a superconducting qubit. Basically, it's a way that you can do quantum calculations in a manner that's similar or analogous to how semiconductors operate. You're taking a superconducting chip, basically and using circuit elements that are very small, decreasing that temperature to near zero, and then having operations performed on it. You've got minuscule electric circuits that are etched into silicon, and their latest chip is called Willow. Willow had some breakthroughs in reduction of error rates, and it was interesting because Alphabet was showing that it was exponentially decreasing errors as the system scaled up. There's a lot of promise there. They're also developing the software that goes along with this. They have their own version of the QPU, or the quantum processing unit. Basically a full stack under development at Alphabet, and IBM has something very similar. They have a processor called the Heron quantum processor. Not quite easy to make a very similar comparison to Willow. But essentially, it's a processor that is also running calculations with multiple qubits and reducing error rates. Both of these companies are chasing the superconducting processor-based solutions, and then we've got Microsoft, which is doing something that's pretty crazy. Microsoft got fascinated, or its engineers got fascinated with a type of approach, which is very theoretical. It's based on encoding information in the physical properties of the particles themselves rather than measuring those particles. To do this, Microsoft had to prove the existence of what had been a theoretical particle called the Moderna Fermion, in order to make this system work. They seem to have done so. They've been putting out papers for a few years now, and it does look like they've proven the existence of this particle. But in doing so, their approach is more fault-tolerant than the other approaches I've described because you're really looking at the way the particle is shaped. There's a really common analogy here that some scientists have used to explain it to folks like me who don't get the math and physics of it, which is you think of a braided knot. As that knot starts to free from whatever external force, the knot itself remains. The coded information is very stable, and so it's taking an approach which is based on design. In some ways, you can think of it that way. These are three different approaches. Again, the first two are pretty similar. The third is out of left field, and I admire Microsoft for its ambition and the investments of however 100 millions they made. Just to take a really theoretical approach because it could have ended up where they got to the very last experiment and came back to top brass and said, Oh, guess what? That particle, we really can't prove its existence, and this approach doesn't work. Hundreds of millions of dollars later, we're going back to the drawing boards. I really admire Microsoft's ambition in that sense. Mary Long:Yeah, to try to build out a full-stack quantum computer is no doubt a very expensive endeavor. We're going to talk a bit more about specialized builders in a bit, but apart from those three big dogs that you just walked us through, is anybody else currently working on building out a full-stack quantum computer right now? Asit Sharma:Sure, there's a company called IonQ, which I still would characterize them as proof of concept, and maybe they're not a complete full-stack, but they have a computer which uses a trapped ion approach. Trapping ions, it's a very stable way to do quantum computing calculations, and theirs is it lends itself to a full stack approach. But to get to where it has reached, it really had to work on both the hardware and software systems. We've got that. We've also got a company called Quantinuum which is pretty interesting. Quantinuum is actually a joint venture between a company, it's very small company out of the UK, which merged up in this joint venture with the giantHoneywell computing. Honeywell's joint venture, now commonly referred to as Quantinuum. Is also full-stack approach in that it also has really a host platform, as IBM does. I didn't mention IBM has an operational system and a software language called Qiskit, so it enables customers to come use IBM's quantum computing approach through a Cloud interface, and Quantinuum has that as well. Mary Long:I'm glad you mentioned Cloud interface because there's another way that big dogs are playing in this quantum space without having to tackle building out their own full-stack computer. Amazon is taking a totally different approach than the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and IBM. Rather than building out this full-stack computer, they're providing quantum computing access through its Cloud platform. It's like AWS, but for quantum. What's the advantage, Asit, of this approach over that which Google, Microsoft, and IBM are pursuing? Asit Sharma:The advantage is interesting because it's an advantage that Amazon has exploited with Amazon Web Services through many iterations. Just look at their AI platform. Mary, they are agnostic into what technology they offer. When Deep Seek comes along, they can offer that via AWS and their AI Cloud. They offer many large language models, but you're going to rent space from Amazon because they can give that inference to you at a pretty good cost. Braket is the Amazon Web Services of quantum computing, and they are helping the whole ecosystem by allowing smaller companies like a company called Querra, like IonQ, which I've just mentioned, host their quantum computers on Amazon site. You can go to Amazon Braket, which by the way, is named after a notation system in quantum mechanics created by a physicist, Paul Dirac. It's a fun name because it almost sounds like Braket, but Braket is a punny name for this. It's using its might and its Cloud platform to further the industry along. But if one of these smaller companies really takes off? Well, they're already on Amazon's platform, and that will help Amazon scale up its quantum business. That's the advantage. What disadvantage, I guess you're going to ask me next, is, shouldn't you be out there trying to make your own quantum computer? What happens if Microsoft and IBM and Alphabet come with these major breakthroughs? I was a skeptic about this, Mary, when I first started examining Amazon's approach, and I was like, this is great. They can have AWS for quantum computing, but maybe the bigger money is going to be for those that develop the actual quantum computer. But something interesting is happening along the way in that Amazon is hosting the actual cryogenic systems for some of these other companies. It's getting a first-hand view of what it takes to build these computers to operate them, and it's also developing some very interesting add-ons to its ecosystem. It's developed a quantum computing chip now in prototype phase called Ocelot, and that is aimed solely at reducing errors. It's trying to reduce quantum error corrections. When you can do this, then you automatically become a platform that companies developing their own systems want to work with. Because they have to sell that downstream to customers, and a more efficient system is a cheaper system. I think they're learning a lot about the entire quantum computer system, and it might not be too much of a lift for them in the future to jump back in. Mary Long:We've talked about these big pocketed companies that are experimenting and trying to build a foundation in the quantum space. But it's not just MAG seven companies that are doing this. There's also a lot of little players who operate in different niches of the quantum industry,IonQandRigetti Computing. Those are both companies that develop quantum systems that can work with and link up to the Cloud. You just walked us through Amazon's Brackett system. Obviously, Amazon has the name Amazon behind it, and with that, a larger scope. But is what Ion Q and Righetti, what those companies are doing different than Brackett, or are they all playing in the same space? Asit Sharma:Each has a different approach. There's a company calledD-Wave Quantum, which we haven't mentioned yet, but was just in the news in the past few months, one for apparently having a breakthrough in quantum computing, where it reached quantum supremacy, but also for selling a quantum computer to a German research institution. This is a company that has an approach called annealing, and that's basically working mostly in logistics type applications. You're focused on math type problems. D-Wave quantum has its approach this annealing, it fits right into Baquet. Ion Q, as I mentioned before, trapping ions, it goes right up into Amazon Baquete. For Rigetti computing, also, they have a more modular approach. Instead of trying to do this big full stack exercise or build only quantum computers, they want to build modules that can be used by customers. They are also on Baquet then there's another company that I have my eye on called Qa Computing. They're small, they're privately held. I think they're going to go public in a few years. Alphabet andSoftbankand some other investors just invested $230 million in Q. But Qa has its own approach, and it has a neutral atom quantum computer, again, available on Amazon web services. If you think about it, all these different approaches on the particle level, can be used. If you can just build a pipe to your customer, then the customer can make their own quantum algorithms and try to solve their own problems via Amazon web services. To answer your question, they're each a different type of system, but they're all building that pathway so that they're available for people who want to do simulations and run algorithms or design their own to use on these computers on this one platform. Mary Long:What about chipmakers and chip designers? How do they fit into this future quantum landscape or what foundations are they building today to one day fit into the quantum landscape? Asit Sharma:The chipmakers right now are mostly looking at how their applications will be able to accelerate the development of quantum computing and I know you've got a question or two on that. Let's talk about the chip designers for a second. Just a quick second. When we think of companies likeCadence Design SystemsandSynopsis, these are the businesses that help Nvidia orAMDdesign chips or Intel design chips. They have a part of their business which is focused on photonics. This is using light to transmit information, and as they become better at the physics simulations, they are becoming more important on the quantum landscape because this is the next step is looking at how you can transmit information from one quantum system to another. Quantum networking is what I'm referring to, and a lot of this is based on photonics. I think both of these two companies have a bright future in quantum computing, but so much as experimental now, you're looking at timelines that could be five or ten years. But I do think both have a way to play in this, especially Synopsis, which is acquiring a company called ANSIS. ANSIS specializes in these very types of physics simulations. The chip designers, the electronic design automation companies, I think, have a role to play. Right now, they're very busy laying out strategic roadmaps of how to become better integrated into this ecosystem as it grows. Mary Long:Zooming out and thinking about all that you've taught us today from an investing perspective, it seems to me that there's a parallel between investing in the quantum industry and investing in the biotech pharmaceutical industry. There's a lot of interesting work that's happening among the smaller players in the quantum industry and in the biotech space, but it's highly technical. As a layperson, it might be hard to distinguish between what one small upstart is doing and how that differs from another small upstart also, a lot of those small upstarts aren't profitable, so it's hard to actually make a good judgment about their financial situation and what that might look like should this largely theoretical product get off the ground in X amount of time. Instead, in the healthcare industry, rather than investing in biotech, if that feels a little bit too crazy to touch, what you can do is go to the big dogs. You can go to pharmaceutical companies. A lot of those pharmaceutical companies have very clear cut financials. They're steady companies, and oftentimes they have partnerships with the upstarts that are doing some of the more innovative work. Again, seems to be the same situation that you've laid out here. There's big names that are solid, steady companies that have partnerships and relationships with these smaller ones. The benefit in my mind, of applying this biotech approach to the quantum industry and investing in it, that feels obvious. But what are the downsides of going that way and only keeping an eye on the big dogs rather than taking on a bit more risk and looking at the more innovative but smaller players? Asit Sharma:The downside is that some of these smaller players may scale more quickly than would think at a first glance. I'll give you the example of IonQ I'm not saying, go out and purchase this company. I happen to own shares, but they're very decided on this idea of quantum networking. They actually acquired a quantum networking company. They want to be able to scale not just by building better fault-tolerant computers, but then to connect those even over wide distances. This is one of the things that's going to be very useful as we think about secure systems because quantum computing is going to open up a Pandora's box in all of our encryption standards are based on problems that are too hard for classical computers to solve, like the combinatorial problems of when you've got an encryption key that is very long. We never thought that anybody would be able to crack this, and that's why our whole cybersecurity industry has been built on concepts of mathematical encryption. Well, guess what? With a quantum computer, you ought to be able to crack that stuff pretty easily. Many of the companies we've mentioned, as they're discovering how to build their quantum computers. They're also already thinking about how they can thwart the day when it becomes really easy to crack the code, and you and I can never exchange any more snarky messages on signal. Not that we do, Mary, because you and I exchange snarky messages on Slack. We have no need to encrypt them, but you get my drift here. A company that's very small like Ion Q which is thinking of building these large quantum networks over distances in addition to its own computer, has potentially a solution for a secure network that a bank could use. There is some possibility that a few of these companies, just like the little biotechs that you alluded to, could blow up. Now, could there be binary outcomes where you put your money in and it's either boom or bust? Sure. But I think at least to be able to follow this space and understand what's going on in it and where the potential lies, it's not bad to at least follow a few of the names we've mentioned, even if you're not going to invest in them, the risk is that we have what turns out to be an Nvidia because you know, 27 years ago, Jensen Wong had an idea. Now, here he is saying 15-30 years in the future, this thing could be big. It's fun if you could identify a company and you're able to hold it for 20 years. That could be right now a small puppy growing into a big dog alongside the other companies. But I like your approach, and I think at the end of the day, it is important if you're interested in the industry to make sure you have some shares in one of the big dogs, as you call them, or even indirectly, as you said, if you like biopharmaceutical companies, I mean,Amgen,AstraZenecaare two companies I can think of that are actively trying to understand how quantum can assist their discovery, their drug discovery. It might not hurt to buy some shares in a few forward-looking companies that are embracing quantum across a few big-picture industries. Fidelity is another company that is also using quantum computing to think about the stuff I was talking about in finance before, like portfolio optimisation. Like a blend of this, companies that are embracing it, that will be customers of the big dogs, maybe one or two of the big dogs, and maybe a couple of the speculative ones whose ideas appeal to you, whose approach appeals to you. That's not a bad strategy as you're gaming this out, because it is at least five years away, and I'm one of the people I think who thinks it'll come a lot sooner than that 15-30 year initial time frame. Mary Long:Well, of course, you think it'll come sooner, Asit, because you are, after all, visiting us from the quantum realm itself. Appreciate you jumping through so many hoops and multiple dimensions to be with us and to educate the listeners of Motley Fool Money on all that is quantum. Thanks so much, Asit.

        "content": "Here are three of the biggest stories Wall Street is watching on Tuesday, May 27, 2025. Stock futures (ES=F,NQ=F,YM=F) are rising after US President Donald Trump decided to push back a 50% tariff on goods from the EU. Nvidia (NVDA) investors are eagerly awaiting the chip giant's first quarter results, which are set to be released Wednesday after the closing bell. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are rising despite sales in Europe declining by about 50% year over year in April. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere. Let's get to the three things that you need to know today. First up, US stock futures rising this morning as the US and the EU agreed to fast track trade talks. Last week, President Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the EU starting June 1st after complaining the block was slow walking negotiations and unfairly targeting US companies. But Trump extended the deadline back to July after a call over the weekend with EU Commission President Ursula van der Leyen. Plus Nvidia shares pushing higher today, ahead of its hotly anticipated earnings results that are due out after the closing bell Wednesday. The chip maker's report will show that it remains on track to top estimates for the year. Here, ultimately, Nvidia remains the leader in AI computing right now, but investors are going to be looking for updates from CEO Jensen Huang on the company's sales outlook, its competitive edge, and how it's navigating geopolitical tensions that could cut the company off from some major markets. Yahoo Finance will bring you full coverage of Nvidia's earnings results this week. You do not want to miss it. And Tesla's seeing its sales plunge in Europe, dropping 49% year of a year. Tesla's European sales have now fallen for a fourth straight month as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political views combined with the tepid reaction for the new Model Y and heightened competition weigh on the automaker.",

        "content": "The S&P 500 (SPX) surged Tuesday morning, putting the benchmark index on track to snap a four-day losing streak. The large-cap index rose as investors welcomedPresident Donald Trump\u2019s decision to delay tariffs on imports from Europethat he\u2019d announced just a few days earlier. The S&P 500 was up 1% at 5,860 in the opening minutes of Tuesday's session. The S&P 500 lost about a fifth of its value between mid-February and early April as investors assessed the impact oftariffson economic growth and inflation. However, the index has recovered 20% from last month\u2019s low amid growingoptimism about trade deals, the continued strength of the U.S. economy and generally strong corporate earnings. Below, we take a closer look at the S&P 500\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify price levels worth watching out for. Since hitting arecord highin mid-February, the S&P 500 trended sharply lower within a descendingbroadening formationbefore breaking out above the pattern late last month. More recently, the large cap index reclaimed the closely watched200-day moving average (MA), but retraced back toward the indicator last week, a move that coincided with therelative strength indexretreating from itsoverboughtthreshold. Let\u2019s identify crucialsupport and resistancelevels on the S&P 500\u2019s chart. Furtherdownsidefrom current levels could see the index initially test support around 5,700. This area may attract buying interest near the top range of a briefconsolidationperiod earlier this month that closely aligns with several troughs that formed on the chart in October and November last year. The bulls\u2019 inability to defend this crucialtechnicallevel could trigger a decline to 5,400. Those whoinvest in the indexmay look for entry points in this area near ahorizontal linethat links a series of correspondingprice actionon the chart stretching back to last July. A rally from the 200-day MA could propel a move toward the 6,100 level. The index may encounter overhead resistance in this location near severalpeaksthat developed on the chart from December to February just below thestock's all-time high (ATH). Investors can project a resistance level to watch above the S&P 500\u2019s ATH by using themeasuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart pattern to forecast future price moves. When applying the analysis to the index, we calculate the distance from the descending broadening formation\u2019s low to high and add that amount to the pattern'sbreakoutpoint. For instance, we add 1,200 to 5,450, which projects an upside target of 6,650, around 15% above Friday\u2019s close. It\u2019s worth noting this level also roughly sits in the same neighborhood as a bars pattern target that takes the index\u2019suptrendfrom late April to mid-May and overlays it from the low of last week\u2019spullback.

        "header": "Should You Invest In Crypto for Your Retirement? Experts Weigh In",
        "content": "After Bitcoin's recent record-breaking highs, many investors may be consideringcryptocurrenciesin their retirement portfolios. But should you invest in crypto for your retirement? Well, that depends. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments, but sometimes, with great risk comes great reward\u2014for the right buyers. Cryptocurrency, the umbrella term for digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, has existed as a concept since the 1990s.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency to hit the market, didn't emerge until almost 30 years later, in 2009.Mainstream cryptocurrency gained steam during the pandemic amid rising concerns about inflation. By January 2025, Bitcoin's price hit an all-time high of $109,026.02. However, market volatility just a few months later led to both steep declines and sharp rises in value. Employer-sponsored retirement planslike 401(k)s currently offer limited options for cryptocurrency investments due, in part, to the U.S. Department of Labor's 2022 guidance cautioning about the volatility of digital assets and the fiduciary responsibilities of investment advisors.However, the reintroduction of the Financial Freedom Act on April 1, 2025, aims to expand cryptocurrency offerings in these plans in the future. While most employer-sponsored plans still limit investments to traditional assets like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, andETFs, self-directed IRAs allow investors to expand their investment portfolios.Self-directed IRAsallow investors to access investments like cryptocurrency, real estate, precious metals, and private equity for retirement savings. Unlike traditional investments, which derive value from things like dividends and earnings, cryptocurrencies get their value from more abstract factors like scarcity, utility, adoption, security, and, above all, market sentiment. Speculation also plays a big part in cryptocurrency valuation, making these investments highly volatile. Cryptocurrency investing is tricky. Part of what makes cryptocurrency so popular is that it disrupts the market by challenging traditional financial systems and decentralizing control. However, that market disruption also makes cryptocurrency an even riskier investment for investors who are only well-versed in the status quo. \"The first and the biggest risk, in my opinion, is the lack of knowledge about what people are buying,\" saidTyrone V. Ross, Jr., president and founder of 401Financial. \"Many don't realize they're putting an asset that trades 24/7 into their portfolio without fully understanding where and how it trades. The normal concern advisors highlight is volatility, but the deeper issue is that people aren't following these assets closely enough with the right research.\" Additionally, the cryptocurrency regulatory landscape is still evolving. In the US, no one governing body is responsible for overseeing crypto, and there are ongoing negotiations about how much crypto regulation is needed. While any significant regulatory developments could up-end the cryptocurrency market, many advisors are encouraged about the future of crypto. \"One of the most often cited risks to investing in digital assets\u2014regulatory risk\u2014has been dramatically reduced [with the Trump administration\u2019s favorable stance towards crypto],\" saidElaine Asher, co-founder of Eve Wealth. \"With more institutions entering the space, the long-term outlook for crypto investing is evolving positively.\" Not all crypto assets are created equal. Some assets, like Bitcoin, will have more stability than others. Despite the associated risks of cryptocurrency, some financial experts argue that crypto has potential benefits for investors whose risk tolerance, timeline, and goals support it. Diversificationis a foundational investment strategy that crypto can help support. \"Cryptocurrency price movements don't always correlate closely with traditional markets and crypto can offer diversification benefits,\" said Asher. It may seem counterintuitive to mitigate risk in a portfolio by adding a highly volatile investment. Still, cryptos' low correlation to the stock market makes it a viable diversification option. Another potential benefit of cryptocurrency in aretirement portfoliois the opportunity for substantial returns. Cryptocurrency may lack the extensive historical record of traditional investments, but \"if you look back at the 16 years that Bitcoin has existed, it has outperformed any other asset over that timeframe,\" said Ross. Past performance does not guarantee future results, but a generally accepted investing principle is thatthe greater the risk, the greater the reward. Those investors willing to take the risk can hopefully see big returns in exchange, making it an excellent addition to their retirement portfolio. Experts generally recommend limiting cryptocurrency exposure in retirement accounts to between 1% and 5% of total retirement savings, but these allocations greatly depend on the investor's risk tolerance, timelines, and goals. Allocating a modest amount to cryptocurrency allows investors to benefit from the potential portfolio growth while minimizing the risk of completely losing their Bermuda-length retirement shorts if crypto performs poorly. \"Studies have shown that a small percentage allocation todigital assetsin a traditional 60/40 portfolio (60% equities, 40% bonds) over multiple years enhanced returns without dramatically increasing volatility,\" said Asher. Your timeline is another key consideration for determining cryptocurrency\u2019s place in a retirement portfolio.Bitcoin's historic returnsappear a lot like a yo-yo if someone were walking upstairs. There are plenty of ups and downs, but the prices generally move upward over time. Crypto exploded between September 2020 and March 2021.However, crypto is still not a get-rich-quick scheme and certainly not suitable for investors with a tight timeline until they need the money. Ross said that he \"tells people not to invest in crypto unless they have at least a five-year timeframe.\" As you near retirement, yourrisk toleranceshould typically decrease to a strategy more aligned with preserving your assets. This shift is necessary because you and your portfolio have less time to recover from potential losses. \"If you're 55 and thinking about using crypto to accelerate your savings, you may need to go back and look at the big picture,\" warned Ross. \"This isn't the time to be YOLO-ing into risky investments to play catch-up. A better approach is to see how Bitcoin or other digital assets fit into your overall portfolio strategy.\" Even with a modest allocation of 1% to 5% of cryptocurrencies, near-retirement investors should proceed cautiously. Ross said that retirees with 10 years to retirement or more can \"maybe add a little octane to their portfolio with some cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.\" However, he cautioned that no matter how many years you have until retirement, \"You need to see how it fits into your portfolio with everything else you own, but I don't think people always go through that rigor before hitting the buy button.\" Near-retirees with cryptocurrency assets must pay special attention to key risk mitigation strategies, like period rebalancing, to ensure the portfolio assets align with your risk tolerance as their values ebb and flow over time. Even as retirement approaches, experts like Asher recommend \"dollar-cost averaging (DCA), i.e., investing small amounts consistently over time, rather than trying to time the market.\" Finally, Asher said crypto investors, particularly those with a shorter timeline, should \"stay informed by following reputable sources and continue to educate yourself, especially as the space evolves. \" You defer taxes on cryptocurrency held in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s until you withdraw it in retirement. When you make withdrawals in retirement, they are subject to your regular income tax rate. Cryptocurrency investments do not have the same historical trend data as traditional assets, but from the data we do have, they have the potential for high long-term growth. With that long-term growth potential comes substantial risk, making it a higher-risk option for retirement planning than more traditional assets. Currently, the Department of Labor strongly discourages holding cryptocurrency in retirement accounts.However, Congress reintroduced legislation on April 1, 2025, to make cryptocurrency more widely available for retirement savings.Investors wanting to invest in cryptocurrency for retirement may use a self-directed IRA to accomplish their goals. Investors can protect their crypto assets by using accounts that offer assets securely stored with private keys or digital asset custodianship with a registered, qualified custodian. As crypto becomes better understood and more mainstream, along with developing regulation, more retirement plans may begin offering cryptocurrency options. Cryptocurrency investing, particularly for retirement savings, is a double-edged sword that can greatly impact your future plans. Whether you're a crypto novice or an old pro, you should always consider your risk, timeline, and goals before investing. \"Definitely consult with someone with a deep understanding of crypto assets or market research,\" Tyrone advised. \"You have to know where to get the right information and data. Most people don't, and that's why a lot of people end up getting hurt.\" With careful consideration, planning, and proper asset allocation, crypto can be a powerful accelerant of retirement savings. Asher concluded, \"Ultimately, crypto shouldn't feel like a gamble\u2014it should be a thoughtful, intentional part of a broader strategy.\"",

        "header": "One Bright Spot If a Recession Hits? It Might Be Mortgage Rates",
        "content": "When recessions hit, the financial picture can seem grim, but there might be a silver lining:Mortgage ratestend to fall. This happens because a slower economy pushes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing and investment. While you may expect a similar trend if the U.S. faces a recession in the near term (although a rate decline is not guaranteed), mortgage rates may not go as low as they have in recent years. When the economy is weaker,loandemand usually goes down as people, being uncertain about the future, tend to borrow less, said Aaron Gordon, senior mortgage loan officer at Guild Mortgage. Because of this, the Federal Reserve intervenes bylowering interest ratesto stimulate the economy. Historically, mortgage rates have fallen during or immediately after recessions. For example, during the Great Recession of 2008, 30-year fixed mortgage rates dropped from over 6% to below 5%. More recently, during the COVID-induced recession of 2020, mortgage rates fell to record lows, dipping below 3%. This is also tied to U.S. Treasury bonds. \u201cWhen recession fears rise, investors pull money out of the stock market and move it into safer assets like Treasury bonds,\u201d said Nicole Rueth, founder of The Rueth Team Mortgage and market trends committee member with Denver Metro Association of Realtors. \u201cThat demand drives down bond yields, and since mortgage rates closely follow the 10-year Treasury, those rates tend to drop alongside the yields.\u201d For existing homeowners, a recession can be an ideal time to refinance, especially if they holdmortgageswith higher rates. Refinancing essentially means replacing your existing mortgage with a new one, such as one with a lower interest rate, which can be easier to do during a recession when interest rates tend to be lower. Lenders might become more cautious and make loan applications stricter during a recession. Whileinterest ratestypically drop during recessions, this may not always be the case. Even when interest rates decline, not every recession guarantees a dramatic drop. Factors like higher inflation and other economic challenges can influence how much the rates fall, if at all. \u201cThe lowest rates in history were spawned by two of the biggest economic calamities that are not likely to happen this time, so I wouldn't expect mortgage rates in the 2s, 3s, or 4s,\u201d Gordon said. Consider keeping an eye on howhome priceschange. Recessions can cool the housing market, leading to slower appreciation or even falling home values. This could limit equity and refinancing options. In extreme cases, if home values drop significantly, some borrowers may find themselves underwater, owing more than their home is worth. Mortgage rates typically fall during the recession, which can open up opportunities for homebuyers to buy and for homeowners to lock in lower interest rates. However, it\u2019s important to consider other factors, like the condition of the housing market and broader economic challenges, during an unstable economic environment. Exercise caution and, ideally, speak to a financial advisor to find options that best suit your needs.",

        "content": "Shares ofNavitas Semiconductor(NVTS46.37%)skyrocketed as much as 70.7% on Tuesday, before settling down to a 40.9% gain as of 1:22 p.m. ET. The massive gain comes on the heels of last Wednesday's near-200% gain after hours, after the company announced a potentially game-changing deal withNvidia(NVDA3.07%). Today, Navitas announced it would be following up that bit of good news with an equity sale, which aims to raise $50 million at much higher prices. While an equity raise would normally send a stock down, the stock is actually increasing again today. Coming into last week's announcement, Navitas seemed like a speculativesmall-cap company. Last quarter's revenue was just $14 million, a decline from the prior-year quarter, with operating losses of $25.3 million. With small volumes of declining revenue,short interestin the company had crept up to 12.8% of shares outstanding and 18.4% of the float as of April 30. However, things may have changed last Wednesday, when Navitas issued a press release announcing its gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) chips had been selected to go into Nvidia's upcoming 800V DC architecture, which will be used in Nvidia's upcoming Rubin Ultra-based data center chip systems. GaN and SiC-based chips have been somewhat of a niche product in the chip industry to date, and only cost-effective for the most trying environments where higher voltages under higher temperatures are required, such as electric vehicles and infrastructure. And while EVs have been in a prolonged slump, artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are becoming increasingly power-hungry, to the point where using more SiC and GaN chips may now be required. The announcement likely produced a massive short squeeze last week. However, today, Navitas announced a new at-the-market (ATM) offering, whereby the company can sell shares in the open market to raise cash. In the press release, the company announced it had sold all the prior $50 million ATM authorization, and had signed up for a new ATM program of similar size. Image source: Getty Images. Normally, when a company announces it hasdilutedshareholders and may continue to do so, the stock goes down; however, it appears investors actually cheered this announcement. Likely, the company sold a lot of stock last week after the big surge, so investors may believe it raised that cash at attractive prices. Of note, the company only had $75 million in cash as of the end of last quarter, so raising more cash at attractive prices to extend Navitas' runway was met with applause. Navitas is hard to value right now, as it's unclear as to the impact of the Nvidia contract. While last week's announcement was certainly great news, I'd be wary of chasing any stock merely on the mention of a partnership with or investment from Nvidia. These moves are driven by hype-by-association, with unclear tangible effects.",

Nvidia is reportedly planning to launch a new AI chip for China at a lower price than the H20 model as it looks to navigate US export curbs. This comes after the Trump administration restricted the shipment of Nvidia's H20 chips to China without a license, that happened in April, leading to an expected $5.5 billion quarterly charge from the company. Company's market share for AI chips in China has plummeted from 95% before export restrictions took effect to, in 2022, to 50% currently. That's of the AI chip market specifically, and that's according to CEO Jensen Huang. Still, China does remain a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for an estimated 13% of its sales in its fiscal year 2025.

Meanwhile, as far as NVDA's first-quarter results are concerned, Bryson expects the company's positive catalysts to \"offset\" the difficulties that it started facing in China towards the end of Q1. Bryson covers the Enterprise Hardware sector for Wedbush. The Street's Perceptions of NVDA and Its Q1 Results Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) has improved the performance of its new Blackwell chips, while the tech giant has made major deals with a number of governments, Bryson noted. In light of these developments, the Street's fears about NVDA have become less intense, he stated. \"There are (fewer) concerns about Nvidia than there was two or three weeks ago because (it has) all of these other new revenue sources popping up,\" he said. Meanwhile, NVDA's strong revenue from China in the first two months of the year, along with the increased output of its Blackwell chips as Q1 progressed, should offset the weakness in China that the firm experienced in March, according to Bryson. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The new Blackwell-architecture GPU will be priced between $6,500 and $8,000significantly cheaper than the recently banned H20 model, which sold for $10,000 to $12,000. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The upcoming chip will use conventional GDDR7 memory and omit advanced packaging from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., allowing it to comply with tightened U.S. export restrictions that limit GPU memory bandwidth. The updated design aims to deliver around 1.7 terabytes per second of bandwidth, just under the regulatory cap. China accounted for 13% of Nvidia's revenue last fiscal year, but its local market share has dropped from 95% in 2022 to roughly 50% after U.S. sanctions. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said further restrictions could drive more customers to Chinese rivals like Huawei, which produces the Ascend 910B chip. Despite reduced performance compared to the H20, Nvidia's software stack and CUDA platform may help preserve its edge.

        "content": "Greg Abel is in a tough position. He\u2019s about to replace the most famous investor in the world as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A.,BRK.B) at a time wheneconomic uncertaintyis the big story, value investing isn\u2019t as popular, and some shareholders are questioning why the company ishoarding record amounts of cash\u2014almost $350 billion. Warren Buffett has said that Berkshire will be better under Abel's management and has said Abel understands businesses \"extremely well.\"So what can we expect from Abel next? What has he said is \"absolutely critical\" for Berkshire's future? At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire Hathaway had about $348 billion incash reserves.\u00a0For some investors, that's not a mark of success, but of missed opportunities. Buffetthas defended the company's cash pile. \"We have made a lot of money by not wanting to be fully invested at all times,\" he said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May.He has noted that sometimes, investment prospects are lacking. \"Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,\" he wrote in his 2025 shareholder letter. People tend to listen to him, but Abel might not be granted the same patience. That pressure, however, isn\u2019t expected to force Berkshire's next CEO to shift corporate strategy. Abel has said that the approach that worked for the past 60 years\u2014buying well-run, cash-generative companies with good long-term prospects at reasonable prices\u2014will continue. Buffett often described Berkshire\u2019sbig stash of cashas a safety net rather than a sign of failure. Abel shares that philosophy. He said in May that access to lots of cash is \u201can enormous asset to have,\u201d adding that it allows Berkshire to \u201cweather the difficult times and not be dependent on anybody.\u201d Berkshire has so much to spend because it\u2019s beenselling ample holdings\u2014more than $100 billion in stock in 2024 alone\u2014and paring backshare repurchases. Another reason is the nature of the businesses Berkshire owns. Abel, who joined Berkshire in 2000, has said the company will continue to target and nurture companies generating lots of cash. \u201cWe have a great set of operating companies that do produce significant cash flows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe intend to continue to ensure that\u2019s a strength of Berkshire as we go forward. It\u2019s absolutely critical to our long-term success.\u201d Berkshire investors generally can\u2019t complain about how the company has been run. However, some might hope the new boss won\u2019t be so hesitant to spend cash. Abel said that before pulling the trigger, \u201cthe value relative to the risks has to be right.\"A key factor is determining the economic prospects of target companies five, 10, and 20 years from now and seeing if that\u2019s reflected in the share price. If the valuation is too lofty or the company\u2019s future is unclear, Abel said Berkshire won\u2019t invest. \"It's really theinvestment philosophyof how Warren and the team have allocated capital for the last 60 years,\" he said. \"It will not change, and it's the approach we'll take as we go forward.\" Berkshire Hathaway's corporate strategy isn\u2019t expected to change when Abel takes over as CEO. If a company doesn\u2019t produce significant cash flows, trade at a reasonable price, or have clear long-term economic prospects, Abel says he won\u2019t buy it, regardless of how much excess cash Berkshire is sitting on.",

Okta (OKTA), Macy\u2019s (M), and Costco (COST) are also set to report this week. Stocks closed in a sea of green on Tuesday, led by tech, as positive economic data and trade developments fueled investor sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day up about 1.8%, or over 700 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed roughly 2.1% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the averages to the upside, rising around 2.5%. It's pretty commonplace to see any chart that has to do with Nvidia's (NVDA) business over the past several years looking like a hockey stick. From a more than 700% growth in the company's market and share price since the launch of ChatGPT in late November 2022,the charts are eye-catching. But in our Chart of the Day today, we wanted to highlight how the growth of Nvidia's actual products is just as astonishing. The AI chip leader uses a metric called \"AI FLOPS\" which stands for floating-point calculations per second. The company provided Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton with a breakdown of how many FLOPs each of its GPUs over the past several years has been able to hit. Hopper, first launched in 2022, maxed out at 2,958 FLOPs. Nvidia's new Blackwell chip hits about 20,000 FLOPs. You don't have to understand the granular parts of AI computing, or even what a FLOP is, to see this chart and comprehend why Nvidia is winning the AI race by a landslide right now. The productivity of the product they're selling to end users has skyrocketed just like their stock price. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock jumped around 6% in afternoon trading on Tuesday after Elon Musk announced he'll be spending more time at the EV maker and his other businesses. The stock, which was a top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance, also gained momentum following President Trump'sdelay of a 50% tariff on the European Union, easing fears of a trade conflict. Together, these updates drove Tesla\u2019s shares to the upside and supported overall positive sentiment in the market. \"Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,\u201d Musk said in part following an X outage. He added he \"must be super focused on \ud835\udd4f/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.\" The news comes as Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell a whopping 49% in April compared to a year ago, to 14,228. Meanwhile, overall EV registrations in the region (which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association) rose 34.1% in April, with overall registrations down 0.3%. Read more here. Consumer confidence surprisinglyrebounded in Mayas respondents digested the tariff pause between the US and China. But in a special question from The Conference Boardin this month's survey,consumers did express some changes to their spending habits in the past several weeks. Consumers indicated they're saving for future expenses, dipping more into their savings right now than before and postponing some major purchases. These reactions weren't enough to weigh on the overall impact index, but whether or not these responses actually lead to slower consumer spending will remain key to the economic narrative as investors wait to see if heightened tariffs eventually weigh on economic activity. Wall Street is keeping a close eye on the bond market after long-term Treasury yields spiked last week as investors reassessed the US fiscal outlook in light ofPresident Trump's proposed tax legislation. The 30-year Treasury yield (^TYX) surged as high as 5.15% last week, hovering near its highest level since 2007. Yields pulled back slightly in early Tuesday trading, with the 30-year yield dipping back below 5% following reports that Japan's central bank may scale back its own bond issuance. Still, investor anxiety remains elevated. While ballooning deficitshave long been a concern, the current wave of unease reflects a collision of both new and familiar threats, with fiscal fears, stubborn inflation, and political uncertainty top of mind. At the center of it all isTrump's newly advanced tax bill, which cleared the House last week and is now headed to the Senate. \"We're concerned about the 10-year and the 30-year in particular as it pertains to the fiscal position, and that makes it much more difficult to forecast,\" Eric Winograd, chief economist at AllianceBernstein, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. Historically, Treasury yields have followed the business cycle and expectations for Fed policy. But with the \"big beautiful bill\" projected to add$4 trillionto the national debt over the next decade, fiscal risk has become a key driver of long-term rates. The legislation proposes sweeping cuts to individual and corporate tax rates but lacks swift and substantial spending cuts, deepening investor concerns over the US'salready fragile fiscal situation. \"There's no evidence of fiscal restraint,\" Winograd said. \"If anything, we're seeing additional fiscal deterioration. As a result, we expect the yield curve to steepen, and that longer-dated yields [will] remain sticky.\" Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) is doubling down on cryptocurrency, unveiling plans Tuesday to create what it claims will be one of the largest bitcoin treasuries held by any public company. The initiative is backed by a $2.5 billion private funding round, with commitments from roughly 50 institutional investors,according to a company press release. The deal includes $1.5 billion in Trump Media common stock and $1 billion in convertible senior secured notes, set to close on or around May 29. Once finalized, the move will place bitcoin directly on Trump Media\u2019s balance sheet, alongside existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $759 million as of the end of Q1 2025. Shares of Trump Media, which are majority owned by President Trump, fell over 7% in early trading following the announcement. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), meanwhile, ishovering near record highs,trading around $110,000 per coin. Trump Media, the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, streaming service Truth+, and fintech brand Truth.Fi, said the bitcoin play is part of a broader strategy to integrate digital assets across its media and financial ecosystem.

Thelatest index readingfrom the Conference Board was 98 in May, well above the 85.7 seen in April and the 87.1 economists had expected. The expectations index surged off its 13-year low seen in April, reaching 72.8 in May, far above the 55.4 seen the month prior. The cutoff date for preliminary results was May 19, meaning any opinions swayed by the US-China tariff delay were likely factored in, but the latest tariff back and forth with the European Union and Apple (AAPL) wouldn't have been accounted for. \"The rebound was already visible before the May 12 US-China trade deal but gained momentum afterwards,\" Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist of global Indicators at the Conference Board, wrote in the release. \"The monthly improvement was largely driven by consumer expectations as all three components of the Expectations Index \u2014 business conditions, employment prospects, and future income \u2014rose from their April lows. Consumers were less pessimistic about business conditions and job availability over the next six months and regained optimism about future income prospects.\" US stocks jumped higher to kick off the shortened holiday trading week, eyeing a comeback fromFriday's losseson the heelsof brighter prospectsfor an EU-US trade deal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped about 1%, or over 400 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) shot up 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the averages to the upside, rising around 1.6%. The major stock indexes broadly rose on Tuesday ahead of the opening bell, and with them, individual movers trending on the Yahoo Finance platform: Nvidia (NVDA)stock gained 2.5% as the AI chip giant'searnings come into focus. Nvidia will report Q1 earnings after the bell on Wednesday, offering a crucial report for AI investors. Tesla (TSLA)sales declined in Europe, as my colleague Karen Friar detailed below. But the stock was up 2.3% in premarket trading amid a broad rally on accelerated EU-US trade talks. Palantir (PLTR)stock added 3% as part of the broader rally on Tuesday. Optimism over artificial intelligence and Palantir's positioning for government contracts has lifted shares more than 63% year to date. PDD Holdings (PDD)stock tumbled more than 17% after the Temu parent companymissed earnings expectations. First quarter profits at the Chinese e-commerce firm fell 47% as PDD battled intensifying competition and tariffs. Check out additional trending tickers on Yahoo Finance. The spotlight on Nvidia (NVDA) is intensifying in the countdown to the AI bellwether's quarterly results after the close on Wednesday.

Tesla's (TSLA) sales in Europe fell 49% in April, even as sales of battery EVs overall jumped in the region, Reuters reports. That marks the fourth straight month of sales declines for Tesla, amid protests over CEO Elon Musk's political activities. A lackluster reception for the revamped Model Y and fierce competition from European and Chinese rivals also played a part. Tesla's market share in Europe fell last month to just 0.7%, comparee with 1.3% a year ago, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) showed. Despite the news, Tesla's shares rose in premarket, up over 2% as US stocks more broadly made gains.

Asia-Pacific markets mostly declined Tuesday as investors digested the implications of US President Donald Trump's decision to defer 50% tariffs on European Union imports, sparking fresh concerns about the global trade outlook. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 (^N225) slipped 0.2% to 37,451.60, while the broader Topix index was flat. The decline followed comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, who signaled that interest rate hikes could be on the horizon due to rising inflation. Mainland China\u2019s CSI 300 (83188.HK) dipped 0.6% despite data showing industrial profits rose 1.4% in April, up from 0.8% in March. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index (^HSI) fell 0.2%. South Korea's Kospi (^KS11) dropped 0.6%, pulling back from a recent three-month high. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 (^AXJO) rose 0.3%.

Moreover, the bank continues to identify the tech giant as \"a top pick.\" Potentially \"Messy\" Guidance The chip maker's Q2 revenue guidance could be \"as low as $41 billion,\" well below analysts' average outlook of about $46 billion, according to the bank. Further, its Q2 earnings per share outlook may come in at 85 cents, which is about 16% below the mean estimate, the bank warned.

        "content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK (Reuters) -Traders in the options markets are bracing for industry-wide volatility when AI-chipmaker Nvidia reports results on Wednesday, with defensive options contracts on a major semiconductor ETF drawing heavy trading. For VanEck Semiconductor ETF, the largest semiconductors ETF with some $22 billion in assets, about 2.4 put options changed hands daily over the last 10 days against every call option traded, the most defensive the trading has been in about 10 months, according to Trade Alert data. Call options convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future while put contracts offer the right to sell the shares at a given price. \"The put buying in SMH ahead of Nvidia's earnings reflects growing concern about potential volatility for the entire sector following the report,\" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. On Tuesday, some 105,000 put options changed hands against about 16,000 call options, by 3 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), Trade Alert data showed. In one notable trade, one investor last week bought 50,000 put options in SMH that would guard against the ETF's shares slipping about 10%, to below $220, by the end of May. Nvidia accounts for about a fifth of the semi ETF's assets but due to its dominance in theartificial intelligencemarket, the chipmaker's influence goes beyond its weight in the fund, analysts said. While investors have been focused on defensive plays in the SMH ETF, options action on Nvidia itself was more mixed, Murphy said. Murphy said investors were selling options to take advantage of heightened volatility expectations around the chipmaker's earnings, meaning they were betting the reaction to the chipmaker's results will not be overly severe. \"It's been hedging in SMH while in NVDA they\u2019re tactically monetizing elevated premiums ahead of earnings,\" he said. Susquehanna makes markets in the securities of Nvidia. Interactive Brokers\u2019 list of the 25 most active securities by client orders showed Nvidia ranked second, underlining the heightened investor interest in the results. Still, the stock was only one of two names for which investors were net sellers. \"That likely reflects some caution ahead of earnings after a solid run,\" Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers\u2019 chief strategist, said in a note. Nvidia will be the last of the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap tech and growth companies to report results for this period. Their stocks have been mixed in 2025 after leading the market higher as a group in the last two years. For the year, Nvidia shares are up about 0.7%, while SMH shares are up about 1.2%.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is gearing up to report earnings on Wednesday with big expectations around data center growth and the fallout from US chip restrictions on China. Yahoo Finance Technology EditorDan Howleyjoins Market Domination to break down the key numbers to watch and what Nvidia's strategy in China could mean for the stock. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Let's welcome in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan, what are we watching? Yeah, Josh, I mean, let's just go over the the the numbers that we're expecting real quick. First, uh, we're expecting to see earnings per share of 88 cents on revenue of 43.4 billion dollars. That would be up from 61 cents and revenue of 26 billion in the same period last year. Uh, we're also here, uh, looking for data center revenue of 39.2 billion dollars. That would be up from the 22.5 billion. Uh, and then gaming revenue, gaming, was originally a gaming company, uh, still its second largest segment, but way smaller than the data center. Uh, that's expected to come in at 2.8 billion up from 2.6 billion. Uh, all of those numbers are important. I think that the the big one, obviously the big one is data center, but the other one that people are going to be looking at is China revenue and what that looks like, uh, after the the Trump administration banned the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips, uh, there. Uh, the the company announced that they are taking that 5.5 billion dollar charge. The revenue for the region for the quarter was expected to come in at 6.2 billion. Uh, that would have been a 150% increase, uh, from the 2.4 billion they had previously seen. Um, and I I just want to go over, uh, something that we had seen, uh, this morning from, uh, Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley, uh, basically saying that, look, this is something, uh, that there's no way to offset that kind of loss, like there's no other place for for Nvidia to really kind of come back from that for for this quarter specifically because they can't sell Blackwell chips into China at all. Uh, these chips, the H20s, were originally built as a way for them to continue to sell devices into China after the Biden administration had said you can't sell your your highest end chips. Uh, back then it was the Hopper chip. So the H20 is based on, uh, the Hopper technology. Now those are banned. This all kind of comes as a result of the growing fears of of, uh, China, uh, and its AI capabilities. DeepC didn't really help with that, uh, because it the company proved that they could put out high-end models without using top of the line chips like, uh, Hopper or, uh, Blackwell itself. So, the the Trump administration, uh, kind of said, look, we're just going to put the kibosh on that. Even though there was some inkling that they may have gotten the ability to continue to sell them. Uh, Jensen Wong has been going back and forth to, uh, to meet with Trump. But obviously, that's going to be, I think, the the main thing that people look for is is what's happening with China, what what their plans, uh, going forward? There's been reports from Reuters that they're working on, uh, a modified version of the H20 to like a China compliant exactly what they did with the the H20 to begin with, right? Making a chip specifically for the Chinese market. You know, Huawei is is gaining steam there, right? Uh, Jensen Wong's, uh, argument is if Nvidia's not sold in China, then you're creating this kind of separate ecosystem, right? We've talked about the the two webs, right? The the internet in China, then the internet in the rest of the world. Well, there's the idea then of the kind of two graphics card or or AI accelerator, uh, chip markets. One would be China, one would be, uh, Nvidia and and and its competitors in the rest of the world. And so what does that mean? Do you want then China to be reliant on a US technology? Jensen Wong says that's the ideal, uh, but obviously the the administration's saying we just don't want them to have chips, period. So, I mean, it's it's going to be very interesting. Um, usually after these reports the stock kind of wavers a little bit because, you know, I think for the past few quarters people have been like, no, where's that 400%? What's 100%? That's nothing. Where's that 400% growth? So I think I think we we might also continue to see that as well. China compliant. Exactly, yeah. Exactly what they did with the the H20 to begin with, right? Making a chip specifically for the Chinese market. Yeah. Yeah. Did Dan, did did the analysts who cover the stock, do they think all the new kind of business that Jensen is able to drum up in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, how much that can potentially offset pressure in China? Well, yeah, I mean, I think that that's something that obviously it's a reprieve for them because, you know, there's there's now these, uh, uh, kind of I think, uh, Stacy Ragson, uh, had said Bernstein analyst had said that it's a a way to show that there's still deep pocketed, uh, customers out there that want access to this. And so now they have access to this. I think there was a couple hundred thousand chips that they talked about going even further beyond that, right? So there's there's a a desire for these chips, uh, and and video is going to be able to now sell them to those countries. And so the other thing is the AI diffusion rule, uh, was, you know, knocked down by the Trump administration. That was put in place by the Biden administration at the end of, kind of a last minute move by the Biden administration. Uh, and that would have set up a three-tier system of who can get, who meaning countries can get, uh, access to high-end AI chips. So the the there was the top, uh, that could just get, you know, free access to it, uh, a second layer, uh, that they would need specific licenses, and then a third where layer where countries that already have arms embargoes on them. That's gone now. The Trump administration is working on some new rules, we don't really know, but that was also, uh, good news for them in in the quarter. What do you think, uh, so lots going on. What are your sort of one number one and number two issues, just you get the print, the conference call starts, what do you want to see, what do you want to hear tomorrow? I I want to know exactly how high data center has gone. I think that's going to be the the the big thing. Uh, and then if we get any kind of commentary as to what they're going to do in China. Um, that's that'll be the big thing, I think. If they can mention that at all, right? The Reuters reports said that they're working on something, but if we get something on the earnings call itself and Jensen says, yeah, we're working on something, then obviously everybody will be a lot more excited that they're able to sell into the Chinese market. But even if they make that, there's no guarantee that that also won't eventually be cut off.",

        "header": "Why Semiconductor Stocks Broadcom, AMD, and Arm Holdings Rallied Today",
        "content": "Shares of major semiconductor stocksBroadcom(AVGO2.95%),Advanced Micro Devices(AMD3.87%), andArm Holdings(ARM5.32%)rallied on Tuesday, rising 3%, 3.9%, and 5.3%, respectively. Chip stocks generally had a good day, as President Trump announced a delay to his threat of 50% tariffs on European Union goods to July 9, seemingly paving the way for negotiations. In addition, a \"soft\" economic indicator in May's Consumer Confidence readings bounced back in a big way from its April plunge. Finally, several major chip manufacturers submitted letters to the Department of Commerce regarding upcoming potential semiconductor tariffs. Included was a threat fromTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM3.01%)that significant tariffs could derail its announced U.S. projects. Of note, all three of these companies produce their chips at TSMC's Taiwan fabs currently. Semiconductors have been some of the most sensitive to the ongoing trade andtariffcontroversies of the young Trump administration. While semiconductors are a long-term growth industry, the industry can be quitecyclical. Therefore, concerns over growth slowdowns or recessions are likely to cause turmoil in these stocks. In addition, given the very-international nature of semiconductor manufacturing, supply chains, and materials, semiconductors are doubly sensitive to all the tariff uncertainty. Will chips be tariffed? If not, what about the devices they go into, which are largely assembled overseas? How about the materials and chipmaking equipment that chipmakers use -- for instance, EUV machines, which are only available from the Netherlands? As such, the Trump administration's threat of 50% tariffs on E.U. imports sent these stocks downward on Friday. But on Sunday, President Trump announced an extension to the tariff threat to July 9 on his social media platform Truth Social, giving relief and room for continued negotiations. In addition to that relief, most economically sensitive stocks rallied upon this morning's Consumer Confidence readings for May. According to this month's survey from The Conference Board, consumer confidence bounced back in a big way to a 98 reading. That's a massive beat over the expectations of 86.3, and a 12-point increase over the April lows. During May, President Trump walked back more of his April tariff threats, perhaps most consequentially the highly punitive 145% tariff on China on May 12, to \"just\" a more manageable 30%, while trade talks continued. Given increased consumer sentiment will go a long way toward staving off a recession, it's no wonder chip stocks moved significantly higher today. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, a potential threat from TSMC to the Trump administration could be adding additional fuel to these stocks, which largely have their chips manufactured by the Taiwanese manufacturing giant in Taiwan. The Trump administration is still contemplating tariffs on foreign-made semiconductors in an effort to spur investment in U.S. chipmaking. To ease the administration's concerns, TSMC pledged an additional $100 billion investment in the U.S. a couple of months ago in March. However, that wouldn't necessarily exempt TSMC from tariffs. Last week, leading chip manufacturers all wrote responses to the U.S. Commerce Department's ongoing investigation into semiconductor tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. In TSMC's letter, TSMC Arizona Secretary T.C. Morris Cheng wrote that the imposition of tariffs on chips or equipment could threaten the viability of those future manufacturing plants announced by TSMC back in March, which were announced to great fanfare, along with leading Trump administration officials. Publishing this letter could also be helping the stocks of these chipmakers, who all produce chips at TSMC's Taiwan fabs today. The thinking could be that the Trump administration would exempt chips made by TSMC's current leading-edge operations in Taiwan, to preserve that massive investment in the U.S. If those chips are exempt, they would theoretically stay more affordable and wouldn't be disadvantaged relative to rival chips made in the U.S. In addition to the tariff and trade relief, chip stocks may also be looking forward toNvidia's(NVDA3.07%)earnings tomorrow. Nvidia's results are often used as a proxy for the strength of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure investment generally. And although Broadcom's ASICs and AMD's MI-series chips compete with Nvidia in that area, positive results could boost confidence in the overall sector. Meanwhile, Nvidia also uses Arm-based licenses to produce its own Grace CPUs that complement its GPUs, so Arm often trades alongside Nvidia as well. Last week's decline and Tuesday's bounce back just go to show that leading semiconductor stocks are some of the most volatile in the market. However, long-term investors riding out the ups and downs have profited handsomely. The sector has been the best-performing in the market over the past decade.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) suppliers, including industry leaders likeFoxconn(SS:601138), Inventec, Dell (NYSE:DELL), and Wistron, have overcome technical challenges that previously delayed shipments of Nvidia\u2019s flagship AI data center racks, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. This development marks a significant stride in the company\u2019s efforts to enhance its global sales initiatives. The technical issues, which arose toward the end of last year, had impeded the production of the highly anticipated \"Blackwell\" AI servers. These servers are expected to substantially boost computing power for training and utilizing large language models, a promise made by Nvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, upon the product\u2019s announcement last year. The resolution of these technical difficulties is a welcome relief for Nvidia, as it aims to meet its ambitious annual sales targets. The suppliers\u2019 breakthroughs have enabled the commencement of shipments, which is likely to contribute positively to the company\u2019s performance. Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell AI servers are part of a broader strategy to solidify the chipmaker\u2019s position in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence. The successful deployment of these servers is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge and fulfill the expectations set by its leadership. This latest advancement underscores Nvidia\u2019s resilience in addressing production challenges and reaffirms its commitment to delivering cutting-edge technology solutions to its customers. As shipments begin, the market is watching closely to see how this will translate into financial performance for the semiconductor giant in the coming quarters. All eyes are on NVIDIA ahead of earnings on Wednesday after the close. Shares of the AI leader closed up 3.2% on Tuesday and are up 25% over the last month, as tariff and DeepSeek fears have subsided.

        "content": "Demand for Nvidia's (NVDA) new Blackwell chips is building, and cloud giants are still spending. Patrick Moorhead, founder, CEO, and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, joins Asking for a Trend to break down why investors are watching this next phase closely. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. If I'm an Nvidia investor, I'm listening to this Patrick. There are some bulls on the street, I know, who actually get more excited about the second half. And I'm curious what you think about that, and among the reasons for the excitement, they talk about it, as you suggested, there may be this China compliant chip. They talk about, hey, listen, the cloud giants, we heard, they're going to keep spending, spending, spending, and the business with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Am I missing anything, Patrick? No, I think, uh, Nvidia's been back-end loaded for a while, and that's when, when Blackwell hits, uh, which, um, does a lot more tokens per dollar per second, and a lot of the hyperscalers are, are actually waiting, uh, for Blackwell. I do think that they didn't buy as many H series as they could have because the economics are so good for them. I also like the move where Nvidia derisked Blackwell a bit, uh, by pulling back on an aggressive chassis design where you can actually use a lot of the same components for the Blackwell 200 as you did for the Blackwell 300. So, uh, second half is, is going to be big. Uh, the capex forecasts indicate that, and Nvidia seems appears to have everything in line. Uh, looks like a little bit less risk than the first half. I want to switch gears, Patrick, get your thoughts on another tech story, which was Salesforce acquiring Informatica for $8 billion. Here was the, the skeptical take I, I saw from RBC's Rishi Jaluria. Rishi telling his clients, while on paper the deal can make sense, integrating MuleSoft, Tableau, and Data Cloud, and using that combination to power Agent force, given the lack of integration of Salesforce assets, we question this vision, he says. Furthermore, even if this logic makes sense, we wonder if there was, if there's any major advantage to buying Informatica versus partnering. What's your response to that, Patrick? So I do like the thesis here. Uh, with all the CIOs that I meet with, one of their top five impediments from rolling out and scaling generative AI is the lack of a coherent data management strategy and the tools to be able to pull all that data. In the Gen AI world, you're going from east and you're going from west as opposed to the, the ML world, which was north and south. And what that means is, uh, instead of just, let's say, uh, activating CRM data, you're connecting CRM with ERP to SCM to all these other data sets. And that's why this, this makes sense to me. It also, uh, is parallel to the big growth in Data Cloud that we've seen, uh, with Salesforce. We've seen this massive growth with even companies like SAP, right? The precursor to big Gen AI action is getting your, your data in line. I do think the comment is fair about a lack of integration, but I expect that integration to happen and needs to happen at a very quick pace. Complexity is another one of those top issues. And if Salesforce can, uh, reduce some of that complexity, reduce some of those steps, reduce some of those operational challenges, I think they have something here.",

Ultimately, investors decided to latch on to the affirmative, as they drove the stock nearly 21% higher in price. That absolutely crushed theS&P 500index's(^GSPC2.05%)otherwise impressive 2%-plus rise. CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure company that focuses on the market for high-endartificial intelligence (AI)capabilities. As such, it is a business partner of next-generation chipmakerNvidia, which also owns a substantial stake in the company. Image source: Getty Images. On Tuesday, theFinancial Timesreported that a clutch of Nvidia suppliers had surmounted technical challenges that had delayed shipments of Nvidia's AI data center racks. This had negatively affected the company's production of its Blackwell AI servers; CoreWeave hosts such servers via itscloud platform. Another positive development for CoreWeave was its Tuesday announcement of a new hire. The company tapped Carl Holshouser as its vice president of government affairs. Prior to his hiring, Holshouser served in a variety of managerial positions concerning public policy, most recently as head of federal policy and government relations at tech executive association TechNet. Investors rightfully cheered the addition of a manager steeped in experience with government entities. With these developments, the market shrugged off a recommendation downgrade from an analyst. Barclays' Raimo Lenschow changed his view on CoreWeave stock to equal weight (hold, in other words) from his previous overweight (buy). He knocked his price target down to $70 per share -- from the previous $100 -- in the process. According to reports, while Lenschow expects robust growth from the company, he feels it is too richly valued at the moment. Lenschow certainly has a point, but CoreWeave's business is red-hot these days, and likely to get hotter. Yes, it's expensive, but as we all know, quality stocks can be pricey.
