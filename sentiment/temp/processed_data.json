        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.\u2019s Jensen Huang headlines the 2025 edition of Asia\u2019s biggest electronics conference, for years a showcase for his company\u2019s cutting-edge AI chips and the companies lining up to buy them. This year, however, the spotlight may well be on another far bigger personality: US President Donald Trump. Most Read from Bloomberg As Coastline Erodes, One California City Considers \u2018Retreat Now\u2019 How a Highway Became San Francisco\u2019s Newest Park Maryland\u2019s Credit Rating Gets Downgraded as Governor Blames Trump America, \u2018Nation of Porches\u2019 Power-Hungry Data Centers Are Warming Homes in the Nordics Computex kicks off Monday in Taipei, and as in years past will draw industry chieftains from Huang and Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s Cristiano Amon to Young Liu of Foxconn, which makes the bulk of the world\u2019s iPhones and Nvidia servers. But while last year\u2019s event was a celebration of the post-ChatGPT AI boom, executives this time are likely grappling with the uncertainty of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to reshape the global trade order \u2014 disrupting a decades-old model for tech manufacturing. This year\u2019s exhibition will of course feature the hardware required to bring artificial intelligence to life. Apart from Nvidia chips, that includes server racks assembled by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn; power components from Delta Electronics Inc.; and datacenter cooling systems from Asia Vital Components Co. But while they tout new products onstage, these companies are also confronting profound questions about the US administration\u2019s tariff regime. Here are the key themes to watch out for this week. The Shifting Geography of Chip Manufacturing Trump wants manufacturing back home. To that end, the White House has secured major chipmaking commitments, most notably an additional $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. As TSMC builds out its Arizona operations with more production lines, supply chain players are also joining it in the US \u2014 and accelerating those plans because of the new tariffs. Asia\u2019s biggest electronics companies may also find new opportunity in the Middle East. In the week before Computex, a US delegation led by the president \u2014 and including tech luminaries Huang, Elon Musk and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman \u2014 visited Saudi Arabia\u2019s Riyadh with lofty promises of new trade deals. Alongside a relaxation of AI chip export rules, the visit underlines the Middle East\u2019s growing importance as a player in the AI field. \u201cThe new focus on export rules around China and Huawei means more opportunity for Taiwan,\u201d said Taipei-based industry analyst Dan Nystedt. AI\u2019s Questionable Payoff From Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to Nvidia and Qualcomm, the development of generative artificial intelligence was heralded at Computex last year as comparable to the advent of the internet. Consumers haven\u2019t responded with the same enthusiasm. Smartphone shipments grew by only 2.4% and PCs by an even slimmer 1.8% over the holiday quarter, according to industry tracker IDC. The promises from the likes of Samsung Electronics Co. about how transformative AI would be in day-to-day life have not come to pass. Apple Inc. hasn\u2019t even rolled out its full AI suite for iPhones yet. So executives at Computex will face questions about when the payoff is supposed to come. They\u2019ll also have to address concerns about an AI bubble. Investment from the biggest US internet firms remains elevated. Yet Microsoft Corp. has pulled back on some of its expansion plans, and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Joe Tsai warned against building vast data centers without knowing their purpose. Intel\u2019s New Man in Charge Lip-Bu Tan, the newly appointed chief executive officer of Intel Corp., won\u2019t be at Computex in a formal capacity as his company won\u2019t conduct its traditional keynote address. But he\u2019ll likely be doing more meetings than anyone at the show as he continues his survey of partners and customers. He\u2019s said recently that he\u2019s doing countless meetings each day and having two or three business dinners trying to get insight. Tan is currently weighing options to reform the storied US chipmaker. Intel is still the biggest provider of PC and server processors, though it\u2019s losing market share. He\u2019ll work to persuade customers of TSMC that Intel\u2019s factories are a viable alternative and that the US manufacturer \u2014 historically a rival \u2014 can be a trusted partner. The financial strain of predecessor Pat Gelsinger\u2019s spending on a turnaround plan tanked Intel\u2019s shares, particularly because it hasn\u2019t deliver tangible benefits yet. Now, Tan is rebooting everything with a focus on better execution. \u201cComputex is historically such a PC-focused event, and yet Intel seems to be sitting it out quietly,\u201d said IDC analyst Bryan Ma. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable given everything else going on in the organization right now, but their absence is notable given all of their talk about AI PCs last year.\u201d Tan, who served as CEO of chip-design software maker Cadence Design Systems Inc. for 12 years, has decades of experience investing and making deals in the semiconductor industry. At and around Computex, he\u2019ll work to reassure and recruit partners for the effort to close ground on Nvidia and TSMC. Foxconn\u2019s Debut Foxconn is making an unusually prominent appearance. Chairman Liu will host a keynote presentation on Tuesday, likely underscoring its growing role as an AI server assembler. In previous iterations of the show, the company has been represented by subsidiaries like Ingrasys Technology Inc. Foxconn is working to diversify its revenue away from assembling smartphones and other consumer electronics. It\u2019s developed an automotive division and hopes to collect bigger orders for electric vehicles. That venture gained a significant customer this month, with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. ordering a made-in-Taiwan EV for Australia and New Zealand. The company is also keen on advancing robotics. \u201cOf course AI plus robots, AI plus robots,\u201d Liu said about the focus at Computex. What\u2019s Next From Nvidia \u201cMy first night in Taipei is always dinner with C.C.,\u201d Jensen Huang said on Friday, emerging from a restaurant alongside TSMC CEO and Chairman C.C. Wei. The Nvidia boss remains a larger-than-life personality in Taiwan, with crowds following his every move. Investors will be keen to hear more about the chip designer\u2019s strategy to expand its reach. The company has been forthcoming with plans to upgrade its AI chips on a roughly annual basis, and Huang has also talked about the potential of AI in the robotics industry. Microsoft\u2019s developer event, Build, is taking place the same week over in Seattle, and speculation has grown in recent times about Nvidia joining Qualcomm in building more AI-capable, Arm-based chips for PCs. \u201cI\u2019m keeping my eyes and ears open for whatever Nvidia and MediaTek might confirm around their rumored Windows-on-Arm solution,\u201d said IDC\u2019s Ma. That might further challenge Intel\u2019s traditional stronghold. In the days leading up to Computex, Huang joined a US delegation to the Middle East led by the president, lauding the opening up of trade. The scrapping of Biden-era AI chip rules will help the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia acquire more of Nvidia\u2019s industry-leading technology and expand their capabilities in artificial intelligence. \u201cWith proper forecasting, we would be able to build the necessary technologies for everyone,\u201d Huang said to Bloomberg News on Saturday. --With assistance from Ian King.

        "header": "Palantir Stock vs. Nvidia Stock: Billionaires Buy One and Sell the Other",
        "content": "Institutional asset managers recently published theirForms 13Ffor the first quarter, and the filings revealed a somewhat surprising trend: Two billionaire hedge fund managers with exceptional track records purchasedPalantir Technologies(PLTR1.00%)and soldNvidia(NVDA0.28%), as detailed below: Citadel and Millennium are two of the three most profitable hedge funds in history in terms of net gains since inception, which makes Israel Englander and Ken Griffin good sources of inspiration. But the trades listed above took place in the first quarter, which ended about 45 days ago. Here is a more current look at Palantir and Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Palantir develops analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) software that helps organizations make sense of complex data. The International Data Corporation (IDC) recently ranked the company as the market leader in decision intelligence platforms, andForrester Researchrecognized the company as a technology leader in artificial intelligence (AI) andmachine learningplatforms. Palantir looked strong in the first quarter. Customers increased 39% to 769, and the average spend per existing customer climbed 24%. In turn, revenue increased 39% to $884 million due to particularly strong sales growth in the government segment.\u00a0Andnon-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles)earnings climbed 62% to $0.13 per diluted share. Management attributed the strong results to demand for its AI platform, and the company has continued to lean into that opportunity since the quarter ended. In April, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) purchased the Maven Smart System from Palantir, an AI platform that fuses data from multiple sources (like drones and satellites) to improve battlefield situational awareness. The NATO deal comes on the heels of the $100 million contract awarded to Palantir in September to provide multiple U.S. military services with access to Maven. Importantly, Palantir's revenue growth has now accelerated in seven straight quarters, and management raised its full-year guidance following strong first-quarter results. Clearly, the business is firing on all cylinders. But the stock commands an absurdly rich valuation of 64times forward sales. The next-closest software stock isCrowdStrikeat 18 times forward sales, according to Louie DiPalma at William Blair Research. That means Palantir could fall 70% and still be the most expensive software stock on the market. I think Palantir will be worth much more in the future, so current shareholders who plan to keep the stock for several years can sit tight, provided they are comfortable with volatility. But prospective buyers should wait for a cheaper entry point. The median target price on Wall Street is $100 per share, which implies 22% downside from the current share price of $129. I would feel more comfortable buying shares at that level. Nvidia develops accelerated computing solutions. The company is best known forgraphics processing units (GPUs), chips that are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like AI. Nvidia accounts for about 90% of AI accelerator sales, and the market is forecast to expand at 24% annually through 2030. The company is truly unique due to its full-stack strategy. Nvidia supplements its GPUs with adjacent data center hardware likecentral processing units (CPUs)and networking gear. It also offers a software platform called CUDA that comprises hundreds of code libraries and pretrained models that help developers write AI applications across use cases, such as conversational assistants, autonomous robots, and predictive analytics. Nvidia reported impressive financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 78% to $39 billion on strong sales growth in the data center segment, driven by demand for AI infrastructure. And non-GAAP net income jumped 71% to $0.89 per diluted share. Nvidia recently received some good news from the Trump administration. Last week, the Commerce Department rescinded the Biden-era \"AI Diffusion\" rule that would have limited the quantity of advanced chips Nvidia could sell in most countries around the world. The company has already capitalized on the rule rescission bystriking deals to help Saudi Arabian companies build AI factories. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will grow 46% in fiscal 2026, which ends in January. That consensus makes the current valuation of 45 times earnings look surprisingly cheap. Those numbers give aprice-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratioof 1. To put that into context, Palantir currently has a terribly expensive PEG ratio of 8.5. So, why did Ken Griffin and Israel Englander trim their positions in Nvidia? I would hazard a guess at profit taking or portfolio rebalancing. But I doubt it signals a material lack of confidence in the chipmaker. Not only do both hedge funds still own Nvidia shares, but the stock is also Millennium Management's second-largest holding, excluding options contracts.",

        "header": "The Top Tech Stock Winners From Trump's $600 Billion Saudi Arabian Deal",
        "content": "Following a visit to Saudi Arabia last week, President Donald Trump announced that the kingdom has pledged to invest $600 billion in deals with U.S. companies. The agreement includes $142 billion in defense sales to help supply the country with \"state-of-the-art warfighting equipment.\" However, the two biggest winners are U.S. chipmakersNvidia(NVDA0.28%)andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.91%). Following Trump's announcement, both companies revealed deals to provide chips to Humain, a Saudi Arabianartificial intelligence (AI)start-up owned by the kingdom's public investment fund. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia announced it will supply Humain with several hundred thousand of its most advancedgraphics processing units (GPUs)over the next five years to help power the AI data centers the company will begin building in Saudi Arabia. It will begin by shipping 18,000 of its GB300 Grace Blackwell AI supercomputer chips, while it will also provide InfiniBand networking equipment. In addition, the Saudi Data & AI Authority (SDAIA) will deploy up to 5,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enable smart city solutions. Nvidia will also help train thousands of developers in the country and deploy the country's first Omniverse Cloud to simulate and test physical AI solutions. Bank of Americaanalysts estimated that the deal could be worth between $15 billion to $20 billion in total spending over the length of the agreement. That would equal $3 billion to $5 billion in annual sales. In addition, the U.S. is reportedly close to easing chip export restrictions on the United Arab Emirates. The deal would let the nation import 500,000 advanced AI chips a year through at least 2027. About 20% of the chips would go to Abu Dhabi AI company G42, with the rest distributed to U.S. companies building data centers in the country. The deals should help replace some of the company's lost revenue to China, after the U.S. tightened export controls to the country. China accounted for about $17 billion of Nvidia's revenue last fiscal year, but it said it was down to mid-single digits of its data center revenue in fiscal Q4. Based on its Q4 run rate, that would be about $7 billion a year. AMD, meanwhile, announced it had struck a $10 billion deal with Humain to supply chips to the company over the next five years. AMD said it will provide the full spectrum of its AI compute portfolio, which seemingly means both GPUs andcentral processing units (CPUs). It also signed a memorandum of understanding with SDAIA to explore using AMD chips to power future AI-focused data centers. When it reported its Q1 results, AMD noted that it would take a $700 million hit in revenue in Q2 due to new Chinese export restrictions and $1.5 billion for the year. With the Humain deal being worth $2 billion a year, that should replace much of this lost revenue. In addition to the deals helping replace lost Chinese revenue, they also mark what could be one of the next big growth drivers for the chipmakers: sovereign AI investments. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are clearly looking to invest in AI and data centers, but they are not the only countries. Just within the Middle East, Kuwait has partnered withMicrosoftto help position the company as a regional AI leader. Bahrain and Qatar are also spending to build out AI infrastructure in their countries. Outside of the Middle East, India has partnerships with the big threecloud computingcompanies to help scale its AI infrastructure. Even smaller countries like Singapore are allocating money toward AI. Meanwhile, it seems like President Trump is willing to use the AI semiconductor dominance of the U.S. as a bargaining chip in trade deals. As the U.S. negotiates a new trade deal with China, perhaps the recent chip restrictions could even be rescinded. Both Nvidia and AMD are well-positioned to benefit from increased AI infrastructure spending. Nvidia is the clear leader in the GPU space with an over 80% market share, and should continue to see strong growth as data center spending continues to ramp up. Meanwhile, AMD has proven to be a leader when it comes to supplying CPUs for data centers. It's also carved a nice niche in the GPU market forAI inference. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than AI model training, the company is well situated. In addition, both stocks are attractively valued, with each trading around a 30 timesforward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)and a lot of growth potential still ahead.  Data byYCharts. As such, both stocks look like attractive investment options right now, given the growth opportunities both still have ahead.",

        "content": "Investors have been in love withApplefor a long time. It was the largest company in the world by market capitalization for many years, driven by the growth of the iPhone. Now, it has been eclipsed by competitors likeMicrosoftandNvidiaas Apple's revenue growth slows in the face of rapid growth from these other technology players. While Microsoft and Nvidia are solid bets to reach a $10 trillion market cap, I think another big technology player will get there first:Amazon(AMZN0.18%). Its dual growth engines and profit margin expansion potential have the company poised to be the first stock to eclipse a $10 trillion valuation. Here's why Amazon -- not Apple -- will be the first stock to a $10 trillion market cap. Image source: Getty Images. What makes Amazon special is its leading presence in two different sectors worth several hundred billion dollars, which will eventually grow into multitrillion-dollar opportunities. These are e-commerce and cloud computing. E-commerce is still less than 20% of retail sales in the United States and has steadily grown for many decades. There is no reason to think this growth trajectory will slow anytime soon. Amazon's combined North America and international sales were more than $500 billion over the last 12 months. When considering the long-term tailwind of e-commerce adoption, growing GDP around the world, and inflation, I believe these segments will easily double and surpass $1 trillion in revenue, with plenty of room to still grow. Cloud computing is getting supercharged by artificial intelligence (AI), which is taking the industry, once thought to have a $1 trillion addressable market, to become much larger. Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is going to capture the majority of the company's planned $100 billion in capital expenditures in 2025. Growing 17% year over year at $112 billion in revenue, I think AWS has a clear path to expand to $200 billion and eventually $300 billion in revenue over the next decade and beyond. What makes Amazon a special case among the large technology players is the potential for great margin expansion at its increasingly large size. Over the last 12 months, Amazon'soperating marginwas 11% compared to Microsoft's 45%. Amazon's unit economics mean it will likely never reach a 45% profit margin, but there is much more room to grow compared to its cloud computing competitor. AWS has an operating margin approaching 40% and is becoming a larger part of Amazon's business every year. Advertising, third-party seller services, and subscriptions are growing quickly at Amazon's retail segment. These will all be a rising tide to lift Amazon's profitability over the next 10 to 20 years. In the long run, I expect its operating margin to eclipse 20% due to the fast growth of these higher-margin segments.  AMZN Operating Margin (TTM)data byYCharts Whether it takes 10, 15, or 20 years, I think Amazon's combined revenue will eventually reach $2 trillion. Its competitors in big tech do not have the large addressable market afforded to Amazon by dominating both e-commerce and cloud computing, which will limit revenue growth over the next 10 to 20 years. AI should supercharge growth in cloud computing over the next decade. $2 trillion in revenue and a 20% operating margin equates to $400 billion in operating earnings. A $10 trillion market cap versus $400 billion in earnings is an earnings ratio of 25, which is entirely reasonable for a company like Amazon. Compared to other technology players, Amazon has a much clearer revenue growth path to help it achieve the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual earnings needed to warrant this valuation. It may take over a decade, but Amazon stock is my bet to be the first stock with a $10 trillion market value.",

        "header": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Before May 28",
        "content": "Every previous time that shares ofNvidia(NVDA0.28%)fell 30% or more presented a tremendous buying opportunity for investors. History appears to be repeating itself. Nvidia has mounted a strong comeback after declining as much as 37% from its previous peak set early this year. Is it too late to get in on the rebound? I don't think so. Here are three reasons to buy Nvidia stock hand over fist before May 28. Why May 28? That's when Nvidia is scheduled to announce its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which ended on April 27, 2025. Quarterly earnings updates often provide nice catalysts for the chip stock. Based on Nvidia's past performance, there's a good reason for investors to be optimistic about the Q1 update sparking a further surge in the company's share price. TheGPUmaker has topped consensus Wall Street earnings estimates in each of the previous four quarters by at least 5%. Granted, an earnings beat doesn't always translate to a bump in Nvidia's share price. For example, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, while analysts expected adjusted EPS of $0.85. However, Nvidia's shares fell despite the better-than-expected earnings. That could happen again, even if Nvidia outpaces Wall Street's earnings projections. But my hunch is that investors are looking for a reason to be bullish about the once-high-flying stock again. If I'm right, a positive earnings surprise could be just what they need to resume piling into the stock. We can't assume that Nvidia will beat earnings estimates just because it has done so in the past. However, hints from several major customers are encouraging about the company's prospects of exceeding expectations. AmazonCEO Andy Jassy said in his company's Q1 earnings call that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been aggressive in installing Nvidia AI chips as well as its own Trainium chips. He added, \"[A]s fast as we actually put the capacity in, it's being consumed.\" Jassy noted that AWS will deploy \"a lot more\" of Nvidia's next-generation GPUs and its Trainium chips over the next several months. Image source: Nvidia. Microsoftcontinues to expand its data center capacity, opening new data centers in 10 countries in its latest quarter. CFO Amy Hood said in the fiscal 2025 Q3 earnings call that demand is outpacing capacity for AI services. She revealed that Microsoft \"expect[s] to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June.\" That bodes well for Nvidia. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parentAlphabet, highlighted Google's ties with Nvidia in his company's Q1 earnings call. Pichai noted, \"Our strong relationship with Nvidia continues to be a key advantage for us and our customers.\" He added that Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer Nvidia's B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs to customers and planned to deploy Nvidia's new Vera Rubin GPUs as well. Speaking of Blackwell, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated in his company's last quarterly update that demand for the new GPUs is \"extraordinary.\" CFO Colette Kress mentioned in her comments, \"We delivered $11 billion of Blackwell revenue to meet strong demand. This is the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale.\" I expect Blackwell to be the key source of good news for Nvidia when the company reports its fiscal 2026 Q1 results later this month. Kress expects a \"significant ramp\" for the new GPU in Q1. The good news probably won't be just about the Q1 numbers, though. Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell Ultra GPU in the second half of this year. Blackwell Vera Rubin chips are expected to begin shipping in 2026. I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia provides a rosy outlook for these next-generation chips in its Q1 update. While I think buying Nvidia stock before May 28 could be a smart move because of these three reasons, there's one reason investors might want to hold off. The Trump administration'stariffsand overall trade policies continue to cause major uncertainty for the economy, especially for Nvidia. I'm not convinced that the recent relaxation of tensions with China is as positive as some investors think. The pause in exceptionally high tariffs lasts for only 90 days. Steep tariffs of 30% on Chinese imports remain in place, while China will continue to levy tariffs of 10% on U.S. imports. Nvidia could beat earnings expectations and provide an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year. But if the trade dynamics change for the worse between now and May 28, that might not be enough to propel the stock higher over the near term. Over the long term, though, I think Nvidia's future remains bright. If you buy the stock and hold it for the next five to 10 years, I predict you'll make money -- regardless of whether you buy it over the next few weeks or over the next few months.",

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Could Rally After May 28",
        "content": "A long-time darling of the stock market,Nvidia's(NVDA0.28%)stock fell more than 40% from its 52-week high in January 2025 to a 52-week low in April 2025. Investors were concerned about the potential decline in enterprise spending onartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure and the impact of tariff wars. However, investor sentiment has recently turned for the better after Nvidia announced recent developments regarding its partnership with Humain, a new AI-focused branch of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The stock has recovered most of its losses and is up 30% in the last month. While the stock remains approximately 9% below its January high, it appears positioned to surge in the coming months, especially after it releases its first-quarter 2026 earnings results (for the period ending April 27) on May 28. Image Source: Getty Images. Here are some reasons that support this hypothesis. Nvidia is an undisputed leader, accounting for roughly a 90% share of the data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market. The company stands to benefit significantly from the rapid expansion in data center capital expenditures, projected to increase from roughly $500 billion in 2025 to$1 trillionby 2028. Many cloud players reiterated their commitments to investing in AI infrastructure, which contradicts the narrative of a potential slowdown in AI spending. Nvidia's market dominance is also set to continue, as evidenced by the robust demand for its Blackwell architecture systems, which are in full production across multiple configurations. Blackwell is already a success, accounting for $11 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. Blackwell has been optimized for running inference workloads, including the real-time deployment of AI models, such as computationally intensive reasoning AI or long-term thinking models.AI inferencepresents a significantly larger opportunity than AI training workloads, since a trained model is used multiple times in production. By offering dramatically higher price performance than previous Hopper architecture chips, Blackwell is well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. In April 2025, Nvidia announced plans to build up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. within the next four years in partnership with several manufacturing players. Both the AI chips and other supercomputer components will be manufactured entirely in the U.S. This move could enable the company to mitigate the risks associated with its supply chain, which is currently significantly vulnerable to geopolitical tensions. Nvidia is also committed to maintaining its technological superiority in the AI chip market. The company plans to release the Blackwell Ultra system in the second half of 2025 and the next-generation Vera Rubin architecture in 2026. In addition to hardware, Nvidia has built a robust software ecosystem comprising mainly the CUDA programming model, NVLink and Spectrum-X networking technologies, software solutions for optimizing and deploying AI models, and domain-specific libraries. With 5.9 million developers in its ecosystem, this has become a solid competitive moat, difficult for competitors to replicate. In May 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce revoked the Biden-era AI Diffusion interim rule, which was set to take effect on May 15. This is good news for Nvidia, as the rule would severely restrict the export of AI chips to several countries. With fewer restrictions on international sales, investors can expect stronger revenue guidance for the rest of fiscal 2026. Furthermore, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a dramatic reduction in trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with U.S.tariffson Chinese goods dropping from 145% to 30% and Chinese duties on U.S. imports dropping from 125% to 10% during the 90-day pause period. President Donald Trump is referring to this event as a \"total reset\" in U.S.-China relations, which may signal a more favorable international environment in the coming months. Lower tariffs can benefit Nvidia, as the company relies extensively on the global supply chain for components and manufacturing. With reduced cost pressures, investors could see better margin projections for Nvidia in the coming quarters. Nvidia's revenue growth trajectory has been exceptional for the past few years. The company guided for revenues of $43 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, implying 63% to 67% year-over-year growth. Despite this impressive growth, Nvidia currently trades at 25.4 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 69.2 times. This steep discount is unjustifiable in the current market environment. Considering Nvidia's robust AI-optimized ecosystem, cutting-edge technological offerings, and historical tendency to report performance that exceeds guidance, there is a high likelihood that the company will deliver better-than-expected results in the first quarter. The company could also provide strong guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2026. This, in turn, will boost investor confidence and could trigger either an increase in future earnings estimates, expansion in valuation multiples toward the historical averages, or both. Hence, with its current reasonable valuation, the stock seems well positioned to soar significantly in the coming months.",

        "content": "Home Depot (HD) and rival Lowe's (LOW) are scheduled to report quarterly financial results on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, with analysts largely bullish on both home improvement retailers' stocks. Of the 13 analysts covering Home Depot tracked by Visible Alpha, 11 have issued \"buy\" or equivalent ratings, while two have neutral ratings. Meanwhile, 10 out of 15 analysts covering Lowe's call it a \"buy,\" with five \"hold\" ratings. The mean price targets for both stocks\u2014at $436 for Home Depot and $270 for Lowe's\u2014would suggest roughly 15% upside from Friday's closing levels. First-quarter sales for Home Depot are expected to rise 8% year-over-year to $39.26 billion, while Lowe's revenue is projected to drop 2% to $20.95 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to decline for both retailers\u2014to $3.56 and $2.87, respectively. Ahead of the reports, analysts from UBS said that while they are not \"expecting any real earth-shattering news\" from the first-quarter results, they like the stocks for several reasons. The analysts pointed to relatively stable demand despite tariff uncertainty, with room for improvement later this year if thehousing market turns around. Morgan Stanley analysts echoed the comments, and called the retailers \"high quality bellwethers.\" They expect both retailers to hold their previous full-year forecasts steady, but noted that they could introduce broader ranges to reflect the uncertainty, assome other companies have done this earnings season. JPMorgan analysts recently trimmed their price targets for Home Depot and Lowe's to $410 and $263, respectively, from $470 and $300 previously. They lowered their comparable sales projections for the first quarter as the analysts said they believe tariff-fueled uncertainty \"is having an effect on bigger ticket spending,\" acategory Lowe'sand Home Depotstruggled with last yearas squeezed consumers avoided big purchases.",

        "content": "CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) shares surged 22% on May 16 and touched $80 after Nvidia Corp.\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) SEC filing (13G) revealed that it held around 24.2 million shares, or a 7% stake, as of March 31. Investors' confidence in CoreWeave appears to have risen multi-fold after this disclosure, as the stake now is higher than the 5.2% stake known to the Street since the company filed its IPO prospectus. IPO'ed just two months ago, CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) provides AI developers and enterprises with cloud-based graphics processing unit (GPU) infrastructure, primarily based on Nvidia GPUs. This relationship closely ties CoreWeave\u2019s growth to advancements in the latter\u2019s chips, enabling the company to offer customers the most advanced computing power. As a result, a greater backing from Nvidia corresponds to significant long-term potential for CoreWeave from AI infrastructure demand. Just a day before this news, the company released stronger-than-expected Q1 2025 results with an impressive 420% and 550% year-over-year increase in revenue and adjusted operating income, respectively. Encouraged by the solid results in an otherwise volatile earnings season, JP Morgan analyst Mark Murphy raised his share price target by 54% to $66 (from $43), while maintaining his Overweight rating. The company announced some new deals, including one from a hyperscaler customer (speculated to be Google) and another $4 billion expansion from an AI company. The analyst hailed these deals as a welcome diversification of CoreWeave\u2019s customer base and positive near-term growth catalysts. He likes the company's strong revenue backlog and its focus on expanding enterprise customer base, which support his positive opinion on the company. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWV and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings It has been a week. Stocks entered the green for the year asinvestors cheeredthe US-China trade thaw. Five CEOs this week reminded me that this is a truce, not an agreement, and one top Fortune 500 executive who recently met with the Trump administration to discuss tariffs told me the 30% level could be the new norm, barring a major breakthrough. The \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 continued theirrenewed ascent. Earnings from economic bellwethers Cisco (CSCO) and Walmart (WMT) didn't completely suck (thoughthey were not perfect). We even had some history at the Nasdaq.On his IPO day, eToro's (ETOR) co-founder and CEO, Yoni Assia, pointed out that his dad took a software company public at the exchange in 1991. They became the first father and son to take a company public on the Nasdaq. You will also notice that we actually had our first major post-\"Liberation Day\" IPO, though I am hearing that any other big name eyeing public markets will be waiting until the fall, at least. Through all of this frenzied activity, you may be surprised what has really gotten under my skin. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy I am reminded how absolutely useless earnings estimates and corporate guidance (if a company decides to issue it) are in a backdrop where one social media post could blow up a company's careful financial planning. If you are relying on earnings estimates and corporate guidance to inform your investing decision-making process right now, just stop it. It's a total waste of time. \"If [CEOs] didn't get away from [guidance], they should,\" former Medtronic (MDT) CEO Bill George said on Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bidpodcast (see video above or listen below). \"I think they're smart to pull it.\" George told me off-camera that, in the 10 years when he was the CEO of Medtronic, he only missed earnings estimates once, in part because he thought the price-earnings ratio on the stock was too high and wanted to reset expectations more reasonably. So the guy \u2014 who also sat on the boards of Target, ExxonMobil, and Goldman Sachs \u2014 knows what he is talking about here. \"I'm just shooting in the wind to give you a number when I don't know what the ground rules are,\" George explained. \"If you tell me what the ground rules are, I'll tell you what we'll do. But I need to have some ground rules. I'll tell you when new products are coming to market; I can give you some idea of how we're going to do revenue-wise and help you figure it out.\" Look at what's going on out there. Walmart reiterated its full-year earnings per share forecast on Thursday after ratcheting down expectations at an investor event several weeks ago. Executives went on to say they would start raising prices (by double digits in some cases,CFO John David Rainey told me and Madison Millson Yahoo Finance's Catalysts). If tariffs go back to pre-thaw levels, it may render guidance obsolete. The stock gets hit. Yet, the guidance is out there. Why bother? Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiztold me last weekthat he decided to pull guidance altogether because of the trade uncertainty that could spur him to take major price increases on toys soon. United Airlines (UAL) still has itsdouble guidance range out there(which numerous execs have privately made fun of). Yet despite all the confusion, we have the Street looking for earnings growth north of 10% this year. How is that believable in this topsy-turvy climate? It's not. \"I guess there'll be some winners and losers,\" veteran strategist and Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said. \"So stock pickers maybe can navigate their way through it. But I think the whole system's earnings are too high, and they're going to come down. The stock market can go up when earnings come down, for sure, but they're higher than normal. And we had tariffs. It just feels like that's not all in the price [of stocks].\" Maybe I am making a big deal out of nothing on this topic. Drop me a line either way on X@BrianSozziwith your thoughts. I am just in the camp where earnings estimates and guidance have historically proven to be important drivers of stock prices. To the extent they no longer are, I view it as one more problem for investors to contend with in a challenging 2025. Brian Sozziis Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Recently Commented On These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. During Thursday\u2019s episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer cautioned investors against letting excessive pessimism shape how they approach the stock market. \u201cMy view, you can be as cynical and corrosive as you want about the vast majority of things in the world in life. But if you\u2019re trying to make big money in the stock market, you\u2019re actually better off being critical and constructive. Reflexive negativity is not a smart strategy, and you\u2019ll most certainly trade yourself into oblivion with very little show for it.\u201d READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Put These 8 Stocks Under a Microscope RecentlyandJim Cramer Commented on These 6 Natural Gas Players. Cramer pointed out that markets often offer strong opportunities, especially on days when sentiment is low, and if investors remain too skeptical, they miss out. He emphasized that these chances do not appear in isolation; they show up often in what he called \u201cthe greatest market in the world.\u201d As per Cramer, many stocks that were once dismissed or \u201cleft for dead\u201d ended up rebounding. He noted, \u201cThe cynics missed all of these moves,\u201d and went on to say, \u201cYou could have caught all of them.\u201d \u201cSo here\u2019s the bottom line: If you examined these same opportunities with a jaundiced eye, too critical, too negative, I know what would\u2019ve happened. You would\u2019ve passed on all of them. But if you were open-minded, if you were constructive, any one of these could easily have made you a boatload of money.\u201d For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on May 15. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 While the stock got brought down due to many investors backing out of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the AI data center thesis was considered to be over, Cramer noted that the stock might go higher. \u201cOr let\u2019s not forget the best of them all, which is NVIDIA. Not long ago, people decided that despite ample evidence to the contrary, the big AI data center thesis was just over, kaput. The Chinese had supposedly come up with a better mousetrap. Remember that DeepSeek issue? The Biden administration put up barriers that prevented NVIDIA from selling chips to most countries. Unbelievable. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) develops computing, graphics, and networking solutions used in areas like gaming, AI, data centers, and automotive technology. The company provides hardware, software, and cloud services designed to support advanced computing and enterprise AI. Overall, NVDAranks 5thon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

On his last stop of the Gulf tour, Trump inked a massive AI data centre project where the two countries will be partnering on an artificial intelligence campus. Trump noted that the United Arab Emirates and the United States had agreed on a path for the Gulf country to buy advanced AI semiconductors from U.S. companies.

        "content": "Growing investor confidence on US trade dealshas sent stocks totheir highest levels in more than two months. Last week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 5.3% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 7.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 3.4%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have now recouped their losses from the initial tariff-driven sell-off in early April and are in positive territory year to date. Tariff headlines will remain in focus in the coming week, a quiet one for scheduled announcements in markets. Updates on activity in the manufacturing sector and weekly filings for unemployment highlight the light economic calendar. With the bulk of companies done reporting first quarter earnings, results from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Workday (WDAY) will be in focus. The top story in markets remains Trump's trade war.News of a 90-day tariff pause with Chinasent stocks roaring last week and prompted several Wall Street strategists to getmore bullishon their outlooks for the S&P. President Trumpsaid Fridaythat the US will set tariff rates for its trading partners within the next few weeks. In a note to clients defending his year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee wrote that if \"tariff deals are soon announced, equities can further recover.\" But strategists have also noted that most tariffs are just paused, with negotiations for actual deals still ongoing. This leaves a considerable amount of policy uncertainty lingering in markets. \"I do think we still need to be a little bit cautious until we have a more cemented agreement, not just with China but with Europe as well. And that's still on the back burner,\" Victoria Fernandez, Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist, told Yahoo Finance. Many economists have arguedrecession odds significantly decreasedover the past week following the latest tariff pause. This has coincided with a shift in the market's expectations for the Federal Reserve this year. Investor bets on the Fed's next interest rate cut now favor July, a shift from chances favoring June prior to the tariff delay,per the CME FedWatch Tool.Bloomberg data shows markets are now pricing just two 25 basis point interest rate cuts for the full year, down from three seen the week prior. With limited new data coming in the week ahead, focus will shift to the nine scheduled speeches from Federal Reserve members. But Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave doesn't believe investors will learn much new about the Fed's wait-and-see approach. \"We don't expect a major change in tone relative to recent Fedspeak: most speakers will likely emphasize patience, highlighting the uncertainty ahead and the importance of looking at the totality of policies, not just tariffs,\" Bhave wrote in a note to clients. Bhave holds an out-of-consensus call for the Fed not to cut interest rates at all in 2025. \"In order to cut, the Fed will need to see clear evidence that either the labor market has deteriorated substantially, or inflation has started to ease with the tariff impact behind us,\" Bhave wrote. \"Neither outcome seems imminent.\" For now, Fed rate cuts being pushed back hasn't shaken the market as investors have poured into risk assets amid the more optimistic growth outlook for the US economy. After leadingthe S&P 500 to two consecutive years of over 20% gains,the \"Magnificent 7\" tech stockshave held back the benchmark index in 2025. Research from DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas published on Friday showed the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) accounted for allof the S&P 500's declinein the first quarter. In fact, without the Magnificent Seven, the S&P 500 would be up 2% this year, per Colas's work. Recently, the tides have begun to shift. The Big Tech cohort has accounted for 60% of the S&P 500's gains since the beginning of May, withlarge rallies from Nvidia, Microsoft, andTesla leading the charge. Both Tesla and Nvidia are up about 30% or more over the past month, while Microsoft has rallied about 20%. Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin boosted his year-end S&P 500 target from 5,900 to 6,100 after the China tariff pause and believes another Big Tech rally could be in store after a strong first quarter earnings season for the group. \"We expect investors will be attracted to the secular earnings growth profiles of many AI-exposed equities against a backdrop of modest economic growth, especially in light of relatively undemanding current valuations,\" Kostin wrote.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 For most of the past decade, a handful of high-flying technology companies have pushed the US stock market to record highs and become cornerstones of investment portfolios. But that\u2019s collapsed this year. Most Read from Bloomberg As Coastline Erodes, One California City Considers \u2018Retreat Now\u2019 How a Highway Became San Francisco\u2019s Newest Park Maryland\u2019s Credit Rating Gets Downgraded as Governor Blames Trump America, \u2018Nation of Porches\u2019 Power-Hungry Data Centers Are Warming Homes in the Nordics Despite the S&P 500 Index (^SPX) clawing back into the green for 2025 after being whipsawed by President Donald Trump\u2019s vacillating trade policies, tech giants like Apple Inc (AAPL)., Alphabet Inc (GOOG)., Amazon.com Inc (AMZN). and Tesla Inc (TSLA). are still down. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index \u2014 which includes those companies as well as Meta Platforms Inc (META)., Microsoft Corp (MSFT). and Nvidia Corp (NVDA). \u2014 is underperforming the S&P 500, and if that holds through Dec. 31, it would make this just the second year in the last 10 where that\u2019s happened. It\u2019s a far cry from last year, when technology and telecommunications stocks both rose more than 35% to lead the S&P 500\u2019s 23% gain. This year, typically lagging groups like industrials, utilities and financials are driving the stock market\u2019s rebound. Whether Big Tech can re-establish its historical dominance in 2025 is the existential question facing investors as they start positioning for the back half of the year. \u201cThe market is starting to look back more at individual stocks and companies and financial strength and innovation rather than letting the uncertainty around tariffs and where they may go really dominate the conversation,\u201d said Rick Gardner, chief investment officer at RGA Investments. \u201cAnd if you want to start talking about the US economy and you want to start talking about technology, that\u2019s a really bright story.\u201d Gardner has been buying Big Tech stocks for his clients over the past month as the market has rebounded but they\u2019ve languished. He\u2019s not alone. Signs are emerging that professional traders are increasingly wading back in after slashing equity positioning amid the economic uncertainty triggered by Trump\u2019s global trade war. For example, hedge funds on Tuesday snapped up US equities at the fastest pace since April 9, the day the S&P 500 soared 9.5% after Trump announced his tariff reprieve, according to Goldman Sachs\u2019 prime brokerage desk. Technology stocks were the biggest beneficiaries of the buying. Not A Good Setup The flipside of this optimism is the reality that tech stocks have had a massive runup over the past few years, and with the economy in flux the risk is these shares could have much more room to fall. Betting on Big Tech a decade ago resulted in a gain of 2,179%, compared with 181% for the S&P 500, excluding dividends. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to stall out here,\u201d Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief investment officer, said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to justify the numbers.\u201d Hedge fund manager Michael Burry, who\u2019s famous for his 2008 bet against the housing market that was featured in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d bought put options, which profit from price declines, on Nvidia in the first quarter, according to the latest 13F regulatory filing by his firm, Scion Asset Management. However, the filing also added a note that the securities \u201cmay serve to hedge long positions which are not eligible to be reported.\u201d That said, the stock market\u2019s big \u201cwhat if\u201d question is: If those Big Tech laggards start to outperform again, what does that mean for the S&P 500? The Magnificent Seven accounts for about a third of the benchmark\u2019s market capitalization. So if the mega-tech index, which is down 4.2% for the year compared with a 1.3% rise in the S&P 500, reverses course and takes the lead, how much does the S&P rally? \u201cI think all-time highs are possible,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cI would hate to be the one betting against our technology industry and innovation right now.\u201d He has a point, since the S&P 500 bottomed on April, tech stocks have led the way higher, with the sector rising 31% compared with a 20% gain for the entire index. Of course, not all Big Tech stocks have been underperformers this year. Meta Platforms is up 9.4% to lead the Magnificent Seven, while Microsoft has gained 7.8%. Both have limited exposure to tariffs and posted better-than-expected earnings results. Nvidia, which reports on May 28, is roughly flat for 2025. Betting on a tech rally comes with its own risks. Trump could resume his hard-line approach to tariffs when his 90-day pause ends in July. And the jury is still out on whether a demand shock from his levies will derail the US economic expansion and cause inflation to flare up again. Economic Fears So far businesses have absorbed most of the costs from Trump\u2019s tariffs, but Walmart Inc. said in its earnings report last week that consumers will start to see higher prices soon as it works through inventory and begins to pass on the expense of newer merchandise. Meanwhile, US consumer sentiment is at the second-lowest level on record and inflation expectations are at multi-decade highs, according to the monthly survey by the University of Michigan. While the factors weighing on big tech laggards vary, the common challenge most of them face is exposure to China, which has been hit with the highest tariffs by the Trump administration. For instance, the majority of Apple\u2019s most important device, the iPhone, are still mostly made in China, and the country accounted for 17% of its 2024 revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company earlier this month reported a 2% decline in China sales in its fiscal second quarter, short of analyst expectations. Apple has lost more than $700 billion in market value since closing at a record on Dec. 26 and is now worth less than Microsoft and Nvidia. Alphabet, meanwhile, faces mounting concerns about risks to its Google search business from artificial intelligence chatbots like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Searches on Apple\u2019s Safari web browser fell for the first time in April, an Apple executive said in court testimony last week. Still, hope for equity investors remains. In many ways the most encouraging sign for the stock market has been the S&P 500\u2019s ability to rebound without big tech companies leading, according to George Maris, chief investment officer and global head of equities at Principal Asset Management. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need the largest capitalization securities to do great for a good, constructive market,\u201d he said. \u201cYou probably have a healthier market, a healthier, more fundamentally-oriented market, if you have greater participation across the investment universe.\u201d \u2014With assistance from Alexandra Semenova.

        "content": "Whether you were unable to save as much as you hoped to when you were younger or had to dip into your retirement accounts early, leaving the workforce withlimited savings can make fully retiring difficult. According to a 2024 BlackRock survey, less than half (47%) of retirement savers said they felt they were on track to retire with the lifestyle they wanted. Three-fifths said they were worried they would outlive their retirement funds. Retiring with a smallernest eggcan be challenging, but with strategic planning and informed decisions, it's possible to transition into retirement successfully. Before you decide to retire, it's essential to get an idea of your finances. You'll want to take stock of how much you have saved up across different accounts, whether that's your bank accounts,brokerage accounts, 401(k)s, orindividual retirement accounts (IRAs). \"'Do I have enough?' This is probably the question I get asked the most often,\" said MaryAnne Gucciardi, a CFP and founder of Wealthmind Financial Planning. \"For clients, I start with a model [that includes] what they're spending, what's coming in, and what they really want to do.\" Ultimately, how much you want to have saved up depends on what you think you're spending will look like in retirement. If you don't have a financial planner, it could be helpful to use a common rule-of-thumb, like the4% rule, to figure out if you have enough money. With the 4% rule, a retiree can take a 4% withdrawal from their nest egg the first year of retirement and then adjust it every year after that for inflation. This approach is designed to make your savings last for approximately 30 years. If your annual expenses are $60,000, by following the 4% rule, you would aim to save 25 times that amount, or $1.5 million. This approach, however, doesn't account for the income you'll receive from Social Security or the fact that you'll no longer have401(k)or IRA contributions in retirement.Therefore, you may consider saving less than that amount, as your spending may decline in retirement. You can also useretirement savings tables onlineto help you figure out if you're on track to retire based on your age and income. At the end of the day, these are just general guidelines, so make sure to personalize them. After you've taken stock of your finances, there are many ways to try to fund the gap in your retirement savings. \"People can work part-time, they can downsize, they can relocate, they can have children move-in and share rent, mortgage, and other expenses. There are so manycreative ways to get to retirementthat you love,\" said Gucciardi. If you're still able to work, consider extending your career a bit longer\u2014this gives you extra time to build up your savings, a shorter retirement to fund, and possibly the ability to delay collectingSocial Security benefits. And for those who are unable to continue to work full-time or in-person, there are some types ofgig work\u2014like freelance writing or tutoring\u2014can be done entirely from home, offering retirees flexibility and the opportunity to create their own schedules. Those who continue to work can put additional money towards retirement. For IRAs, individuals age 50 and over can make contributions worth up to $8,000 for 2025. (The IRA andcatch-up contributionlimits are $7,000 and $1,000, respectively.) Additionally, if you have a workplace retirement plan and are age 50 or older, you may be eligible to make catch-up contributions worth up to $7,500 for 2025. The total annual contribution limit, including the catch-up for 401(k)s is $31,000. Plus, underSECURE 2.0, a federal retirement law, workers aged 60, 61, 62, and 63 are now able to make larger catch-up contributions, up to $11,250 in 2025. If you own a home, you may not consider your home equity when evaluating your retirement nest egg. However, some retirees may be able to free up extra funds by selling their home anddownsizingor moving to a lower-cost-of-living area in retirement. One Vanguard study found that 60% of retirees who move end up in an area with a cheaper housing market. By moving to a location with amore affordable housing market, retirees unlocked a median home equity of approximately $100,000. Note that this may not be practical option for everyone, especially for those who currently live in a low cost of living area but plan to move to more expensive region. Gucciardi also notes that retirees shouldn't solely relocate based on cost, but should take a more holistic approach to their decision. \"When I have clients who say they are going to move or relocate to a low-cost area, I drill down and ask them: Who is going to take them to appointments? Are they moving someplace where they have a community?\" said Gucciardi. \"At some point, you will need more help and need a network.\" By delayingSocial Security, retirees can earn extra money to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of retirement, yet delaying might not be the right choice for everyone. When choosing when to start collecting benefits, carefully weigh factors such as your health status, family medical history, whether you have a spouse who will collect on your record, life expectancy, and if you have additional retirement funds to rely on if you choose to delay. Waiting to collect pastfull retirement age (FRA)\u2014which is age 67 for retirees born in 1960 or later\u2014results in an 8% annual boost in benefits up to age 70.That means retirees can earn up to 124% of their benefit by delaying. For example, if your monthly benefit is $2,000 at age 67, it would be $2,480 if you waited until age 70. That would be an additional $5,760 a year. Yet waiting past FRA may not be the best strategy for everyone. In a 2024 Morningstar study, researchers found that waiting until age 70 is often a better strategy for individuals who don't need money immediately, are healthy, and, if they're no longer working, have other funds and retirement accounts they can tap while they wait until age 70 to collect. Retiring with limited savings isn\u2019t easy, but it is doable with the right planning. Start by understanding your current finances and consider creative ways to fill the gap, like part-time work, putting extra money into your 401(k) or IRA, or tapping home equity. You'll also want to be deliberate about when you collect Social Security benefits\u2013delaying benefits can pay off, but it may not be the right option if you're in poor health or urgently need money.",

        "header": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Go Parabolic in June (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "After an incredible two-year run on the stock market, big tech hasn't fared quite so well in 2025. Among the biggest laggards in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks isTesla(TSLA1.93%), whose shares have declined 15% year to date (as of May 15). While this sell-off makes Tesla one of the poorest performers among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, that may soon change. Let's explore why June is going to be such a pivotal month for Tesla's future. And more importantly, I'll take a look at more recent trends surrounding Tesla stock to help assess whether now is a good time to pounce on shares before they potentially go parabolic in a few weeks. Tesla derives the majority of its revenue and profits from selling electric vehicles (EVs). Unfortunately,Tesla's EV business has hit a road bump, and growth has stalled. While most management teams wouldn't be thrilled by these dynamics, Tesla CEO Elon Musk seems quite confident in the direction the company is headed. The reason? Musk's vision isn't just for Tesla to sell EVs. Rather, he has his sights set on building anautonomous vehiclefleet to ferry passengers around -- an ambition known as Robotaxi. Per Tesla's first-quarter earnings call, Musk is committed tolaunching the first Robotaxi rides next monthin Austin, Texas. Image source: Getty Images. Robotaxi has been one of the pillars supporting the bull thesis around Tesla stock for years. Now, it seems like the company has finally built enough vehicles to launch its first paid service and compete with other ridehailing businesses such asUber,Lyft, andWaymo. As an investor in Tesla myself, I am really excited about the Robotaxi launch. However, this is not the first time Tesla has hyped up a new product, and I know that remaining grounded right now is the prudent strategy because Tesla does have a history of missing deadlines. While the company often follows through on its ambitions, it's not always according to Musk's stated timeline. Since acore part of the AI thesis around Teslais rooted in the Robotaxi business being successful, any delay in the launch is a red flag. Let's be optimistic here and say Tesla does pull off the launch next month. While that's exciting, investors need to be realistic. It's going to take time for Robotaxi to scale and acquire customers. This is precisely why Musk signaled to investors that \"the real question from [a] financial standpoint is when does it really become material and affect [the] bottom line of the company.\" According to him, Robotaxi will begin to \"move the financial needle\" toward the middle of next year. The fact that Robotaxi will initially be an immaterial contributor to Tesla from a financial standpoint is important. As is often the case with Tesla stock, shares experience fleeting volatility based on narratives -- both positive and negative. If Tesla does indeed launch Robotaxi next month in Austin, my hunch is that shares will skyrocket. In fact, the chart below shows that Tesla stock has been creeping up as of late -- and there's no clear reason.  Data byYCharts. Sure,positive developments around tariff negotiationsare likely playing a role in Tesla's recent gains (along with those of the broad market overall). But there is still little clarity around how these negotiations are affecting Tesla's business specifically. At least with Robotaxi, Musk has already warned investors not to put too much weight on the early results, indicating that it will take time for the business to scale and become a meaningful new source of sales and profits. That said, expectations remain high, and if the Robotaxi launch is delayed or flops, Tesla stock could plummet. For these reasons, I suggest sitting on the sidelines regarding an investment in Tesla right now. Austin is only one market for Robotaxi, which is expected to become a global operation over time. If Robotaxi does prove to be a lucrative extension of Tesla's EV business, investors will have ample opportunities to invest in the stock as the business evolves into more of an AI player than a car manufacturer.",

        "content": "Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company recently published a report detailing compelling trends in research and development (R&D) and capital expenditure (capex) related to artificial intelligence (AI) investments over the next five years. Per McKinsey's analysis, spending on AI infrastructure could reach $6.7 trillion by 2030. Among these different infrastructure opportunities, McKinsey estimates that nearly $3.1 trillion will be allocated toward chip designers for AI-equipped data centers. Let's analyze which companies are making major investments in AI infrastructure right now and explore what they're investing in. From there, I'll reveal my top four data center stocks to load up on right now and explain why. Investors don't need to look much further than the \"Magnificent Seven\" to buy into McKinsey's forecast around rising AI-related capex. For the last couple of years,Microsoft,Alphabet, andAmazonhave been shelling out billions, partnering with high-profile businesses such as OpenAI (maker of ChatGPT) andAnthropic.  Data byYCharts. Integratinglarge language models(LLMs) and generative AI into their respective ecosystems has supercharged growth for megacap tech -- especially in areas such as cybersecurity, workplace productivity software, and cloud computing infrastructure. Just this year alone, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are forecast tospend nearly $260 billion on capex. Per the commentary of their respective management teams, much of this spend will be allocated toward chips and outfitting AI data centers -- just as McKinsey is calling for. In addition to the cloud hyperscalers above,Meta Platformsrecently told investors that it is actually raising its capex budget for 2025. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, Meta has proven to be a big buyer of chips over these last few years. Additionally, each of these Magnificent Seven members has also been exploring their own custom silicon. With this backdrop, here are four companies that stand to benefit from these AI infrastructure tailwinds. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to AI chip designers, my top two picks areNvidia(NVDA0.28%)andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.91%). Per industry estimates, Nvidia is estimated to hold 90% (or more) of the AI GPU market with AMD comprising much of the remainder. Considering each company I referenced above currentlyruns on both Nvidia and AMD chip architecture, the capex spend for this year should be a major tailwind for both chip stocks. Moreover,Broadcom(AVGO-1.76%)stands to benefit from rising AI infrastructure spend in a couple of ways. First, the company specializes in outfitting data centers with networking equipment needed to house GPU clusters. Broadcom can also lend a hand in the area of custom silicon (which it's currently doing already with Meta). Lastly, and perhaps the most lucrative opportunity of all, isTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.13%). Taiwan Semi specializes in the fabrication processes needed to actually make the chips designed by Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and more. Among Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and TSMC, each company plays a mission-critical role in the development of AI-powered services. Given the spending patterns from AI's biggest players appear to be very much still in motion, all four of these semiconductor stocks are well positioned for accelerated growth for years to come. The chart below illustrates theforward price-to-earnings(P/E) multiples for Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, and TSMC.  Data byYCharts. There has been a considerable drop in the forward P/E ratios for these companies in recent months. Much of this valuation compression has to do with uncertainty around President Trump's new tariff policies. While some progress appears to have been made, it's still a fluid situation. In my eyes, many investors are sitting on the sidelines right now -- waiting to see what management teams at these companies have to say in terms offinancial guidanceover the next quarter or second half of the year. As a long-term investor, I'm not overly concerned about what the next couple of quarters may look like. Rather, I'm more keyed into the secular themes fueling AI growth right now. As McKinsey models in its reporting, spending on AI infrastructure -- particularly chips and data centers -- should continue to experience robust growth over the next several years. For these reasons, I would take advantage of any weakness among these chip stocks and prepare to hold on tight.",

        "content": "The U.S. equity market has been challenging for investors in 2025, weighed down by inflation, geopolitical tensions, and rising interest rates. Investors have also been concerned about the escalation of trade wars in an already uncertain macroeconomic environment. However, such periods of high turbulence also offer astute investors a rare opportunity to pick up shares in attractive stocks that are trading at reasonable valuation levels. Image source: Getty Images. You do not need boatloads of capital to take advantage of this situation. All you need is $1,000 that is not required to pay bills or for contingencies. Here's why investors can consider investing $1,000 in each of these stocks now. Semiconductor giantNvidia's(NVDA0.28%)unrivaled 92% share in the $125 billion data center GPU market has positioned it as a dominant player in the rapidly evolvingartificial intelligence(AI) market. Cloud service providers, regional cloud providers, and enterprises are increasingly adopting the company's GPUs to build their AI infrastructure. Furthermore, Nvidia's recently launched Blackwell architecture chips are already showing strong momentum, with revenue of $11 billion recorded in the recent quarter. Blackwell systems, which are optimized for inferencing (real-time deployment) workloads, process reasoning workloads -- another type of inferencing workload -- at 25 times the speed and 20 times the cost efficiency of the previous generation Hopper 100 chips. Hence, Blackwell stands to benefit significantly from the increasing demand for recurring inferencing workloads across industries. In addition to building a solid moat in AI hardware, Nvidia has also developed a comprehensive software ecosystem. This particularly includes Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), a parallel computing platform, used to optimally program Nvidia's GPUs. While Nvidia's stock price has been quite volatile in 2025, falling nearly 35% from its high in early January to its recent low in April, it has since increased by almost 39% to $135.29 (as of May 14). The surge in share price was driven by the company's strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia, which will provide several hundred thousand of its advanced GPUs over the next five years. The company has also demonstrated significant adaptability in response to the export controls for the Chinese market by developing compliant chips. Investor sentiment also improved after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have agreed to a 90-day pause on tariffs, which will result in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% (instead of 145%) and Chinese duties on U.S. imports at 10% (instead of 125%). The U.S. government has also revoked the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, which would have restricted chip exports to 120 countries, starting May 15, 2025. Despite the many tailwinds, Nvidia is trading at 25.4 timesforward earnings, which is lower than its five-year average of 69.2 times. Hence, given its solid fundamentals and reasonable valuation, Nvidia may soar higher, especially after its first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings results (scheduled for May 28). Amazon(AMZN0.18%)reported strong first-quarter 2025 results, with revenue rising 9% year over year to $155.7 billion and operating income climbing 20% year over year to $18.4 billion. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is indisputably a significant growth catalyst for Amazon. The AWS cloud computing business reached an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. With more than 85% of global IT spending still allocated to on-premise infrastructure, AWS stands to benefit from the expected shift in spending toward the cloud over the next 10 to 20 years. Amazon's AI initiatives are also helping build new revenue streams. The company's AI business has already reached a \"multibillion dollar annual revenue run rate,\" according to CEO Andy Jassy, and is growing at triple-digit percentages year over year. Amazon is focused on developing a complete AI stack, including custom chips, foundational models, and AI applications. The company's custom Trainium 2 chips offer 30% to 40% better price performance than competitors, leading to significant demand from enterprises keen on controlling costs for large AI workloads. Amazon also offers a wide range of high-performing foundational models from other AI providers, as well as its own Amazon Nova state-of-the-art foundation models through the fully managed Bedrock service, enabling customers to build their own generative AI applications. Finally, Amazon is also developing AI-powered agents capable of performing complex, multistep tasks. Advertising is another understated catalyst for Amazon. Thanks to its broad customer reach and robust e-commerce platform, the company can effectively engage with its customers across multiple stages of the purchase journey. The company offers advertisers tools to reach targeted audiences across its entertainment properties, in live sports, audio content, and its e-commerce platform, as well as on external sites such asBuzzFeedandPinterest. Amazon's retail operations are also benefiting from a rearchitected inbound network, driving better inventory placement, higher units per package, and lower delivery costs. The company is also working on other initiatives, such as expanding its same-day delivery sites and rural delivery network, as well as introducing robotics and automation to its facilities. Finally, Amazon is also banking on its ambitious satellite internet initiative, Project Kuiper, to become a significant revenue catalyst. With recent successful satellite launches and two more expected through 2025, Kuiper positions Amazon to capture a substantial share of the satellite internet market estimated to be worth $108 billion by 2035. Despite its strong fundamentals and multiple tailwinds, Amazon trades at approximately 28.6 times forward earnings, which is well below the five-year average of 53.6 times. Hence, it looks like a fantastic long-term buy now.",

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang is set to open the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Monday, where he is expected to discuss the company's advancements inartificial intelligenceserver systems, cloud computing products and robotics. Huang's 90-minute presentation will start at 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) at the Taipei Music Hall. Once primarily focused on the PC industry, the Santa Clara, California-based company has used its presence at Computex to launch new graphics cards forvideo games. Earlier this year, Nvidia unveiled a new line of graphics chips at the CES show in Las Vegas. But Nvidia has grown beyond its roots as a video game graphics chip maker into the dominant producer of chips that have powered the AI frenzy that has gripped the tech industry since ChatGPT's launch in 2022. Nvidia has been designing central processing units (CPUs) that would runMicrosoft's Windows operating system and use technology from Arm Holdings, Reuters has previously reported. At Computex last year, Huang sparked \"Jensanity\" in Taiwan, as the public and media breathlessly followed the CEO, who was mobbed by attendees at the trade show. During the company's annual developer conference in March, Huang outlined how Nvidia would position itself to address the shift in computing needs from building large AI models to running applications based on them. In a more than two-hour speech, Huang unveiled several new generations of AI chips, including the Blackwell Ultra, which will be available later this year. The company's Rubin chips will be followed by Feynman processors, which are set to arrive in 2028. Nvidia also launched a desktop version of its AI chips, called DGX Spark, targeting AI researchers. Computex, which will run from May 20 to 23, is expected to have 1,400 exhibitors. It will be the first major gathering of computer and chip executives in Asia since U.S.President Donald Trumpthreatened to impose sweeping tariffs to push companies to increase production in the U.S. (Reporting by Max A. Cherney in Taipei; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

        "content": "Stocks have bounced back after escalating tariffs and rising geopolitical concerns have given way to hope for a more stable global trade environment. Technology names were some of the hardest hit with the tech-heavyNasdaq Compositefalling as much as 24% from recent highs. Sector-specific concerns also hurt recent winners like artificial intelligence (AI) leaderNvidia(NVDA0.28%)and AI server providerDell Technologies(DELL3.08%). The fears about declining investments to build AI infrastructure may have been premature, though. The result could be a surge in stocks like Nvidia, Dell, and another under-the-radar AI play as the year progresses. Image source: Nvidia. Optimism is spreading as President Donald Trump has already rolled back some tariffs previously announced, including slashing tariffs on China from 145% to 30% for at least a 90-day negotiating period. That optimism should help companies continue to commit capital to build AI infrastructure. Some big tech names have already said they expect to maintain or even grow investments this year. One insider who believes data center usage will continue to grow isBlackstonepresident and chief operating officer Jonathan Gray. That private equity company has a unique perspective as it invests in a diverse range of technology companies. Gray stated: \"I think this trend is powerful. I think it will continue,\" commenting ondata center investmentsin a recent CNBC interview. He added that, \"overall, we still see a ton of demand.\" Much of that demand is for Nvidia's advanced chips and AI software stacks. That view was reinforced when Nvidia announced a new major customer in Saudi Arabia. Humain, a newly launched Saudi Arabian AI company owned by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, plans to buy 18,000 of Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips along with Nvidia networking and the Omniverse cloud platform. That's just the first phase of a projected 500 megawatt-capacity data center powered by hundreds of thousands of NvidiaGPUsover the next five years. That's just the latest example of Nvidia's long runway for growth. Orders such as that will also boost the future earnings of server providers like Dell Technologies. Dell isn't a pure AI play as it also sells personal computers, traditional servers, and provides a wide variety of technology products and services. Its growth driver, though, is from its AI-optimized server shipments. Those sales exploded to $2.1 billion in the latest quarter from $800 million in the year-ago period. Dell said it had a $4.1 billion AI backlog exiting the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. Dell is also returning capital to shareholders. It boosted its annual dividend by 18% in fiscal 2025 after a 20% increase in 2024. The current dividend representsa forward yieldof nearly 2%, even after Dell shares have soared by more than 50% since early April. Its next quarterly earnings report is due on May 29, and investors might hear enough of an optimistic forecast from management to set the stock up for more gains in the back half of 2025. CuriosityStream(CURI8.09%)isn't as well known to investors. As of this writing, it is stilla small-cap companywith a market capitalization of about $320 million. Investors might wonder how a media and entertainment company like CuriosityStream could be an AI stock. The company was founded by John Hendricks, who also created and ledThe Discovery Channel's parent. CuriosityStream's mission is similar to that more well-known documentary cable channel: \"To satisfy humanity's enduring curiosity about our world with premium factual content that informs, enchants, and inspires.\" Yet it has a catalog of factual content that is not just desired by consumers for entertainment, but also in high demand for AIlarge language model (LLM) training. The licensing revenue for CuriosityStream's content is now the growth story. Revenue growth prospects were good enough for management to initiate a dividend last year. It has since raised that payout several times and announced a one-time special dividend after reporting its first net profit in the first quarter. The balance sheet had $39 million in cash and equivalents along with no debt as of March 31, allowing CuriosityStream to deliver excess cash back to shareholders. Management sees revenue continuing to increase in the second quarter with the midpoint of guidance implying 33% year-over-year growth.Adjusted free cash flowshould also keep rising, allowing it to continue sharing leftover cash after investing in the business with shareholders. Itsforward dividend yieldwas a healthy 5.7% at its recent price of $5.62 per share, not including the one-time payout coming in June. Each of these three stocks is benefiting greatly from rising AI spending. Nvidia may be the least risky of the three with so much business seemingly locked in for months and years to come. Investors have more recently caught on to CuriosityStream's story. Shares have doubled in just the last month. Some of its AI-related gains are already built in. But morerisk-tolerant investorsmight still see it as an intriguing growth story as it should report increasing licensing revenue growth through the back half of the year.",
