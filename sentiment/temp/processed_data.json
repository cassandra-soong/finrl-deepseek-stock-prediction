        "header": "Should You Buy Nvidia Before May 28?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.01%)soared over the past two years, but in recent weeks, it's offered investors a fresh buying opportunity that some may have never believed possible. After all, the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant's earnings have been climbing, and the AI market is set to reach into the trillions by the end of the decade. And all of this should support more gains for Nvidia's stock price. But general concerns about the economy, spurred by President Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports, weighed on Nvidia -- and the overall stock market. Investors also worried about export restrictions that recently halted Nvidia's sales of chips to China. As a result, Nvidia stock fell as much as 29% from the start of the year through its lowest point last month. It's since started to rebound but still remains at a very reasonable price in relation to forward earnings estimates. Now, investors are wondering how long it might stay at that price -- especially with a big potential catalyst coming up on May 28. I'm talking about Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, a moment that generally offers us important updates and a glimpse into what's ahead for this industry mover and shaker. This is particularly important these days, as concern remains about the impact of potential tariffs on electronics and on the future of chip exports. Should you buy Nvidia before this key date? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. It's important to note that Nvidia has wowed investors quarter after quarter with its earnings growth and product updates and plans. The company has reported double- or triple-digit revenue growth, and that revenue has each time reached new records. At the same time, profitability on sales has been fantastic, withgross marginconsistently above 70%. And even during the costly time of a product launch -- I'm talking about the recent release of the Blackwell architecture and chip -- Nvidia has managed to maintain gross margin above that level. Meanwhile, the company marches forward with its emphasis on innovation, outlining its plans to release chip and/or full architecture updates on an annual basis. Blackwell Ultra will arrive in the second half of this year, followed by the Vera Rubin architecture in the second half of next year. This should keep Nvidia in its leadership position inthe AI market. Finally, in recent weeks, Nvidia has demonstrated its ability to manage challenges such as tariffs or export restrictions to China. For example, to minimize impact of potential tariffs on electronics products, Nvidia announced a major investment in manufacturing in the U.S. The company's goal is to fully produce AI supercomputers in the U.S. -- today, most manufacturing happens in Taiwan, so this represents a major shift. As for the China situation, Nvidia is looking to build a research and development center in Shanghai, according to aFinancial Timesreport. The idea would be to develop designs to suit the needs of Chinese customers while respecting the stringent requirements of U.S. export controls, according to the newspaper. So, Nvidia is showing itself to be proactive and resourceful when faced with challenges. Now, what should you expect on May 28? Nvidia has a long track record of beating analysts' expectations, and in the recent earnings report the launch of Blackwell was going strong -- with the product generating $11 billion in revenue during its first quarter on the market. Investors already know that Nvidia will be taking a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. further restrictedexports to China-- so that specific element shouldn't perturb sentiment. Still, in spite of Nvidia's moves to manage the export and tariff issues, these risks do remain and could weigh on stock performance at any moment. And any setbacks in the tariff agreement process between the U.S. and China or the U.S. and other countries as well as any weaker-than-expected economic data represent potential headwinds for the stock. Nvidia depends heavily on the financial health of other big tech giants and their ability to spend on AI infrastructure. Considering all of this, should you buy Nvidia before May 28? Nvidia is trading for 30 timesforward earnings estimates, higher than it was a few weeks ago. But it's still much lower than its peak last year and this year, making it very reasonably priced today.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts It's possible that positive earnings news will lift the stock and valuation, but I wouldn't expect a dramatic move in valuation that would immediately push it into overvalued territory. And though potential risks to near-term growth exist, as mentioned, in my opinion, Nvidia's positive long-term prospects are far stronger. So, Nvidia is a buy, but whether you make the move today or after May 28 it won't make a huge difference for your eventual returns -- if you invest for the long term. That's because this hot stock may get even hotter as the AI story enters its next chapters, meaning that even if it stagnates or falls at a certain point, over time, Nvidia stock could offer your portfolio a significant boost.",

        "header": "6 Billion Reasons To Buy This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Semiconductor Stock Hand Over Fist (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "When it comes to the semiconductor industry, chances are the top name that comes to mind isNvidia. For the last two years, investors have been consistently reminded of just how dominant Nvidia's presence is in the world of high-performance chipsets, known as graphics processing units (GPUs). WhileAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-2.12%)has started to build respectable momentum in the GPU world, the company largely remains in Nvidia's shadow. Unsurprisingly, AMD stock hasn't experienced anywhere near the same level of enthusiasm compared to Nvidia during the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. That might change sooner rather than later, however. Let's explore an important announcement investors may have missed from AMD, and assess why now could be a great opportunity to buy the stock. On May 14, AMD announced that its board of directors approved a $6 billionshare repurchase program. This is in addition to AMD's existing $4 billion buyback authorization, bringing the total amount to $10 billion.  Data byYCharts. Over the last year, AMD stock has fallen roughly 30%, and in that time, you can see the company has been ramping up its buyback activity. I'll explain why these dynamics are important. AMD's financial profile can be hard to decipher at first glance. During the first quarter, AMD generated $7.4 billion in revenue -- up 36% year over year. While that looks solid, there's more than meets the eye here. AMD has been experiencing deceleration across its gaming and embedded segments for quite a while now, and Q1 was no exception. Nevertheless, growth from the company's data center and client segments contributed enough to make up for the other business units. The data center business currently makes up about half of AMD's total revenue while boasting a higher operating margin than the client and gaming segment. While these trends are encouraging, AMD's share price action suggests that investors are either uninspired or have their doubts over AMD's ability to compete with Nvidia. WhileNvidia had a first-mover advantagewhen it comes to data center GPUs, AMD's pace of innovation should not be glossed over. Over the last year, AMD has managed to attract a number of existing Nvidia customers such asOracle,Microsoft, andMeta Platforms-- each of whom have become adopters of AMD's MI300 accelerators. I think AMD's ongoing buybacks and the new $6 billion repurchase program signal that management sees investors aren't giving the company much credit for itsAI chip business. At the same time, this segment of AMD's business is still in its early stages and has yet to scale. For this reason, management sees AMD shares as undervalued -- hence, the company has been buying back stock. Image source: Getty Images. While AMD'sforward price-to-earnings(P/E) multiple may not appear cheap, the downward trend signals clear valuation compression that's hard to overlook.  Data byYCharts. The timing of the new repurchase authorization is key. AMD is scheduled to launch a line of new GPU architectures later this year. The company's decision to increase its buybacks now could also signal that management is confident in the long-rundemand prospects of this new launch, making the stock a good value at current levels. As successor chip architectures continue to be released and AMD attracts more customers, the data center business should extend its lead as the biggest contributor of sales and profits for the company. AMD stock is down nearly 50% from its all-time high, and\u00a0investors with a long-run time horizon should scoop up shares, while they still trade at this reasonable price point. Management appears to have high conviction in the company's growth prospects.",

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares fell on Monday, a sluggish start to the week for a stock that had posted gains in each of the previous four weeks. The downturn to start this week came as technology conglomerateXiaomi announced that its new electric YU7 SUVwill launch in China on Thursday, likely challenging Tesla\u2019s popularModel Yfor market share in the competitive mid-size electric SUV category. During theirfour-week winning run, Tesla shares gained 45%.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 The Chinese government accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva after it warned that using Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s artificial-intelligence chips \u201canywhere in the world\u201d would violate US export controls. Most Read from Bloomberg America, \u2018Nation of Porches\u2019 NJ Transit Train Engineers Strike, Disrupting Travel to NYC NJ Transit Makes Deal With Engineers, Ending Three-Day Strike NYC Commuters Brace for Chaos as NJ Transit Strike Looms The Commerce Department said in a statement last week that it was issuing guidance to make clear the use of Huawei Ascend chips is a breach of the US government\u2019s export controls. The agency said it would also warn the public about \u201cthe potential consequences of allowing US AI chips to be used for training and inference of Chinese AI models.\u201d The US Commerce Department\u2019s has since changed its wording to say the agency was issuing guidance about \u201cthe risks of using PRC advanced computing ICs, including specific Huawei Ascend chips,\u201d stripping the \u201canywhere in the world\u201d reference. The formal Commerce guidance, dated May 13, says using Huawei\u2019s Ascend chips \u201crisks\u201d violating export controls. Those updates weren\u2019t enough to appease Beijing, which said Monday it had \u201cnegotiated and communicated with the US at all levels through the China-US economic and trade consultation mechanism, pointing out that the US\u2019s actions seriously undermined the consensus reached at the high-level talks between China and the US in Geneva.\u201d While Chinese authorities noted the US had \u201cadjusted\u201d the wording of its guidelines around Huawei chips, it maintained it was still a \u201cdiscriminatory measures\u201d and demanded that the US \u201ccorrect its mistakes.\u201d Tensions over Huawei\u2019s next-generation of chips underscores how fragile relations remain between the US and China, even after they reached a tariff truce this month in Switzerland. That arrangement lowers punitive levies for 90 days, opening a short window to strike a broader deal that both rebalances trade and protects Beijing\u2019s interests. China\u2019s chief trade negotiator Li Chenggang attacked export controls on AI-related chips at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting last week in South Korea, saying a certain country was over-stretching the idea of national security, according to an official who attended the session. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer responded it was a measure to protect domestic manufacturing capabilities, the official said. Li and Greer met at the event but neither side has disclosed what was discussed. Spokespeople for the US Commerce Department, the White House and China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Talks between the world\u2019s largest economies have resumed, but President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping still haven\u2019t spoken since the Republican returned to office, with Beijing preferring for negotiations to play out at a lower level. There are no public plans for the next round of trade talks. While officials could next cross paths in July at a Group of 20 meeting in South Africa, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent skipped a similar huddle earlier this year \u2014 although the two sides could arrange ad hoc talks in another neutral location. Despite rolling back a set of Biden administration-era regulations on AI chip exports to much of the world, the Trump administration has made clear it will continue to drive efforts to keep advanced technologies away from China. One source of leverage for China in pressing the US to ease such controls is its dominance in critical minerals. Removal of barriers Beijing placed on rare earths was a key concern for the US going into the talks in Geneva, Bloomberg News earlier reported. Rare earth exports fell 19% after those curbs, threatening the global supply of key materials used widely in high-tech manufacturing from electric vehicles to weaponry. The US guidance last week stood to make it all the more difficult for Shenzhen-based Huawei to fulfill its ambitions of developing more powerful semiconductors for AI and smartphones, efforts that have already hit major roadblocks because of US sanctions. Huawei has emerged as China\u2019s national technology champion since its breakthrough in processors for the Mate 60 Pro in 2023 \u2014 a milestone it reached despite then-punishing US sanctions. The company has since expanded into adjacent arenas from EVs to AI, where it\u2019s begun making chips it hopes can compete with Nvidia Corp. (NVDA). Huawei\u2019s Ascend lineup is thought to be so far largely confined to use in China by Chinese firms that have otherwise limited access to Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge products. But they\u2019ve been making headway in the market because of US restrictions, and have proven capable particularly in inferencing or supporting AI services, according to industry experts. \u2014With assistance from Catherine Lucey, James Mayger and Soo-Hyang Choi.

        "content": "For some investors, earnings season is the most-exciting period of each quarter. Over a span of six weeks, Wall Street's most-influential businesses lift their proverbial hoods and give investors an inside look at what's going on. But it can be argued that the release ofForm 13Fsby financial institutions is even more telling of Wall Street's innerworkings. No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides investors with an over-the-shoulder view of what Wall Street's premier money managers were up to during the previous quarter (the first quarter, in this instance). It offers a concise snapshot of all buying and selling activity, which helps investors figure out which stocks and trends are piquing the interest of the market's most-successful asset managers. Image source: Getty Images. ThoughWarren Buffett is the most-followed of all asset managers, he's far from the only billionaire money manager that investors keep close tabs on. Another closely tracked billionaire fund manager that garners plenty of attention is Tiger Global Management's Chase Coleman, who ended March 2025 overseeing almost $26.6 billion in AUM. The reason Coleman draws so much interest is because he's a growth-seeking investor at heart. You'll find a number of high-growth tech stocks, along withartificial intelligence (AI)companies, among his funds' 45 holdings. What stands about the Tiger Global's latest 13F is that Coleman added to his stake in AI colossusNvidia(NVDA-1.18%)for the first time in more than a year, while simultaneously kicking two other high-performing AI stocks to the curb. Accounting forNvidia's historic 10-for-1 forward stock split in June 2024, Tiger Global Management closed out 2023 with 9,683,550 shares of Wall Street's AI darling. It ended 2024 with the exact same number of shares. But during a tumultuous first quarter for tech stocks in 2025, billionaire Chase Coleman picked up an additional 1,284,000 shares of Nvidia (a roughly 13% increase). Arguably the top reason investors have piled into Nvidia since the start of 2023 is itsgraphics processing unit (GPU) market share dominancein AI-accelerated data centers. The company's Hopper (H100) and next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture account for the lion's share of the chips being used to power generative AI solutions and train large language models in high-compute data centers. On the surface, Nvidia's valuation has also become more palatable as it's been able to grow into its rapidly rising market cap. Based on consensus earnings per share (EPS) expectations for fiscal 2027 (Nvidia's fiscal year ends in late January), Nvidia is trading at 24 times forward-year earnings, as of the closing bell on May 16. But during tumultuous trading in March, Nvidia'sforward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratiodipped to approximately 19. To build on this point, Nvidia's nearly 30% peak-to-trough decline in the first quarter represents its steepest drop from an all-time high since the 2022 bear market. It may have been carrot that lured Coleman to take a bite. While there's no denying that Nvidia's returns have been special, there are also clear concerns about its future.Growing direct and internal competitionthreaten to gobble up precious AI data center real estate, which can further weigh down its gross margin. History hasn't been kind to next-big-thing investments, either. For more than 30 years, every game-changing innovation has worked its way through a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion phase. No company would be more directly hurt if the AI bubble bursts than Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. But while Chase Coleman was busy loading up shares of Nvidia for his fund, he was also sending two high-growth AI stocks to the chopping block. The first of these big-time AI stock sales is cloud-based observability and security platformDatadog(DDOG-1.08%). Tiger Global's 13F shows that all 979,400 shares, valued at nearly $140 million to end 2024, were dumped during the first quarter. Theallure of Datadog as an investment has been its outsized growth rate, which has consistently topped 20%, as well as its recurring profits. It was aparticularly popular name during the height of the COVID-19 pandemicgiven the observability aspect of its platform to oversee public and private clouds. In other words, it was one of the most ideally positioned work from home stocks. Datadog also benefited from landing bigger fish. Investors consistently rewarded the company with a premium valuation due to its ability to snag customers generating at least $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). Though bigger isn't always better, larger contracts for Datadog do have a tendency to lead to juicier margins. Chase Coleman sending Datadog to the doghouse likely has to do withits tempered 2025 growth outlook, as well as its valuation premium, relative to its outlook. When Datadog issued its 2025 full-year outlook in mid-February, it called for a midpoint of $3.185 billion in sales and $1.65 to $1.70 in adjusted EPS. For the sake of comparison, Wall Street's consensus had been for EPS of $2.04 and sales of around $3.24 billion. The cherry on top is that the reported 462 customers generating ARR of at least $1 million in 2024 -- a 17% year-over-year increase -- was below expectations, as well. While Datadog continues to grow rapidly, few (if any) mistakes will be tolerated for a company already valued at close to 13 times forecast sales and 69 times projected EPS in 2025. The second fast-paced AI stock billionaire Chase Coleman gave the heave-ho to is intellectual property (IP)-driven semiconductor companyArm Holdings(ARM-3.02%). Tiger Global Management closed out 2024 with 300,000 shares of Arm in its portfolio, but ended March with no shares remaining. Arm's claim to fame is itsvirtually insurmountable moat as a royalty and licensing company. Instead of directly producing and selling chips, Arm develops and designs GPUs, central processing units, and systems IP that other companies, like Nvidia, use when designing their own chips. With minimal recurring expenses, Arm can sit back and collect royalty and licensing fee revenue at an enviable margin. The great thing about Arm's operating model is that it's somewhat agnostic to economic downturns. With the AI revolution rapidly advancing, demand for more energy-efficient chips will keep Arm busy. Further, without any physical chip supply, Arm doesn't have to worry too much about the push-pull dynamics of oversupply and shortage that occurs in the semiconductor industry. So, why did Coleman shelve his fund's shares of Arm Holdings if the company is so perfectly positioned to benefit from its unique IP?The answer might lie with the stock costing an arm and a leg. As of this writing on May 16, a share of Arm is trading at a whopping 76 times forecast EPS for 2025, as well as trading at 30 times projected sales this year. Companies that can sustain moats absolutely deserve a valuation premium -- but 30 times projected 2025 sales is a tough pill to swallow. Historically, there hasn't been a company with a market cap north of $100 billion that's been able to sustain aprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof 30 or above for any significant length of time. We've witnessed market leaders of next-big-thing trends with P/S ratios of 30 or higher all eventually tumble. There's no reason to believe Arm will buck this trend.",

        "header": "5 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years",
        "content": "The professionals who manage Wall Street funds and cater to wealthy investors live and die by their quarterly performance. However, the individual investor can win the long game by focusing on what will matter the most years into the future. You can't look too far ahead, but there are already early signs of what could be the most impactful investing themes over the next decade. High-potential growth industries in their early innings includeartificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and genetic engineering, to name a few. As these opportunities play out, you'll want to consider owning these five monster stocks for the next decade. They carry some risk, but four have outperformed the market and could continue to do so, while the sole laggard might have the highest ceiling of the group. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA0.01%)is central to the AI revolution. The company's AI chips are the dominant hardware powering the vast data centers in which AI models train and operate. The company and stock have ridden an intense investment cycle across the technology sector to massive growth. Data center buildoutscontinue to show strength, and more intelligent AI will likely require continuous hardware upgrades to more advanced and efficient chips. Nvidia's opportunities don't necessarily end there. The company has created a hardware and software ecosystem for developing new technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Nvidia is also rolling out new form factors, including AI computers that can fit on a desk. Nvidia has cemented itself as a central force in AI innovation, and investors should ride that for the next decade. Cybersecurity has become mission-critical among enterprises, which potentially face millions of dollars in damages if there is a successful breach.CrowdStrike(CRWD1.13%)has become a juggernaut with its cloud-based Falcon Platform, which uses AI to deliver cutting-edge security performance. The company generated roughly $4 billion in highly profitable revenue last year, and continues to grow at a nearly 30% rate.  Data byYCharts. Last summer, CrowdStrike suffered embarrassment when a faulty update caused a massive outage onMicrosoftdevices. Despite the bad press and ruthlessly competitive dynamics in the security field, the incident has hada minimal impact on its business, which, if anything, shows just how sticky its security platform is. Investors will want to enjoy the ride as CrowdStrike grows its share of an addressable market that could increase to $250 billion by 2030. Google's parent company,Alphabet(GOOG0.20%)(GOOGL0.17%), has grown beyond its Google search engine to become a diverse technology behemoth. The appeal of Alphabet stock is that it has short-term and long-term growth opportunities. Today, digital ad revenue from Google Search and YouTube carries the water, while profits from cloud computing are soaring as that segment grows. That won't change overnight, and, looking further out, there are smaller businesses within Alphabet that could blossom and start making a difference. Alphabet is developingquantum computers, and its Waymo autonomous ride-hailing business is rapidly expanding. These two businesses could eventually help drive the company's next era of growth. The stock hasslipped due to regulatoryand competitive threats toward its search engine business, but this is morelikely a buying opportunitythat should pay off well over the next 10 years. Self-driving vehicles, robotics, and almost every new electronic technology require chips. That's why you may want to ownTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.44%), the world's leading chip foundry (commonly known as TSMC). The company's revenue share of the global foundry (chip production) market has increased from 58% in Q2 2023 to 67% in Q4 2024. Why? No company has the technology and capacity to produce large quantities of advanced chips like TSMC can.  Data byYCharts The global semiconductor market is poised to more than double to nearly $1.2 trillion by 2035, and TSMC should directly benefit. The company has some risk due to its proximity to China, which claims Taiwan as its territory. Still, TSMC's dominance and key role in the broader technology sector make it difficult to pass on. Thanks to CRISPR gene editing, healthcare is on the cusp of creating new treatments and even potential cures for conditions.CRISPR Therapeutics(CRSP-0.34%)is a leading player in the technology, which involves targeting and modifying specific genes within DNA. The company has just begun generating revenue on its first product, a joint venture withVertex Pharmaceuticals, and has a pipeline with several therapies in clinical trials. These therapies could treat certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and Type 1 diabetes. These are massive markets; any approval could be a game changer for a company worth just $3.3 billion today. However, these therapies could fail their trials and are still several years away from the market. Therefore, CRISPR Therapeutics is a high-risk, high-reward stock that has lagged the broader market, but coulddeliver life-changing returnsover the next decade if things work out.",

        "content": "Nine American companies are currently valued at $1 trillion or more, but only three of them graduated into the ultra-exclusive $3 trillion club: I thinkAmazon(AMZN0.18%)could join them before the end of 2026. The tech conglomerate operates the world's largest e-commerce and cloud computing platforms, and it's quickly cementing itself as a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, which is becoming a key source of growth. Amazon has a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion as of this writing, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a return of 36% over the next 18 months if it does join the $3 trillion club. Image source: Amazon. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers hundreds ofcloud computingsolutions to help businesses manage their digital operations, but it also became the engine of Amazon's AI strategy. AWS wants to dominate the three core layers of AI: hardware (data center infrastructure and chips),large language models(LLMs), and software (chatbotsand other AI applications). AWS builds centralized data centers and rents the computing capacity to AI developers for profit. It offers infrastructure fitted with Nvidia'sindustry-leading AI chips, but it also designed its own chips, which are substantially cheaper to use. In fact, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the new Trainium2 chip can save AI developers up to 40% on training costs compared to using competing chips. AWS also created its own family of LLMs called Nova, which developers can use to accelerate their AI software projects. It includes the new NovaSonic speech-to-speech model, which paves the way for conversational (voice-powered) AI applications. But the AWS Bedrock platform also offers access to leading third-party models from companies like Anthropic andMeta Platforms, so developers have multiple options, which ensures they have no reason to visit competing cloud platforms. Covering the third and final layer is an AI-powered virtual assistant called Q, which helps AWS customers analyze their internal data, and even develop software. Q has actually become the most capable AI coding assistant in the industry, maintaining the highest acceptance rate (fewest errors), and accelerating programming tasks by a whopping 80%. AWS generated $29.2 billion inrevenueduring the first quarter of 2025, which was a 17% increase from the year-ago period. It represented less than one-fifth of Amazon's total revenue of $155.6 billion; however, the cloud platform was responsible for 63% of the entire organization'soperating incomeof $18.4 billion. Cloud and AI services carry very high profit margins, but Amazon's largest source of revenue is still e-commerce, which carries verylowmargins. Offering products at the cheapest possible price is a cornerstone of Amazon's e-commerce strategy, so it has never been highly profitable. However, its operating income improved over the past year as the company restructured its fulfillment network to make it more efficient, which continues to drive down its cost per order. President Donald Trump's tariffscould undo some of that progress because Amazon and its third-party sellers will have to pass the added costs on to customers, or risk operating at a loss. According to Statista (citing Jungle Scout), more than 70% of the products sold on Amazon come from China, so they are currently subject to a 30% importtariff. The rate could come down after negotiations between the U.S. and China, but for now, it could be disruptive for Amazon's online sales. That means AWS will be an even greater point of focus for Wall Street in the coming quarters because it's the biggest contributor to Amazon's earnings, and its success will largely determine the valuation of Amazon stock. Thankfully, demand for data center capacity continues to outstrip supply, which should keep profit margins elevated. Plus, Jassy said AI revenue within AWS increased by a triple-digit percentage during Q1, and is now at a multibillion-dollar annual run rate, so it's likely to fuel the cloud platform's next phase of long-term growth. Amazon generated $1.59 inearnings per share(EPS) during the first quarter, which was an eye-popping 62% increase compared to the year-ago period. It takes the company's trailing-12-month EPS to $6.13, which places its stock at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 33.5. That means Amazon is cheaper than both Nvidia and Microsoft, and just higher than Apple:  PE Ratiodata byYCharts However, I would argue Amazon should be trading at apremiumvaluation right now. Its 62% EPS growth during Q1 crushedApple'sEPS growth of 8%, andMicrosoft'sgrowth of 18%. Plus, even Nvidia is forecast to grow its EPS by just 42% inits upcoming quarter, so Amazon's EPS might be increasing at a faster rate than every member of the $3 trillion club right now, which would normally translate into a higher P/E ratio. The average P/E ratio between Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple is 38. Let's assume for a moment that Amazon's P/E ratio rises to that level (it was there earlier this year, so it's not out of the question). Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate $7.27 in EPS during 2026, so a P/E ratio of 38 would equal a share price of $276.26. That would imply a market capitalization of around $2.95 trillion. But Amazon has beaten Wall Street's EPS estimates by an average of 22% over the last four quarters, so if that trend continues, the company's market cap would comfortably exceed $3 trillion by the end of next year.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has finalized a deal to divest the manufacturing segment of ZT Systems, selling it to Sanmina Corporation (NASDAQ:SANM) for $3 billion. The transaction, announced on May 19, includes $2.55 billion in cash and stock, along with up to $450 million in potential earnouts over the next three years. The move follows AMD\u2019s acquisition of ZT Systems last August for $4.6 billion. From the outset, the company signaled its intention to separate the low-margin manufacturing arm from the rest of the business. Instead, AMD aimed to retain ZT\u2019s engineering talent to bolster its position in the competitive data center GPU market. \u201cWe previously expected AMD to sell ZT Systems for closer to $5.0 billion or 1.0X TTM sales. While we would note that system manufacturing is a low-margin business, Supermicro trades at 1.2X TTM sales,\u201d Citi analysts said in a note. AMD is holding onto ZT\u2019s 1,200-person engineering team, which it effectively values at $1.6 billion\u2014or around $1.33 million per engineer. The team\u2019s experience in data center architecture and system deployment is seen as strategically important for AMD\u2019s efforts to narrow the gap with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Citi believes the acquisition could improve AMD\u2019s execution in the hyperscale data center space. \u201cWe believe the ZT Systems acquisition should allow AMD to better compete with Nvidia in the data center GPU market via additional system experience and faster hyperscaler deployment times,\u201d the bank wrote. Sanmina has agreed to acquire the manufacturing operations of ZT Systems for $2.25 billion in cash, along with an additional $300 million premium\u2014half in cash and half in equity.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) investing is somewhat affected by tariffs, as tariffs may be placed on components coming into the U.S. In addition, broader consumer demand may harm some of the cash flows that are being poured into AI investments. I've got a few stocks that will be fine over the long term, regardless of what happens with tariffs. These are excellent stocks to scoop up now and should be purchased with the mindset of holding for three to five years. Image source: Getty Images. Meta Platforms(META-0.05%)is an advertising company that earns most of its revenue (98%) from ads on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. It uses the enormous cash flows from its base business to heavily invest in AI, which allows it to innovate in the ad realm and develop new technologies. Tariffs may hurt Meta's primary business by causing some economic headwinds, which could affect advertising revenue streams. However, that will only be an initial shock, and while it could be a bumpy year or two, Meta's base business will be just fine over the next three to five years. Over that time frame, there will undoubtedly be impressive AI developments, likely including Meta's AI glasses, which could become an important part of the Meta investment thesis if they become a hit. Regardless, I think there's a strong enough case for the base business to purchase Meta shares right now, no matter what happens with tariffs. Meta is also fairly priced. Although it would have been better to buy it a few weeks ago when the markets bottomed, it's still priced at the lower end of where it has traded over the past year.  META PE Ratiodata byYCharts Even though the market roared back, I think Meta still makes a compelling enough long-term investment to take a position in the stock now. Nvidia(NVDA0.01%)may be a surprise addition to this list, as it sources many of its chips from outside the country. However, Nvidia announced that its next-generation Blackwell GPUs will be produced entirely in the U.S. by 2026. With chips originating fromTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's Arizona facility and then assembled in Foxconn and Wistron plants in Texas, these GPUs won't be subject to tariffs, because they're domestically produced. Nvidia's GPUs will still be in high demand over the next few years, as the AI hyperscalers are still working on building out their data center capacity. Furthermore, many GPUs originally purchased to train AI models will start to wear out, requiring Nvidia's customers to replace them. Third-party estimates pegged 2024 data center capital expenditures at $400 billion, but they're expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. This expansion will further bolster Nvidia's growth, making it a strong stock to buy (or at least continue holding). Like Meta's stock, Nvidia's dramatically recovered but is still below where it traded for most of 2024.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At31 times forward earnings, Nvidia isn't necessarily cheap, but the future looksbright enough for the company that it would be smart to scoop up shares now.",

        "content": "Although the members of the $1 trillion stock club can fluctuate from day to day, it's currently quite full, with 11 stocks being members of this exclusive club. Two of the latest members to join the club areTaiwan Semiconductor(TSM-0.44%)andBroadcom(AVGO0.75%), although they're not exactly new members. Both companies fell out of the $1 trillion valuation with the latest market dip, but have since regained entry to this group as of the time of writing. However, this is just the beginning for both stocks, as plenty of growth trends could push them even higher (maybe even into the $2 trillion range). Image source: Getty Images. Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures many of the chips that go into advanced technological devices. Whether it's an iPhone or anNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)GPU, TSMC makes the chips that go into these devices. While it has the best chip technology currently available (3-nanometer chips), it's slated to launch 2nm chips later this year and 1.6nm chips in 2026. The smaller the chip node, the more transistors it can pack onto a chip, which leads to more powerful designs. This continuous improvement culture is why many companies have chosen to partner with Taiwan Semi, and it is generally an irreplaceable supplier to its clients. Taiwan Semiconductor is also expected to grow massively over the next few years. Management projects AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years and overall growth to increase at nearly a 20% CAGR. If those assumptions come true, TSMC will be a must-own stock over the next five years. This projection also isn't a wild guess; there are real numbers to back it up. Many of TSMC's clients place chip orders years in advance, so the company often has an idea of what production looks like years out. For example, TSMC has already sold out its chip production capacity at its Arizona facility through 2027. So, this growth projection isn't far-fetched and could lead to significant outperformance by the stock. Taiwan Semi trades for 21 times forward earnings, which is a market-average multiple, meaning investors don't have to overpay to buy shares of TSMC stock.  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Although Taiwan Semi just joined the $1 trillion club, it's well on its way to potentially becoming a $2 trillion club member in under five years. If you've followed the AI space for any period, it's clear that Nvidia is an important company. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the computing muscle behind many AI models. However, GPUs are meant to be able to handle many types of workloads, so they aren't specialized to one particular task. Furthermore, Nvidia's GPUs are quite expensive, and they make massive profits from each one sold. This opens the door for a new type of computing unit, one designed and tailored for use by the end-user, which also cuts Nvidia out of the profit picture. Broadcom is a key player in the custom AI accelerator market, which it calls XPUs. XPUs are meant to run workloads configured in a particular manner to optimize performance. As a result, XPUs can outperform GPUs for AI training performance. Broadcom has partnered with several of the AI hyperscalers to help them design their XPUs, and three clients currently deploy these products. Broadcom estimates that the addressable market for these three will be between $60 billion and $90 billion by fiscal year 2027. Additionally, two other clients are slated to launch their XPUs by the end of this year, and two additional companies selected Broadcom as a partner to design their XPUs. Considering that XPUs and networking switches only produced $12.2 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2024, this could be a monster growth arm for Broadcom for years to come. However, you'll have to pay a premium to own Broadcom's stock, as it's not as cheap as it was just a month ago.  AVGO PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At35 times forward earnings, Broadcom's stock isn't the cheapest, but it reflects the growth the company is expected to deliver over the next few years. Broadcom should have a strong next few years, and if its XPU division grows like management expects, it could easily rise to a valuation of over $2 trillion.",

        "header": "3 Unstoppable Tech Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Growth stocks have dramatically outperformed most asset classes over the past two decades. Within that universe, large-cap tech leaders have delivered the lion's share of returns, riding tailwinds from the invention of the internet, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, a small cohort of tech giants has powered most of theS&P 500's gains in recent years. That trend isn't just likely to continue -- it may accelerate. Catalysts on the horizon include the long-awaited \"iPhone moment\" for robotics, the emergence ofartificial general intelligence(aka AGI), and the development of a commercially viable quantum computer. Image source: Getty Images. How can investors capture the upside from this wave of transformation? While index funds offer diversified exposure with less volatility, the biggest opportunities -- and risks -- lie in individual stocks. For those willing to think long term, here are three tech companies well positioned to ride the next tsunami of innovation. Amazon(AMZN0.18%)continues to evolve far beyond its e-commerce roots into a diversified technology juggernaut. While its retail business provides tremendous scale, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has become the company's profit engine, generating $11.5 billion in operating income in the first quarter of 2025 alone. This cloud-computing division maintains approximately 30% market share globally, positioning Amazon perfectly to capitalize on the explosive growth in AI workloads. CEO Andy Jassy recently highlighted that AI-related cloud services are growing at triple-digit rates as enterprises rush to deploy generative AI applications. Simultaneously, Amazon is transforming its massive fulfillment operations with over 750,000 robots that process orders 25% faster while reducing costs by a similar margin. This automation advantage is expected to yield $10 billion in annual savings by 2030, according toMorgan Stanleyanalysts. Looking further ahead, Amazon's early investments in quantum computing through its AWS Braket platform and proprietary \"cat qubit\" technology could prove transformative if the technology matures as expected. Despite these multiple growth vectors, Amazon trades at a reasonable 31.8 times forward earnings at the time of writing, offering investors an attractive entry point into one of tech's most diversified players. The stock's core risks revolve around the evolving tariff negotiations. Meta Platforms(META-0.05%)has staged an impressive comeback since its difficult stretch in 2022. Under CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company restructured aggressively, cutting costs, streamlining operations, and doubling down on AI initiatives. The result is a leaner, faster-moving Meta that dominates global social media. Meta's family of apps, consisting of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, now serves more than 3.4 billion daily active users, giving it unmatched reach for advertisers. That scale is translating into strong financials again. In Q1 2025, revenue jumped 16% year over year to $42.3 billion, driven by more effective ad targeting powered by AI-enhanced recommendation engines. While Reality Labs revenue declined 6% amid slower Quest headset sales, Meta remains committed to its metaverse ambitions. The company is also building one of the world's largest AI clusters, with 350,000Nvidia(NVDA0.01%)H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) deployed by the end of 2024 -- equivalent to 600,000 GPUs in compute power. Trading at around 23 times forward earnings as of this writing, Meta stock offers strong near-term cash-flow generation and long-term upside potential from its AI/immersive computing build-out. Its main risk factor centers around the popularity of its family of apps. Nvidia has emerged as the undisputed engine of the AI era, evolving from a graphics chip company into the foundational infrastructure provider for AI worldwide. Its dominance in AI accelerators is staggering, with most large-scale AI training workloads running on Nvidia'sgraphics processing unitarchitecture. Moreover, the widespread adoption of its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform has created a powerful lock-in effect, reinforcing its hardware lead. That dominance is reflected in the numbers. In Q4 of fiscal 2025, Nvidia posted $39.3 billion in revenue, a jaw-dropping 78% increase year over year. The surge was driven by its data center segment, which grew 93% to $35.6 billion relative to the same period a year ago. Gross margins stood at a healthy 73% in the quarter, fueled by insatiable demand for its high-performance AI chips. Despite its formidable competitive moat, several other companies are attempting to build competing ecosystems that could cut into the company's growth trajectory within a few years. That's a key risk factor investors will want to keep an eye on moving forward. But Nvidia isn't a one-trick pony. Under CEO Jensen Huang, the company is building a full-stack AI ecosystem that includes CUDA, enterprise-grade software, and its Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIM) -- a toolkit that allows developers to deploy optimized AI models across a range of cloud and edge environments. This platform-first strategy positions Nvidia as a component supplier and an end-to-end AI solution provider. While the stock trades around 31 times forward earnings, that premium looks reasonable in light of Nvidia's explosive earnings growth and its central role in powering the global AI transformation. As such, Nvida stock scans as a must-own for investors seeking the purest play on AI infrastructure in the broadest sense.",

A new downgraded chip is in the works as Nvidia seeks to retain footing in a critical growth market. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Revenue from China totaled $17 billion in the fiscal year ending January 26, 2025, representing 13% of Nvidia's total sales. The H20 chip was the only remaining product in the Hopper series legally permitted for export to China under U.S. rules. Huang confirmed in a livestream that no further Hopper updates are possible, stating, It's not Hopper because it's not possible to modify Hopper anymore, according to Taiwan's Formosa TV. The company is expected to release a downgraded H20 chip within two months, according to earlier reports from Reuters, to help regain lost market share from competitors like Huawei. The Biden administration's Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, issued in January 2025, imposed new export restrictions, which have been criticized by Huang. He argued that the U.S. should focus on maximizing the global reach of its technologies rather than restricting exports. President Donald Trump has pledged to revoke those rules, calling them counterproductive to U.S. interests in global tech leadership. Huang visited China shortly after the H20 restrictions took effect, signaling Nvidia's ongoing commitment to the region despite tightened rules. Seeinsidertrades for NVDA. ExplorePeter Lynch chart.

        "content": "The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1, and forecasters expect it to be unusually active. Colorado State University meteorologists forecast 17 named storms, including nine full-blown hurricanes, by the end of November.Now is a good time to get financially prepared. Put together this financial survival kit to help protect your money if a storm hits. Hurricanes can be daunting, but you can protect your finances by updating your insurance, making a detailed home inventory, gathering essential documents, stockpiling some cash, and knowing where to get help in advance. Homeowners insuranceusually covers hurricane-related wind damage to your home structure (via dwelling coverage) or personal belongings (via personal property coverage). It may also cover hotel, meals, and living expenses if you can\u2019t return home after a storm. However, you may have to meet a separatehurricane deductiblebefore coverage begins. It\u2019s important to understand your homeowners coverage, especially the type of policy you have and how much it will pay if your home is damaged. Coverage amounts depend on your policy type: Before hurricane season, carefully review your policy limits, coverage types, deductibles, and exclusions to ensure you have sufficient coverage. Don\u2019t wait until right before a storm, as most insurers issue moratoriums on new policies once a storm watch begins. \u201cWith the inflation we've seen over the last few years, it would be good to review your dwelling limit with your agent if you haven't done that recently,\u201d said Greg Martin, president of Think Safe Insurance in Brandon, Florida. \u201cConstruction prices change, and we've seen that some policy limits haven't kept up with the increased costs.\u201d Standard homeowners insurance excludes hurricane-related flood damage. Flood coverage requires a separate policy or endorsement. Mortgage lenders often require you to carryflood insurancewhen you live in a designated high-risk area. Still, coverage is worth considering, even if your home isn\u2019t in one of these zones. \u201cSo many non-flood zone homes were damaged and destroyed last year,\u201d said Stacy Miller, acertified financial planner (CFP)and founder of BayView Financial Planning in Tampa, Florida.\u00a0For instance, 78% of the properties affected by 2024\u2019s Hurricane Debby were outside a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood zone. You can purchase flood insurance from aprivate insureror the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). \u201cBe aware that there is a waiting period for most flood policies,\u201d Martin said. For NFIP plans, waiting periods are typically 30 days, while private flood insurance takes effect in 10 to 14 days. A home inventory is an extensive list of your personal property and each item\u2019s estimated value. It\u2019s a good idea to complete one ahead of hurricane season, \u201cso you have documentation if you have a claim,\u201d Martin said. Home inventories also help you assess how much insurance you need, and come in handy when trying to qualify for disaster aid or tax relief. A good home inventory includes video, receipts, purchase dates, purchase prices, makes/models, manufacturers, and serial numbers. FEMAsuggests that households prepare a portable emergency supply kit in case of evacuation. Recommended items include essential family and financial documents, such as \u201cinsurance policies, identification, and bank account records saved electronically or in a waterproof, portable container.\u201d Make digital copies of important records and store them in the cloud so you have access after an evacuation, said Jennifer Gambill, client advisor at World Insurance Associates in Miami. \u201cAfter a storm, keep in mind that law enforcement officials may restrict access to your neighborhood due to safety concerns, so you\u2019ll need to ensure that you have proof of household identification,\u201d Gambill said. Hurricanes often cause power outages, so \u201ckeep cash on hand for purchases\" in case electronic payment systems fail, said Casey Brueske, community education development specialist at PenAir Credit Union. FEMA recommends keeping cash in your emergency kit and limiting it to small bills ($1 through $20). That way, you won\u2019t have to worry about finding change during a disaster. Federal resources include: You can identify additional local resources, including open Red Cross shelters, on FEMA\u2019sdisaster assistance website. Hurricane season is stressful, especially when forecasts predict 125% higher-than-average activity for tropical storms. Protect your financial well-being in advance to ensure you can focus on your physical well-being if disaster strikes. A robust financial survival kit includes adequate homeowners insurance, flood insurance, a home inventory, cash, and important documentation, such as identification and proof of insurance. Before the season begins, prepare a list of vetted federal and local resources, too.",

This aligns well with NVIDIA's broader strategic focus on AI model scaling and data center growth, potentially leading to increased revenue streams from these partnerships. The expansion into sectors like autonomous vehicles with Toyota and Uber is likely to boost future revenues, given the automotive sector\u2019s rapid adoption of AI. Coupled with NVIDIA's launch of innovative GPU products, these moves support forecasts of continued revenue and earnings growth. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder returns have been exceptionally high, reporting a growth of very high percentage, reflecting long-term shareholder value creation. In the past year alone, NVIDIA's performance exceeded the US semiconductor industry, which returned 19.7%, underscoring its strong relative industry positioning. NVIDIA's current share price of US$113.54 reflects a 34% increase recently, yet it remains approximately 30.4% below the consensus analyst price target of US$163.12. This indicates analysts anticipate further upside, contingent on the company's ability to meet substantial earnings and revenue expectations. Analysts foresee NVIDIA's earnings reaching US$158.20 billion by 2028, with potential expansion in profit margins dependent on the efficacy of scaling operations and overcoming regulatory hurdles. The focus on enhancing Blackwell architecture and AI capabilities suggests robust future growth prospects, contributing to these optimistic forecasts.

        "content": "We recently published a list of11 AI Stocks On Wall Street\u2019s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. US President Donald Trump is all set to revive the country\u2019s struggling coal industry. Last month, he signed a series of executive orders so that the government could meet the surging energy demand of AI data centers. Executive Order 14241 will allow several older coal-fired plants about to retire to continue generating power for the foreseeable future. This will be done to meet the growing demand for artificial intelligence.READ NOW:10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street Right Nowand9 AI Stocks Poised to Gain from Trump\u2019s Middle East AI PushRepeatedly promoting coal as a power source for data centers, Trump told the World Economic Forum in January that he would be approving power plants for AI through an emergency declaration. He also called on tech companies to use coal as a backup power source. \u201cThey can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup \u2014 good, clean coal.\u201d However, with the tech industry investing billions of dollars to expand renewable energy and leveraging nuclear power as a way to meet its growing electricity demand, the use of coal is actually against the tech companies\u2019 environmental goals. Nevertheless, the tech industry does acknowledge that fossil fuel generation will eventually be needed to help navigate the electricity demand from AI. However, these companies are focusing on natural gas as it emits less half the CO2 of coal per kilowatt hour of power. \u201cTo have the energy we need for the grid, it\u2019s going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time. We\u2019re not surprised by the fact that we\u2019re going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term.\u201d We would certainly consider it but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say it\u2019s at the top of our list.\u201d -Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "header": "The Next Major Tech Stock Trend: Humanoid Robotics",
        "content": "Maybe it\u2019s just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we\u2019ve experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage. AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside. Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the \u201cWorld\u2019s First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.\u201d As this trend gains traction, it\u2019s only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we\u2019ll explore four stocks,Nvidia(NVDA),SoftBank Group(SFTBY), theGlobal X Robotics & AI ETF(BOTZ) andTesla(TSLA), that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolution Image Source: Zacks Investment Research According to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption. One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%. With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it\u2019s a market on the verge of exponential growth. Quite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world\u2019s most important tech companies are already leading the charge. Teslais making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla\u2019s car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation. Nvidia,the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia\u2019s chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine. SoftBank Grouphas been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank\u2019s portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off. For investors looking for broader exposure, theBOTZ ETFoffers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem. Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade. While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside. Investors don\u2019t need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.

        "content": "Inflation\u202fmay ebb and flow, but Warren Buffett's two lessons for fighting it are timeless. Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A;BRK.B), ranks \u201chuman capital\u201d above any ticker symbol. \"The best thing you can do is to be exceptionally good at something,\" he told shareholders in 2022. \"Whatever abilities you have can\u2019t be taken away from you. They can't actually be inflated away from you.\" Wage growth for scarce, highly skilled, high\u2011quality expertise typically outrunsinflation. A top orthopedic surgeon,cloud\u2011securityarchitect, or even an elite hair stylist can lift fees as costs climb because clients value outcomes more than raw inputs. Unlike a factory, your mind and reputation need no expensive upgrades\u2014just continuous practice and learning. And theInternal Revenue Codedoesn\u2019t levy a tax when you master a new skill. \"The best investment, by far, is anything that develops yourself,\" Buffett said. \"And again, it's not taxed.\" In 2008, he offered a similar answer when asked about thebest investment to hedgeagainst a debt crisis. \u201cDevelop your own talent. If you\u2019re the best doctor in town, if you\u2019re the best teacher in town, if you\u2019re, you know, the best salesman in town, you\u2019ll do well no matter what the currency does,\" he said. \"You will get your share. So investing in yourself is always the best thing.\" In that same 2008 interview, Buffett offered a runner-up strategy for fighting inflation. The \"second-best thing is to own products or stocks that have products that don\u2019t require much capital investment,\" he said. That's because the price of capital investment will rise with inflation. But companies that don't require a lot of capital, especially those with strong brands and pricing power, will endure inflationary periods relatively well. These are companies that enjoy consistent, durable demand and high margins without constant spending on capital-intensive assets like new factories. Investors should still scrutinize valuation, competitive threats, and debt levels. \u201cAsset-light\u201d does not automatically mean \u201cinflation-proof.\" But, historically, businesses with pricing power and minimal reinvestment needs have expanded earnings faster than theConsumer Price Index, cushioning shareholders againstpurchasing powererosion. Buffett\u2019s advice is strikingly simple. First, turn yourself into a must\u2011hire professional. According to Buffett, the best protection against inflation is \"your own personal earning power.\" Second, when you invest, favor businesses that don't need to spend capital and have the power to raise their own prices with little impact on sales.",

        "header": "S&P 500 vs. Total Market Index Funds: Which Is Better for Long-Term Growth?",
        "content": "Index funds provide efficient and low-cost broad market exposure, which makes them an ideal choice for long-term investment portfolios. Investors frequently look toS&P 500 indexfunds as well as \u201ctotal market\u201d index funds as their primary investment choices. TheS&P 500represents a collection of the 500 largest American publicly-traded companies that collectively account for about 80% of the total capitalization of the U.S. stock market.Large-capcompanies, like those found in the S&P, usually pose less investment risk when compared to smaller companies. Total market index funds expand their investment scope to include almost every public U.S. company of all sizes, which provides mid-cap and small-cap exposure that offers higher growth possibilities alongside large-caps, but which also often have higher volatility. This article compares S&P 500 funds with broader market funds across key factors: the degree of market exposure, past performance records, expected volatility levels, growth prospects, and the appropriateness for various investor profiles. S&P 500 index funds hold roughly 500 of the largest American-listed companies chosen by the S&P Index Committee. To be included in the index, these companies need to satisfy requirements formarket capitalization, which stands at a $20.5 billion minimum (as of January 2, 2025), liquidity standards, and profitability metrics. The index ismarket-cap weighted, and so assigns greater weight to larger companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, which results in these entities having a stronger impact on its performance compared to smaller components. Large-cap investments allow investors to access established multinational corporations with proven business models and stable cash flows that possess the resources to survive economic downturns. The backbone of the American economy consists of these companies that lead each major sector. S&P 500 funds prioritize large-cap stocks, which results in limited investment opportunities in smaller enterprises that are in early growth phases or new industry sectors. The restriction may limit extended growth potential when compared to broader market indexes. S&P 500 index funds often display less volatility than total market funds, which makes them an attractive choice for investors. Large-cap companies have historically shown greater stability, as they tend to be more mature and with more reliable revenue streams and stronger balance sheets, which help them weather economic difficulties. This means that the S&P 500 typically experiences less severe losses through bear markets compared to riskier indexes. This may appeal to more conservative investors who prefer lower risk exposure or who have shorter investment horizons\u2013even though this choice may also lead to somewhat lower long-term growth potential. Since itsestablishment in 1957, the S&P 500 has provided robust long-term investment performance by producing average yearly total returns upwards of 10%, before accounting for inflation\u2013and over 14% per year between 2020-2025.The exceptional performance of the S&P 500 throughout the last decade resulted from the significant expansion of leading technology companies like Apple, Nvidia, Google, and Meta (Facebook), among others. Throughout history, the index has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recovering from eachmajor market downturn. For instance, the index rebounded and eventually made new highs only a few years after the 2008 financial crisis that triggered a 56.8% decline. Total market index funds reflect the full U.S. equity market through the tracking of all-encompassing indexes such as theWilshire 500 Index, the CRSP US Total Market Index, or theRussell 3000 Index. Total market index funds that track one of these indices will contain 3,000 to 4,000 stocks that consist of every component of the S&P 500, along with thousands of other mid-cap and small-cap stocks. By investing in total market index funds, you achieve true diversification across all market-cap sizes and every economic sector. Large-cap stocks tend to maintain their dominance within these indexes as they represent around 80% of the total stock market by weight, but smaller companies in these indexes offer investors access to alternative growth dynamics and opportunities. Indeed, over extended periods, smaller companies tend to produce comparatively higher returns than larger companies\u2013but this comes with trade-offs that include higher volatility and steeper declines during bear markets. The \u201csmall-cap premium\u201d exists in some market cycles, but research shows that patient investors who maintain their investments for very long periods (e.g., 20 years or more) can benefit from the total market approach's enhanced growth potential. The wider scope of diversification of total market funds also decreases company-specific risk while still enabling potential gains from emerging sectors and innovative small companies that lack sufficient size for S&P 500 consideration. Since small and mid-cap stocks are often more volatile compared to large-cap stocks, total market indexes, too, become inherently more volatile than the S&P 500. The excess volatility comes from several sources: Total market funds therefore face more pronounced drawdowns during market corrections and bear markets because. Investors who check their portfolios regularly or feel uncomfortable with higher risk may find these large variations difficult to handle. Let'sconsider two Vanguard ETFs, one its S&P 500 fund (VOO) and the other its total market fund (VTI). Looking at their historical performance in the table below, we can see that the S&P 500 does have marginally lower risk metrics (a slightly higher Sharpe ratio,\u00a0 a slightly lower max drawdown, and standard deviation) but only marginally so. But over the past 10 years, in fact, theS&P 500 fund even outperformedthe total market fund by 0.66% per year (as of April 30, 2025)\u2013which contradicts the conventional wisdom that broader and smaller-cap exposure leads to better returns. This outperformance might be attributed to the dominance of large-cap growth stocks in the S&P 500, particularly tech giants, which have driven much of the market's gains during this period. Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet (Google) have delivered exceptional returns, benefiting S&P 500 funds that hold larger positions in these companies compared to total market funds. However, this pattern isn't necessarily indicative of future performance. Markets rotate over time, and there have been extended periods when small and mid-cap stocks outperformed their large-cap counterparts. For example, from 2000-2010, small-cap stocks generally outperformed large caps as the market recovered from the dot-com bubble. For most investors, an S&P 500 index fund is a suitable core holding. But it also excludes approximately 20% of U.S. market cap\u2014mid-, small-, and micro-caps that can act as growth engines and diversification buffers. No single index always outperforms. Over some decades, small-cap-heavy total market funds outperform; over others, large-cap concentrated S&P 500 funds lead. The long-term gap, however, is often quite small. By assets and cost, Vanguard\u2019s VOO (0.03% fee) and iShares\u2019 IVV (0.03%).By liquidity and popularity, SPDR\u2019s SPY (0.095%) tops the list (all as of April 30, 2025).Choose VOO or IVV for the lowest fees; SPY if you need ultra-high intraday liquidity or are trading options on the S&P 500. The iShares Russell 3000 ETF (IWV) earned 11.48% annualized over the 10 years, slightly below Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO) at 12.27% (as of April 30, 2025). Any ETF has the potential to outperform the S&P 500 in a given year. Small-cap ETFs (e.g., VB, IWM), equal-weight S&P 500 funds (RSP), or factor-tilted products (e.g., VUG for growth, VTV for value) sometimes outpace the cap-weighted S&P over various cycles and depending on the time horizons involved. Both S&P 500 and total-market index funds offer low-cost, tax-efficient access to broad swaths of the U.S. equities market. With fees now virtually identical, your choice hinges on how much small- and mid-cap exposure you desire versus how smooth a ride you need. An S&P 500 fund gives you a blue-chip, large-cap anchor with slightly less volatility; a total-market fund extends that anchor across thousands of smaller names for a modest return premium\u2014at the cost of a bumpier path. In practice, sticking with either through bull and bear markets matters far more than the tiny performance gaps between the two. Once you decide, automate contributions, rebalance annually, and focus on the horizon ahead.",

        "content": "By Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -German chipmaker Infineon said on Tuesday it will work with Nvidia on developing chips for new power delivery systems inside artificial intelligence data centers. Infineon said it will work with Nvidia to develop high-voltage, direct current power delivery systems. In current data centers, most high-voltage power is distributed as alternating current and then converted to the direct current needed by computer chips by individual power supply units inside of servers. But that method of distributing power introduces losses in moving power around and converting it. With each server rack within AI data centers expected to take a megawatt of power by the end of the decade, Infineon and Nvidia said they are hoping to reduce those losses by creating a centralized direct-current distribution system. \u201cThrough this innovative approach, Nvidia is able to optimize the energy consumption of our advanced AI infrastructure, which supports our commitment to sustainability while also delivering the performance and scalability required for the next generation of AI workloads,\u201d Gabriele Gorla, vice president of system engineering at Nvidia, said in a statement.

        "header": "What Record Money Market Balances Say About Investors' Views of Stocks",
        "content": "The amount of money sitting in money market funds hit a record $7 trillion in the first half of 2025, continuing a years-long surge of inflows into these short-term, low-risk investment vehicles. So what does that say about investors' attitudes toward stocks? Usually, investors dump cash (a money market fund is effectively a cash equivalent) and jump back into equities when the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate is tracking lower. These days the situation is a bit more complicated: President Donald Trump's tariffs have injected a lot of uncertainty into equity markets and the economic outlook. As a result, the Fed has hit \"pause\" on its rate cuts. That and the fact that money market rates remain attractive have made any decision to take a wait-and-see stance toward equities a lot easier. Money market fundspool investors\u2019 money and invest it in short-term, low-riskdebt securitieslike\u00a0Treasury bills,\u00a0commercial paper,\u00a0and\u00a0certificates of deposit.\u00a0They are designed to provide better returns than a checking or savings account without adding much risk or reducing liquidity. These funds pay out more wheninterest ratesare high. People and companies often use them as ashort-term safe havenwhile still earning a modest return. To understand why money is pouring into these funds, we first need to consider the rates the funds have been offering. Since late 2022, they've been at the highest level in many years, and as of May 2025 they remained around 4%, much higher than the rates seen from 2007 through 2022. For example, the3-month Treasury Bill, commonly used as a proxy for money market rates, averaged 0.51% from 2010 through 2021, and sat at 0.02% as of May 2021. It topped 5% in 2023-2024 as the Fed fought off inflation with aggressive rate hikes. Fed rate cuts have pushed it down to around 4%\u2014but even that is a good return for what is essentially a risk-free investment\u2014one many investors would have jumped at over the previous two and a half decades. The S&P 500 has historically returned about 10% annually before accounting for inflation. That\u2019s more than double what the best money market funds currently offer. So clearly, many investors have decided that, at least for the short term, they are happier playing it safe than chasing higher returns with added risk. Among the factors at play, many were created or exacerbated by Trump's tariffs: the risk of a recession, including one withhigher, tariff-driven inflation; possible long-term trade wars; and high equity valuations after an enormous run-up over the previous two years. (Consider that just three days after Trump's so-called Liberation Day tariffs announcement, the S&P 500 at one point traded 15% lower than the closing price reached the day before the announcement.) \u201cWhen investor nervousness and\u00a0volatility\u00a0are high in the markets, money market funds tend to become more popular,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Jesch, former global chief investment officer of European asset manager DWS. Despite recent interest rate cuts, money is pouring into money market funds. That is at least partly because they are offering relatively high returns. But it also implies that investors are cautious about the stock market. It seems many prefer to play it safe and preserve capital rather than take on more risk in search of higher returns. In other words, they believe the risks of equities currently outweigh the rewards.",

        "content": "AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)offloads ZT Systems' manufacturing armfor $3 billion while snapping up its 1,200-strong engineering team to sharpen its edge against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the data-center GPU race. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMD. Citi Research analysts, led by Christopher Danely, note that last August's $4.6 billion ZT deal has been split: Sanmina will acquire the factory business for $2.55 billion in cash and stock plus $450 million in earn-outs, while AMD retains the engineers for roughly $1.6 billionabout $1.33 million apieceto accelerate hyperscaler deployments and bolster system-level expertise. Danely argues that additional system experience and faster deployment times should help AMD close the gap on Nvidia's market share. Under the agreement, Sanmina becomes AMD's preferred manufacturing partner for cloud-rack and cluster-scale AI solutions, reflecting a strategic pivot from in-house production to a fab-lite model. The transaction, expected to close near year-end 2025, underscores AMD's focus on high-margin chip design over capital-intensive fabs. Citi kept its Neutral rating and $100 price target on AMD, highlighting the balance between near-term dilution from the $1.6 billion engineering buyout and long-term gains from faster product rollouts. AMD, which derives roughly 30% of sales from PCs, faces stiff competition not only from Nvidia in AI GPUs but also from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in data-center CPUs. By beefing up its in-house design team and offloading manufacturing risk, AMD aims to streamline R&D investment and speed time to market for MI300 and future MI400 data-center accelerators. Why It Matters: Retaining ZT's engineering talent while outsourcing production could deliver faster hyperscaler deployments and help AMD narrow the performance and deployment gap with Nvidia's entrenched data-center GPU ecosystem.

        "content": "It\u2019s harder than ever for Tesla (TSLA) investors to justify the stock\u2019ssky-high share price, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote to clients this week, and suggested that\u2019s likely to get worse before it improves. Tesla's valuation \"problem\" Morgan Stanley sees is that many investors conceptualize Tesla solely as an electric vehicle company. Looking at that activity alone, the bank said it values Tesla\u2019s core auto business at $75 per share\u2014well below the stock's level around $345 in recent trading. But stopping at Tesla\u2019s car business \u201cis akin tovaluingAmazon as solely an online retailer or Apple as a seller of glowing rectangles and earbuds,\u201d the analysts said. Putting EVs aside, the Elon Musk-led company represents a tough-to-evaluate portfolio of \"startups\u201d that includesautonomous drivingtechnology,energy storage, artificial intelligence, and humanoid robotics as potential growth catalysts. That makes a firm valuation tough for investors to pin down, as \"the majority of the company's current $1.1 trillion market cap is based on businesses that have either poordisclosure, no disclosure, or that have yet to be launched into the commercial market at all,\u201d Morgan Stanley said. The bank has a bullish target of $410, which it breaks down into five buckets: $75 a share for the EV business, $160 for in-car software services, $90 for robotaxis, $67 for energy storage, and $17 for Tesla as a third-party supplier to other companies. It does not currently include a valuation for Tesla Optimus, the humanoid robot division, which the bank said ultimately could serve an even larger addressable market than its EVs do. Morgan Stanley's target is almost a 20% premium over Tesla\u2019s closing price Monday and far more bullish than the consensus target of about $296 among analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Meanwhile, Musk said in an interview Tuesday that he is committed to remaining Tesla\u2019s CEO for at least thenext five years. Musk told attendees of the Qatar Economic Forum said that he is currently spending just about one to two days per week on his work with the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts, following up on a promise he made during Tesla's earnings call last month tospend more timewith the EV maker.",

The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, ending a string of six consecutive positive trading sessions. The Nasdaq also closed 0.4% lower, while the Dow was down 0.3%. Shares of credit score provider Fair Isaac (FICO) tumbled 8.1%, posting the weakest daily performance in the S&P 500. The move lower followed comments from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), who raised concerns about FICO's pricing and expressed support for more cost-effective credit evaluation options. AES Corp.

Analysts at Truist reduced their price target on shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH). The firm noted that slumping consumer confidence would affect demand for cruises, although it may take a quarter or two for earnings and other metrics to reflect the impact given extended booking periods.

        "content": "AI server demand maintains momentumas PC remains sluggish: Wells Fargo. With quarterly earnings season kicking off, Wells Fargo analysts led by Aaron Rakers highlighted Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) as a top pick, driven by accelerating AI server orders even as consumer PC sales languish. The bank expects Dell to reiterate its FY26 guidance and zero in on a path to more than $10 per share in EPS, backed by over $15 billion in projected AI-server revenue next fiscal year. Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GB200 NVL ramp from Hopper to Blackwell should further bolster Dell's data-center mix, as organizations shift capital away from muted PC upgrades toward high-performance AI infrastructure. Consensus forecasts call for adjusted EPS of $1.68 on $23.17 billion in revenue when Dell reports Q1 FY26 results after the close on May 29. By contrast, Hewlett Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) consumer-facing PC segment remains under pressure, earning HP Inc. an Underweight rating and $35 price target, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise benefits from server tailwinds and holds an Equal-weight rating with a $22 target ahead of its June 3 report and a July 9 bench trial on the Juniper acquisition. Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) also steps into the spotlight on May 28, fresh off a deal to serve as Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) preferred storage partnera win that underscores how hyperscalers are reshaping vendor landscapes. Why It Matters: As capex shifts toward AI workloads, hardware leaders with robust server portfolios and close ties to Nvidia stand to outperform peers tethered to the soft PC market. Investors will be watching May's earnings cadenceHP on May 28, Dell on May 29 and HPE on June 3to gauge whether AI-driven demand can sustain momentum and translate into outsized financial results.

The firm\u2019s analysts highlighted the company\u2019s recent announcements, including the new NVlink Fusion interconnect technology, which enables integration with custom ASICs and non-NVIDIA CPUs, including those from Qualcomm and Fujitsu. The firm\u2019s analysts noted that further analysis is needed to better understand how this can affect customer choices and competition, especially compared to the upcoming UAlink technology. A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also unveiled RTX PRO servers designed for the enterprise AI inference market. These servers feature NVIDIA networking technologies and up to 8 Blackwell RTX Pro Graphics 6000 cards. The company aims to expand its enterprise solutions and the RTX PRO servers will support the company\u2019s AI enterprise software platform. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) upgraded its robotics foundation model, Isaac GR00T, by adding a new synthetic data generation framework called Isaac GR00T-Dreams. This update will improve training for humanoid robots. The company is also close to launching its first personal workstation computers. The DGX Spark is expected to launch in July and the DGX Station will launch later this year. The company is also making strategic moves to strengthen its global presence and announced a partnership with Foxconn and the Taiwan government to build a supercomputer with 10,000 Blackwell GPUs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is expected to be the main customer for this project. Furthermore, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is planning to open a new office in Taiwan. The firm\u2019s analysis noted some challenges for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), including a revenue headwind of over $5 billion because of the US Commerce Department banning H20 sales in China and the early-year issues with the GB200. However, Morgan Stanley expects the company to address these problems over time and expects a strong second half of the year for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. A sudden job loss can throw anyone's finances into a tailspin. While your regular paycheck will stop arriving, all of your monthly bills, your rent or mortgage payment, and your need to buy groceries will keep marching on. The mere prospect of this can bring on significant anxiety. But a loss of income doesn't have to turn into a financial disaster. If you can plan ahead andbuild up a classic emergency fund, you may be able to keep the situation from becoming an emergency at all. And the more you have in reserve, the longer you can weather the storm of a job loss. Luckily, you have financial history in your corner right now. That's because today's interest rates are historically high, offering dozens of options to earn returns on your cash in the 4% range, or even 5% and up. That means whatever money you stash in your safety net can be boosted into something bigger, simply by being smart about where you put the money. The most obvious option is a high-yield savings account. These accounts are often offered by online banks, so you may need to open an account outside your primary checking institution. But doing so can significantly amp up what you earn on your emergency money. Consider that the national average rate for savings accounts is currently 0.42%, while many of the biggest banks, like Chase and Bank of America, pay even worse with a near-zero rate of 0.01% on their savings accounts.Then consider that our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts includes16 options that pay 4.35% to 5.00% APY. In other words, you can multiply your interest earnings by 10 (or even more) by choosing a top-paying savings account vs. just an average savings account. And that boost can help propel you toward your safety net goal. Another option is a high-yield checking account. Though not as common or generally as straightforward as high-yield savings accounts, high-interest checking accounts sometimes pay even more. Right now,the top checking options pay 5.00% to 6.00%. The catch is that you typically have to jump through a hoop or two to earn these ultra-high rates every month. Have the ability to set updirect depositstotaling at least $2,000 each month? Then mph.bank's high-yield checking account is hard to beat. While other accounts require 12\u201315 debit transactions a month to earn the high APY,mph will pay 5.00%in every month that you meet its direct deposit requirement. In addition, its maximum balance cap for the 5.00% APY is a generous $50,000, which provides enough room for most people's emergency fund. If you have some of your safety net in investments rather than just in the bank, you may have options for harvesting some cash from these accounts. Selling the actual investments, like a stock orindex fund, may not be something you'd want to do in an emergency since it can have significant tax implications and may also require you to sell when the market is down. But anycashyou can collect from these investments could be useful if you're still building your safety reserve. First, if any of your stocks,mutual funds, orETFspay a quarterly or annualdividend, you can capture that cash and add it to your emergency fund. The key is to turn off the option toreinvest dividendsfor that account. Once you do that, any received dividend payments will be deposited to your account as cash. Next, check how your uninvested cash is being held. If it's going into a money market fund that pays just 2%\u20133%, you can likely do better by asking your brokerage to sweep your uninvested funds into acash management account\u2014many of which pay 4% or more right now. Lastly, even if you can bump up to a higher cash APY at your brokerage, that still might not hold a candle to what you could earn by transferring the money to a high-yield savings or checking account. Cash transfers between brokerages and banks are easy to set up and are usually executed within a day. That means moving dividend money out of your brokerage account as soon as you receive it is simple, allowing you to quickly put it to work earning a stronger return in your high-yield bank account. We update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available: Note that the \"top rates\" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

A new downgraded chip is in the works as Nvidia seeks to retain footing in a critical growth market. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Revenue from China totaled $17 billion in the fiscal year ending January 26, 2025, representing 13% of Nvidia's total sales. The H20 chip was the only remaining product in the Hopper series legally permitted for export to China under U.S. rules. Huang confirmed in a livestream that no further Hopper updates are possible, stating, It's not Hopper because it's not possible to modify Hopper anymore, according to Taiwan's Formosa TV. The company is expected to release a downgraded H20 chip within two months, according to earlier reports from Reuters, to help regain lost market share from competitors like Huawei. The Biden administration's Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, issued in January 2025, imposed new export restrictions, which have been criticized by Huang. He argued that the U.S. should focus on maximizing the global reach of its technologies rather than restricting exports. President Donald Trump has pledged to revoke those rules, calling them counterproductive to U.S. interests in global tech leadership. Huang visited China shortly after the H20 restrictions took effect, signaling Nvidia's ongoing commitment to the region despite tightened rules. Seeinsidertrades for NVDA ExplorePeter Lynch chart.

        "header": "GOP Is Proposing Two Tax-Advantaged Savings Accounts\u2014Including One With a $1,000 Bonus for Babies",
        "content": " Two Republican proposals could change the way consumers save money, with both providing tax incentives to encourage people to save more. The main opposition to these proposals is that they would increase federal spending and help wealthy people more than those with low or moderate incomes. The current GOP budget bill that is being ironed out includes a proposed \u201cmoney account for growth and advancement\u201d (MAGA) account. The Treasury Department would contribute a $1,000 deposit for every baby born between 2025 and 2028 whose parents have Social Security numbers. Friends, family, employers, governments, and nonprofit groups could contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the money in the account could be invested in stocks. The money could be withdrawn after the child reaches age 18 and, if used for qualified expenses, any earnings would get a tax break.\u00a0 Qualified expenses include education, starting a business, or buying a home. The tax benefits are still being discussed. A committee summary of the bill says disbursements for qualified expenses would be taxed aslong-term capital gains, a rate that is lower thanordinary income taxrates.The full House plan says the funds would not be subject to taxation at all. Either way, withdrawals for non-qualified expenses would be subject to ordinary income tax. Parents could also open an account for children under the age of eight, but only newborns would get the $1,000 deposit from the federal government. The beneficiary could withdraw half of the money between the ages of 18 and 25 for qualified expenses, with the other half becoming available for these expenses at age 25. The money could be used for any purpose after the account holder turns 30. Parents can already contribute to tax-advantaged education accounts for their children, known as529 accounts. Details vary by state, but if the funds are used for qualified education expenses, the money grows and can be withdrawn tax-free. Some states also offer other tax deductions and credits for educational expenses. For instance, Colorado provides a $118 contribution to 529 accounts for newborns and matches up to $500 a year of contributions during the first five years of the account. Parents wouldn\u2019t need to choose between a 529 account or a MAGA account. They could contribute to both, or simply manage investments for the MAGA account to maximize its growth. A separate proposed savings plan\u2014called a universal savings account (USA)\u2014would offer tax-advantaged savings to all citizens, not just parents. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced the USA bill on May 1, 2025, along with companion legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) This account most closely resembles aRoth IRA, but with fewer restrictions. Roth IRAs let you save earned income up to a certain amount every year ($7,000 for 2025, or $8,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older). The contributions are taxable, but the money grows tax-free and can be withdrawn after age 59 \u00bd without taxes or penalties. If you withdraw before then, you may be subject to a 10% tax penalty. But you can only contribute to a Roth IRA if your income is below a certain amount ($165,000 for single tax filers in 2025, with the allowed contribution reduced for people who make at least $150,000).The proposed USA option does not limit contributions based on income, and it offers tax-free distributions. The universal savings account would allow an initial deposit of up to $10,000, with contribution increases of $500 per year, up to a $25,000 annual limit. Supporters of the USA bill cite the restrictions on current tax-advantaged savings accounts such as Roth IRAs and401(k)s, which may not be accessible before retirement or have complex rules and usage limitations. They say USA plans may increase participation in long-term savings, while freeing funds for short-term needs\u2014like education and health care\u2014without forcing account holders to payearly withdrawal penalties. But opponents of USAs argue that such plans would mostly benefit the wealthy and could reduce federal revenue. Commenting on an earlier USA proposal, the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said initially, federal revenue could increase as 401(k) and IRA account holders, who enjoy tax-deferred benefits, switch to USAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars. But without taxes on withdrawals, revenue could later fall. In other words, the longer investors enjoy the tax advantages of a USA plan, the more the federal government will be deprived of tax revenue. The Center also said studies show that tax subsidies do not increase overall savings rates.In fact, because the USA could make it easier to withdraw funds at any time and for any purpose, savings rates could actually fall, it says. Roth IRAsare a popular retirement plan choice, particularly for low- to moderate-income households. They're designed as a retirement investment vehicle. As such, federal tax laws impose penalties on withdrawals before age 59 \u00bd, unless you meet certain exception requirements. While Roth IRAs have advantages, USAs may offer a more hassle-free way to invest for retirement or for shorter-term savings goals. In Canada,tax-free savings accounts(TFSAs) have offered tax-free savings since 2009. TFSAs allow account holders to make after-tax contributions and withdraw at any time, for any reason, without facing tax penalties. In 2024, Canadian law capped TFSA contributions at around $5,200 (CA$ 7,000).If an account holder makes a withdrawal, the following year they can increase their annual contribution up to the amount of the distribution. According to the Tax Foundation, 58% of Canadians have TFSAs, while 46% own retirement plans like 401(k)s and IRAs. TFSAs have proven very successful among low- and middle-income households, who often increase their contributions as their incomes rise. The United Kingdom offers individual savings accounts (ISAs), a newer version of personal equity plans, which were introduced in 1986.\u00a0 In the 2025 to 2026 tax year, UK law allowed ISA account holders to make annual contributions of about $25,000 (\u00a320,000). Typically, ISAs serve as a supplement to UK pension plans. ISAs operate like Roth plans, allowing account holders to make after-tax contributions and receive tax-free earnings growth. ISAs don\u2019t have income limits and do not impose penalties and restrictions on withdrawals. Account holders also have the option to build a nest egg for their children by contributing up to \u00a39,000 per year in a separate Junior ISA. Around 42% of eligible UK residents contribute to ISAs, which have proven particularly popular among low- and middle-income households. Based on 2022 data, the average UK ISA account has a value of \u00a333,278. The UK\u2019s ISA plan operates like a regular investment or savings account, allowing account holders to use their funds when needs arise without facing restrictions or taxes on returns. USAs may offer advantages to seasoned and new investors. They would give you the option to transfer funds from a taxable account to build tax-free earnings, which you could use any time for any purpose. Moderate- and high-income households might choose to keep their 401(k) and Roth IRA plans and open USAs to supplement their retirement income. USAs do not impose penalties for early withdrawal, giving you the ability to tap into your balance to pay for unexpected expenses such as home repairs or medical bills. Because USAs feature tax-free withdrawals, individuals and families could use them to save for special goals, such as buying a new house or paying for a college education. A USA might also serve as an alternative to a health savings account, providing money for medical emergencies, while offering flexibility to use funds for other types of emergencies. According to the Tax Foundation, USAs would operate like a standard investment account, enabling account holders to invest in stocks, bonds, money market funds, and mutual funds. Investment options may vary depending on the financial institution that administers the USA. Standard investment and savings accounts typically charge low administrative fees, allowing the investor to use a USA to diversify their investment portfolio",

        "content": "Shares of Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin that until recently was known as MicroStrategy, rose again Tuesday as the digital currency continued rising. The stock, which provides investors with a leverage bet on bitcoin's price, had gotten a boost to start the week after the company announced its latest purchase of the cryptocurrency. According to a regulatory filing on Monday, Strategy purchased 7,390 bitcoin between May 12 and 18, taking its total holding to 576,230 BTC, currently worth more about $61 billion based on bitcoin's recent price. Strategy shares have soared 75% from their April low, tracking a recovery in the price of bitcoin and otherrisk-onassets as investor concerns about global trade tensions and their potential economic impact have subsided. Bitcoin surged above $107,000 on Tuesday, hitting its highest level since January and approaching its record high of just over $109,000. Below, we take a closer look at Strategy\u2019sweekly chartand applytechnical analysisto point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. Since the50-day moving average (MA)crossed above the 200-day MA in January last year to form a bullishgolden crosspattern, Strategy shares have continued to trend sharply higher. More recently, the stock has climbed back toward itsrecord highthroughout April and May following a retracement to the 50-day MA in March. However, it's worth noting this move has occurred on significantly lesstrading volumethan the two most prioruptrends, indicating that larger market participants may remain on the sidelines. Let\u2019s identify two key overhead areas on Strategy\u2019s chart to watch if the shares continue their bullish move, while also locating crucialsupport levelsworth monitoring duringcorrections. A move higher from current levels could bring the $440 level into play. This area may provide overheadresistancenear a brief consolidation period that developed on the chart shortly after the stock set itsrecord highlast November. To forecast an overhead area to watch if the shares move intoprice discoverymode, investors can use the bars pattern tool. We apply this technique by taking the price bars from the stock\u2019strendingmove from September to November and reposition them from the start of the current uptrend. This analysis, which predicts how a move higher may play out ifprice actionrhymes, projects an upside target of around $945. During a correction in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $230 level. This location on the chart could attract buying interest near the February and Marchtroughs, and also closely aligns with a slight pause in the stock\u2019s uptrend during late October. Finally, a more significant drop could see Strategy shares test lower support around $180.

This agreement comes as AI companies face mounting scrutiny over how they train their models, and as publishers push for compensation and transparency,Reutersreports. The partnership is part of Perplexity's broader effort to integrate reliable journalism into its search platform. The startup has already signed deals with over a dozen publishers, including the Los Angeles Times and the U.K.'s Independent,Reuters says. These collaborations aim to ensure that the AI-generated answers on Perplexity's platform are rooted in high-quality, verifiable content. According to Reuters, these partnerships also include an ad revenue-sharing model designed to benefit the content providers whose work powers Perplexity's responses.

Announced with a slate of high-profile media partners including Time, Der Spiegel, Fortune and Entrepreneur, the initiative offers revenue sharing for publishers whose content is cited in Perplexity's AI-generated answers. The model includes advertising through a \"related questions\" feature, giving brands the ability to insert follow-up queries and creating new monetization streams for participating outlets, the company said. According to Perplexity, the program also provides partners with free access to its online large language model application programming interfaces, allowing them to build custom answer engines using only their own content. Publisher staff will receive complimentary access to Enterprise Pro, Perplexity's privacy-enhanced research tool, for one year. The broader goal is to equip media companies with tools to expand reach, drive engagement, and retain control over how their work is surfaced in the AI ecosystem.

While partnerships like the one with Le Monde represent a collaborative path forward, not all media organizations are on board. Several AI companies are currently facing legal action from news outlets who accuse them of using copyrighted content without permission during model training, Reuters reports. The lawsuits reflect the growing tension between innovation and ownership, especially as generative AI tools continue to blur the lines between original content and synthesized responses. According to Reuters, Le Monde CEOLouis Dreyfusemphasized that the agreement with Perplexity was not just about content licensing. \u201cAt Le Monde, we have continued to explore new partnerships with leading AI players to enlarge our audience, expand our development capacities, and to build new sources of revenues,\u201d he said. As AI reshapes how information is discovered and consumed, deals like this one between Le Monde and Perplexity may set the tone for the future. With strong backing, rising adoption, and a growing list of media collaborators, Perplexity aims to build the future of how the world reads, learns, and connects with verified truth.
