        "header": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "It's always a good idea to monitor what myriad industry participants say about the market before buying into a stock, and that's definitely the case withNvidia(NVDA-0.62%). The technology company's main demand driver is spending on artificial intelligence (AI) and the data centers necessary to support its growth. Despite many fears and analyst questions in the recent earnings calls, there's no real sign of weakening AI demand and spending on data centers. On the contrary, there's plenty of evidence suggesting that data center demand is holding up or even accelerating. Here are three reasons: There was nothing wrong with AI and data center spending in the first quarter. Google parentAlphabet), said growth in its AI products was \"much higher\" than Google Cloud's 28% revenue growth rate in the quarter. It was a similar story at another of the largest hyperscalers, whenMicrosoftchief financial officer Amy Hood told investors on its earnings call, \"And again, this quarter, revenue from our AI business was above expectations.\" The pick-and-shovel players echoed this theme. For example, Nivdia partnerVertiv, which offers crucial digital infrastructure to data centers and communications companies, increased its backlog by 10% to $7.9 billion in the first quarter compared to the end of 2024, and reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4. AndnVent Electric, which supplies electrical connection and protection products, has been aggressively investing to increase its data center exposure. On its earnings call, CEO Beth Wozniak reported mid-teens order growth with \"strong double-digit growth in data solutions and mid-single-digit growth in the rest of the business.\" Image source: Getty Images. For nVent, data center growth isn't slowing. In fact, Wozniak is seeing \"an acceleration and increased demand for our solutions.\"  It's a viewpoint mirrored by mechanical and electrical contractorComfort Systems USA, which currently generates 37% of revenue from working on data centers and semiconductor fabrication plants. Its chief financial officer, William George, recently told investors, \"There is no sign of a let-up in demand for electricians, and pipe fitters, and plumbers to help build data centers.\" Vertiv CEO Giordano Albertazzi said that the 12-month-out pipeline and beyond was growing. Image source: Getty Images. In concert with its torrid rate of growth in AI products, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, \"We are definitely investing more\" in AI, and management confirmed its intent to make $75 billion in capital investments overall in 2025. It was a similar story at hyperscaler Microsoft, whose management said it was short of data center space. There were fears about the spending outlook in this category because Microsoft was reportedly pulling back on data center leases and halting projects. However, CEO Satya Nadella commented on the need to balance data center investment with where the workload will be and the fact that Microsoft Azure is short of data center space overall, which suggests the pullbacks were more to do with adjustments in the location of spending rather than a general pullback. While a pullback in data center spending could always happen, there's no evidence of it so far -- and no suggestion, at least from the companies discussed above, that one is coming anytime soon. That's great news for Nvidia investors, and it's also important to note because the market has had a month to digest the new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. As such, Nvidia and the other data center stocks remain in play.",

        "header": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Ready for a Bull Run",
        "content": "Over the past decade, more companies recognized the disruptive potential of artificial intelligence (AI) applications across multiple industries. AI services could be used to automate repetitive tasks, replace a broad range of human jobs, crunch massive amounts of data, and predict future trends. As a result, manyAI-drivenstocks skyrocketed. The obvious winner wasNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which supplied most of the graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing those AI tasks. But investors shouldn't ignore the other AI-oriented companies that will profit from that secular trend. Three of those oft-overlooked stocks --Advanced Micro Devices(AMD1.14%),Super Micro Computer(SMCI-0.28%), andThe Trade Desk(TTD18.71%)-- could weather the near-term macroheadwinds and rush higher over the next few years. Here's why these three AI stocks are ready for a bull run. Image source: Getty Images. AMD, the world's second-largest producer of x86 central processing units (CPUs) and discrete GPUs, generally doesn't get as much attention as Nvidia as an AI investment. However, it also sells data center GPUs for processing complex machine learning and AI tasks. AMD launched its first batch of Instinct GPUs for data centers in 2017. It claims its latest MI325X Instinct GPUs, which arrived in late 2024, has roughly twice the memory capacity, 1.3 times the memory bandwidth, and 1.3 times the AI compute performance of Nvidia's H200 GPU. It plans to launch its even more powerful MI350 and MI355X Instinct GPUs this year. AMD's Instinct GPUs cost roughly half as much as Nvidia's comparable GPUs. That makes them ideal for cost-conscious companies trying to scale up their AI services. It's also challenging Intel's Xeon CPUs with its cheaper Epyc CPUs for servers. Thanks to those chips, AMD's data center sales surged 57% year over year in its latest quarter and accounted for 49% of its top line. Its sales of Ryzen CPUs for PCs also surged as it continued to pull original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) away from Intel. For 2025, analysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to increase 21% and 33%, respectively. It might facesome pressurefrom the tariffs, export curbs against China, and intensifying trade wars, but it still looks reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings. If those headwinds dissipate, AMD could command a higher valuation and climb higher over the next few years. Super Micro Computer, also known as Supermicro, produces liquid-cooled AI servers which are exclusively used to process AI applications. Its close relationship with Nvidia granted it a steady supply of the chipmaker's top-tier GPUs, and it's also installing more AMD GPUs in its systems. Supermicro is an underdog in the traditional server market, but it carved out a defensible niche with its dedicated AI servers. According to KeyBanc Capital Markets, Supermicro likely more than doubled its share of the AI server market from 10% in 2023 to 23% in 2024. For fiscal 2025 (which ends this June), analysts expect Supermicro's revenue to rise 57% but its adjusted EPS to only grow 2% as it grapples with delayed customer purchases, declining gross margins, and the impact of the rising tariffs. But for fiscal 2026, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 41% and 56%, respectively, as it overcomes most of those challenges. Those are high growth rates for a stock that trades at 14 times forward earnings. Supermicro's valuations were also compressed byconcerns regardingits delayed 10-K filing and potential regulatory probes over the past year. But as it resolves those issues and the AI market stabilizes, Supermicro could command a much higher valuation again. The Trade Desk owns the world's largest independent demand-side platform (DSP) for digital ads, and it sells advertising space across desktop, mobile, and connected TV (CTV) platforms. It helps advertisers break free of the \"walled gardens\" atAlphabet's Google andMeta Platformsto sell more ads across the \"open internet.\" A lot of its recent growth was driven by ad-supported streaming video services instead of desktop and mobile ads. The Trade Desk might seem like an ad tech company instead of an AI one. But its ad placement platform Solimar, which was launched in 2021, uses AI algorithms to collect more first-party data for targeted ads, help advertisers set specific business objectives, and access clearer performance metrics. It's also rolling out a new Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) solution to replace traditional tracking cookies, and it's been building its own operating system (OS) for smart TVs -- called Ventura -- to host its own programmatic ad spots. All of these irons in the fire should fuel The Trade Desk's growth and widen its moat against Google, Meta, and other diversified advertising giants. For 2025, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 17% and 6%, respectively, even as the tariffs drive some companies to rein in their ad spending. Its stock isn't cheap at 50 times forward earnings, but it's still a great play on the growth of the automated, AI-powered advertising market.",

        "header": "1 Glorious Growth Stock That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million by 2035",
        "content": "Uber Technologies(UBER0.63%)operates the world's largest ride-hailing network, along with popular food delivery and commercial freight services. It relies on 8.5 million drivers and couriers to fulfill demand from its 170 million monthly active customers, but the company is on the cusp of a major shift that could transform its financial results. Uber has signed partnerships with 18 companies that develop autonomous cars, robots, and even aircraft, and that list is growing. Since human drivers are the company's largest cost, these deals could result in billions of dollars in savings every year, which will flow through to Uber's revenue and its bottom line. In fact, I think Uber stock could soar fivefold within the next decade thanks to autonomous technologies. Here's how it could turn a $200,000 investment into $1 million by 2035. Image source: Getty Images. During the first quarter of 2025 (ended March 31), Uber reported $42.8 billion in gross bookings, which was the dollar value of every trip, food order, and commercial delivery the platform facilitated on behalf of its customers. The $18.6 billion drivers and couriers earned during the quarter was the single-largest component of the gross bookings figure. After deducting a further $12.9 billion in merchant payouts (money paid to restaurants for customers' food orders, as an example), Uber was left with $11.5 billion in revenue. Then, once the company factored in operating costs like marketing and research and development, itsnet income(profit) for the quarter came in at $1.7 billion on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. In other words, Uber doesn't get to keep a whole lot of the money customers spend on its platform. That's why autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform its economics -- ifself-driving carsand robots reduce Uber's reliance on human drivers, the company could pocket an additional $18.6 billion from its gross bookings each quarter (based on its Q1 result). Uber would have to pay some of that money to the companies deploying their self-driving cars into its network, but since they can operate 24/7, the economics are still likely to be significantly better than using human drivers. Plus, Ubercouldchoose to buy a fleet of autonomous vehicles and operate them itself, which would be even more profitable over the long term. In his prepared remarks to shareholders for the 2025 first quarter, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Uber had partnerships with 18 different providers of autonomous vehicles, up from 14 just six months earlier. Simply put, developers want to deploy their vehicles into the mobility network with the most users so they can maximize theirrevenue, which gives Uber a distinct advantage over the competition. Many of those partnerships are already producing results, because Uber is now facilitating around 1.5 million autonomous trips per year (annualized based on its Q1 results). Many of those are attributable toAlphabet'sWaymo, which is completing over 250,000 paid autonomous trips per week -- some through its own ride-hailing service, and some through Uber. Waymohas been operating in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, but it entered Austin, Texas, in March as part of an exclusive deal with Uber. It has 100 autonomous vehicles available in that market right now, and Uber says they are busier than 99% of the platform's human drivers in the area. The two companies will deploy hundreds more driverless cars in Austin over the next few months, and they plan to expand into Atlanta. Waymo is already a raging success, but Uber wants to help its other autonomous partners commercialize their technologies more quickly, because they have so much potential to save the company money on human drivers. As a result, it entered a unique partnership withNvidiaearlier this year, which is the world's leading supplier of chips and software forartificial intelligence(AI) development. Uber will use Nvidia's DGX Cloud supercomputer platform to process data from the billions of trips it facilitates each year, which will help its autonomous partners create more powerful self-driving models. Uber will also use Nvidia's Cosmos foundation models to create real-world training simulations, which will speed up the development process even further. Based on Uber's trailing-12-month revenue of $45.3 billion and itsmarket capitalizationof $174 billion, its stock trades at aprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof around 4, as of this writing. That's a slight discount to its average of 4.2, dating back to when the company went public in 2019:  UBER PS Ratiodata byYCharts If we assume Uber's P/S ratio remains constant at 4, the company will need to generate around $226.5 billion in annual revenue by 2035 to justify a fivefold return in its stock. That translates to a compound annual growth rate of 17.5% over the next decade. Between 2017 and 2024, Uber actually grew its revenue at a much faster annual rate of 27.7%, which suggests it should have no trouble hitting the mark. However, it becomes harder for Uber to grow that quickly as its revenue base becomes larger. According to Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance), the company is expected to grow its revenue by just 14% annually for the next two years. If that trend continues, it could take much longer than a decade for Uber stock to turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million. But remember this: Uber stands to pocket an extra $18 billion every quarter if it can eliminate human drivers completely. It certainly won't happen overnight, but the gradual shift toward autonomous vehicles could be a monumental tailwind for its revenue for the next several years. In fact, Khosrowshahi thinks the autonomous opportunity will be worth over $1 trillion to Uber in the U.S. alone. Therefore, while it's possible Uber delivers below-trend revenue growth for the next couple of years, it could accelerate later this decade (and beyond) as more self-driving cars hit the road. As long as the company's revenue growthaverages17.5% over the next 10 years, it will lay the foundation for a fivefold return in its stock.",

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Soar After May 28",
        "content": "May 28 will be an important day for the stock ofNvidia(NVDA-0.62%). That's when it reports fiscal 2026 first-quarter results. While earnings reports may not be the most exciting activity, they are one of a handful of times each year that investors get information about a company. A lot has occurred since the last time we received an update from Nvidia, and the pessimism surrounding the stock heading into this date is noteworthy. I think the pessimism will be unnecessary and that the stock could be primed to explode higher following the earnings announcement on May 28. Image source: Nvidia. Why am I so confident that the company will post solid results for the first quarter? Its primary clients have already confirmed that they will keep the status quo. Nvidia makesgraphics processing units (GPUs), which are chips that specialize in complex computational tasks, such as gaming graphics (their original use) and training AI models (their current most-common use). The company has the best GPUs available, which has helped it attain an impressive 90%-plus market share in data center GPUs. The biggest concern heading into the quarterly report is that the chipmaker's largest clients have slowed their purchases. Because there are still many high expectations built into the stock price, investors are worried it won't live up to expectations. However, after hearing from the AI hyperscalers that are large buyers of the company's GPUs, it's clear that data center spending is going full steam ahead. And one --Meta Platforms-- has even upped its capital expenditure (capex) guidance. Nvidia's sustained growth is crucial since the stock's current valuation assumes that its rapid increase will continue.  NVDA PE ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. The spread between thetrailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)and theforward P/Eindicates how much analysts expect earnings to grow this year. With the stock trading at 38.7 times trailing earnings and 25.7 times forward earnings, that projects about 51% growth. However, this will be the last quarter of the year when Nvidia's P/E remains normal. Because of a change in export restrictions to China, it had to take a $5.5 billion write-off this quarter, so investors shouldn't be alarmed when it reports a drop in profits. The real number to keep an eye on is growth, and that's expected to be strong for years to come. While one-year returns are nice, keeping focused on the three- to five-year horizon gives investors an edge. One guiding light that CEO Jensen Huang gave them is that Nvidia expects data center capex to rise from $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. That's monster growth, and if it turns out to be true, it doesn't matter what happens to the stock after the first quarter since the long term will still be incredibly promising. Over the past 12 months, the company has generated $115 billion from its data center division, which indicates that Nvidia gets around 30% of total spending on data center infrastructure. If Huang's $1 trillion projection turns out to be true and his company can maintain a 30% hold on that spending, it would generate $300 billion from data center GPU sales. That would be incredible growth, making it a solid stock. Even if expectations fall short of that lofty figure, Nvidia is still the top dog in the GPU world, and with a massive amount of AI infrastructure still to be built,it's an excellent investment.",

        "header": "AMD: Is It Time to Buy the Stock Before Its AI Growth Explodes?",
        "content": "WhenAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.14%)reported its first-quarter results recently, it gave a glimpse into why some investors remain excited about the stock's prospects despite its poor performance over the past year. As of this writing, the stock is down about 35% during that span. This excitement stems from the revenue growth the company is seeing in its data center segment, where sales soared 57% to $3.7 billion. While that revenue is a fraction of what rivalNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)generates, the growth is nonetheless robust. AMD credited its strong data center growth to its continuedcentral processing unit (CPU)server share gains and robust growth from its Instinctgraphics processing units (GPUs). AMD has recently become the leader in the data center CPU space. While GPUs provide the power, CPUs are the brains behind the operations. The market is not nearly as big as the one for GPUs in the data center space, but it's still an important and growing market. In the quarter, several cloud computing providers started to offer new computing options based on AMD's latest EPYC chips. Its CPUs also saw strong growth in the enterprise segment. AMD saw several hyperscalers (owners of massive data centers) expand their use of its GPUs for generativeartificial intelligence (AI)tasks, such as AI search, rankings, and recommendations. It also said that one of the largest AI model companies is now using its GPUs to run a significant portion of its dailyinferencetraffic. It added that big tech companies and AI start-ups are also now using its GPUs to help train their next-gen AI models. While AMD is unlikely to overtake Nvidia anytime soon, it's still seeing strong growth and solid progress in the data center space. Meanwhile, while the AI training market has been the early focus of companies as they race to build better AI models, the inference market is eventually expected to become exponentially larger. AMD has always competed better in the inference market, so this eventual shift should be a big positive for the company. While AMD's data center growth in the quarter was a highlight, not everything was coming up roses for the company. It said that it would lose out on around $700 million in revenue in the second quarter due to new export controls that would affect its MI308 GPU shipments to China. For the full year, it expects the export restriction to be a $1.5 billion headwind, with most of the effect in the second and third quarters. Nonetheless, the company still forecasts strong double-digit percentage revenue growth in 2025. For Q2, it projected revenue to be $7.4 billion, plus or minus $300 million, representing 27% growth. Given its potential growth opportunities, AMD also plans to increase investments in its product and technology roadmaps. Turning back to AMD's Q1 results, the company saw overall revenue rise by 36% to $7.44 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 55% to $0.96. The results topped the analyst consensus of EPS of $0.94 on sales of $7.13 billion, as compiled byLSEG. Client and gaming segment revenue rose 28% to $2.9 billion, with client revenue soaring 68% to $2.3 billion. The growth was driven by its new high-end Ryzen CPUs, which saw strength in gaming desktop PCs and AI-powered notebooks. Gaming revenue fell 30% to $647 million due to lower semi-custom revenue. The video game console cycle is pretty long in the tooth at this point, but growth for this segment should skyrocket once new consoles are introduced, likely in late 2027 or 2028. Embedded segment revenue, meanwhile, fell 3% to $823 million. Image source: Getty Images. While the export restrictions on China throw a bit of a wrench in AMD's growth story, the company is otherwise seeing very good momentum in the data center space. It's the market share leader in server CPUs, which should continue to be a solid, growing market. However, the company's biggest long-term opportunity may lie in the growing demand for AI chips focused on inference rather than training. AMD's GPUs have already carved out a solid position in the inference segment, which should help drive growth given that the inference market is expected to surpass training in size over time. With its stock trading at aforward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)of 26.5 times 2025 analyst estimates and at about 18 times 2026 estimates, AMD's valuation has come down a lot over the past year and is now at an attractive level.  AMD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. Given the potential AI opportunities in front of AMD, I think now could be a good time to begin accumulating shares of the stock. If the company can grab market share in the inference market, AMD stock should have a lot of upside from here.",

        "header": "Here Are the 2 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in May and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "If thepromises of some ofartificial intelligence's(AI) biggest champions come true, the technology will fundamentally reshape our world; nothing will be the same. Maybe this won't come to pass. Maybe the tech evangelists have oversold a technology's power once again. The thing is, it doesn't have to live up to the full extent of the hype to still have a massive economic impact. And it's not just tech CEOs making bold claims. The International Monetary Fund believes 40% of global employment will be affected by AI -- and 60% in \"advanced economies\" like the U.S. One of the Big Four accounting firms, PwC, believes AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. But just because a company is involved in AI doesn't make it a good pick. Past technological revolutions have made it clear that when the dust settles, many of what seemed like promising companies get left behind. So, here are my two favorite AI picks in May -- and one to stay away from. Meta Platforms(META-0.91%), the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is uniquely positioned to harness the power of AI. Why? A massive, highly engaged audience that is unmatched. Across its \"family of apps,\" Meta reported more than 3.4 billiondailyactive users this quarter -- up 6% year over year. That sort of audience of captive users means Meta can focus on refining its AI features rather than building an audience from scratch. It's also what makes Meta's core business -- advertising, accounting for 99% of its revenue -- incredibly valuable. The company's top line has grown at a double-digit pace in four of the past five years, and now it's using AI to take that growth further. Meta is deploying the technology to both improve ad targeting and give advertisers creative tools that make their ads more effective and cheaper to produce. In the latest quarter, Meta said these efforts lifted conversion rates by 5% -- a figure that's likely to improve as its AI models mature. Looking ahead, Meta is betting on AI to define the future of how people interact with computing. The company says its Meta Glasses are the \"ideal form factor\" for AI and is developing a voice-based assistant with low latency to power them. If successful, I could see these smart glasses moving from novelty to necessity, even replacing smartphones for many users. Finally, Meta stock happens to be one of the most attractively priced among its big tech peers, trading at 23 times earnings. While that's not necessarily cheap, by tech standards, it's more than reasonable. Image source: Getty Images. No company dominates the AI GPU market likeNvidia(NVDA-0.62%), and the rewards have been massive. Fueled by surging chip sales and continued demand, Nvidia has maintained and even expanded its impressive margins over the last few years -- although these do seem to have found an upper limit in the mid-50s. Its chips are still miles ahead of those from its closest competitors, and its incredible free cash flow means it can spend lavishly on research and development to maintain its edge. Beyond its hardware edge, however, Nvidia's most significant edge may be on the software side. Its CUDA platform, a software layer that allows developers to program GPUs for complex tasks beyond the simple graphics they were created for, is what enables GPUs to be used for AI today. While other software like it exists, CUDA is ubiquitous throughout the industry. Most AI software is designed to work on top of CUDA, making it extremely costly and complex for customers to switch to another hardware provider. They would need to rework their own software to work with that company's CUDA equivalent, likely even needing to hire entirely new developers. That is extremely expensive. This \"stickiness\" ensures that clients remain loyal and willing to pay a premium, reinforcing Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market. There are real hurdles ahead, but I think Nvidia has proven its ability to innovate and adapt, and with its stock trading at one of its lowestprice-to-earnings ratios (P/E)in many years, I thinkNvidia is still a great pick. Palantir Technologies(PLTR-1.49%), an AI-powered intelligence and analytics company, is a great company in almost every way from an investing perspective. It is an innovative company delivering consistent double-digit growth and expanding margins, and the demand for its services remains very high. The value it provides to its clients is undeniable. However, its stock is just too expensive -- and that's putting it lightly. Palantir shares carry a P/E of nearly 500. That's more than 12 times the P/E of Nvidia, which is growing its top and bottom lines at a faster clip. Its valuation is simply divorced from reality, and I would caution you to stay away unless the stock falls significantly.",

        "header": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Many investors are watching large tech companies invest massive capital intoartificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. The big question is when, or even if, there will be an adequate return on those investments. There are even concerns that massive capital allocation plans already announced may be cut or pushed out. But there are more and more signs that spending is continuing and even accelerating. If that indeed remains true, two of the biggest beneficiaries of that spending are no-brainer stocks to buy right now. Image source: Getty Images. Currently, one of the main recipients of that capital isNvidia(NVDA-0.62%). Its high-end chips are filling server stacks in many data centers being built globally. As a result, the AI boom has been of game-changing benefit to Nvidia and its investors. The stock has been under pressure, though, as questions surface about demand from a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, and regulatory headwinds in the form of export restrictions. The concerns related to capital spending may be overblown. Jonathan Gray, chief operating officer of asset managerBlackstone, recently told CNBC: \"I think this trend is powerful. I think it will continue...overall, we still see a ton of demand.\" That's great news for Nvidia investors and supports what large Nvidia customers likeMeta Platforms,Microsoft, andAmazonhave been saying about maintaining, or even growing, their capital spending plans. Export curbs could be more problematic for Nvidia. Management already said Nvidia plans to take $5.5 billion in charges after the Trump administration declared limits to exports and required licensing for Nvidia's H20 AI chip sales to China. That chip was a modified product created specifically to comply with previous regulations for China shipments. China is an important market for Nvidia. Concerns surrounding that business are a big reason why Nvidia shares have declined this year. Sales there represented 13% of total revenue last year. That was down from 17% in theprior fiscal year, though, showing that Nvidia isn't overly reliant on Chinese customers. Recent reports say that President Donald Trump may even be ready to relax AI chip export curbs, too. Just as Biden-era export restrictions are getting ready to go into effect, Trump reportedly will overturn those rules. Potential rules and regulations going forward remain unclear, but the effect on Nvidia's business may already be priced into the stock. The takeaway is thatinvesting in the AI leadershould still make sense, especially as the stock has pulled back this year. With Nvidia's business still flourishing, investors could also look to its biggest supplier for a winning investment right now. Taiwan Semiconductor(TSMC)(TSM0.87%)also considers Nvidia one of its most important customers. TSMC supplies semiconductor products, including microprocessors,graphics processing units (GPUs), microcontrollers, and other specialty and advanced technology packages. Nvidia is one of several big tech companies reliant on TSMC, but the Taiwan-based company has a diverse customer base. It supplied products to more than 500 customers last year. Demand for its services is surging. Revenue soared 42% in the first quarter, and profits surged even more. Net income anddiluted EPS (earnings per share)soared 60% year over year. That rapid growth is expected to continue. Management expects year-over-year revenue to jump another nearly 40% in the current quarter. Yet, as with Nvidia, investors have pushed TSMC shares down by more than 10% year to date. That's led to a very desirable valuation. The stock now trades at aforward price-to-earnings ratiobelow 20. Nvidia and TSMC stocks have both been beaten down due to concerns about slowing growth. Yet based on customer demand and tech companies' recent comments, the rise in AI development hasnot become a bubble. Even if capital spending on data center buildouts does slow, that doesn't present the full picture either. AI also includes software that is likely going to run in almost every device for both consumers and many enterprises. Taking that broader view should make most investors comfortable owning both Nvidia and TSMC at recent valuations.",

        "header": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting. 1 Dirt Cheap Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Stock She Just Bought (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Throughout her tenure as CEO and chief investment officer of Ark Invest, Cathie Wood earned her reputation as an investor by making big bets on emerging technology themes. Some of Ark's largest positions are in high-growth, and arguably speculative names such asTesla,Coinbase,Palantir Technologies, andArcher Aviation. While the companies above are each disruptive in their own right and stand to benefit from the prospects of artificial intelligence (AI), none trade for a particularly bargain valuation. Instead, recent buying activity at Ark suggests Wood has her eyes on the AI chip market. Yet, interestingly, the savvy investor seems to be interested in an alternative opportunity to chip all-starNvidia. Between April 22 and May 1, Wood scooped up more than 212,000 shares ofAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.14%). Let's explore what may have influenced this decision and assess why now looks like a lucrative time for investors to follow Wood's lead. When it comes to semiconductors and data centers, Nvidia is widely seen by investors and Wall Street analysts as the undeniable market leader. Considering that industry estimates suggest that Nvidia has amassedmore than 90% of the market share, it's hard to deny just how dominant the company is. Nevertheless, AMD has quietly built a respectabledata centerbusiness of its own, and I think that is playing a big role in Wood's decision to buy the stock. In the table below, I've summarized AMD's financial results for its data center segment over the last year. Data source: Investor Relations. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, this financial picture may look a tad lumpy. Keep in mind that the semiconductor industry ishighly cyclical, so it's to be expected that companies such as AMD will experience more pronounced levels of demand from time to time. The more important theme here is that AMD's data center business is accelerating sales while widening its operating margins. Image source: Getty Images. Last year, Nvidia generated upwards of $115 billion in revenue just from the data center business. Given its size relative to AMD, you might think that Nvidia's lead is insurmountable. However, the next few years are going to be quite interesting in the chip space. Cloud hyperscalersMicrosoft,Alphabet, andAmazonare all developing their own lines of in-house chips. Furthermore, social media and metaverse behemothMeta Platformsis joining its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers by building its own chips, too. Each of these companies is believed to be major customers of Nvidia, and so the introduction of new chips to the semiconductor market could pose as a serious headwind to the company's growth. On the flip side, AMD is already working with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, andOraclein the data center space -- each of which is deploying AMD's MI300X accelerators. To make things even more interesting, AMD already has a line of successor architectures, with the newMI350 GPUscheduled to make a splash later this year. Year to date, shares of AMD have plummeted by some 37%. I think a big reason for the sell-off is that most growth investors are viewing the AI chip opportunity through a binary lens. In other words, you're either all-in on Nvidia or you think AMD may surpass its rival. I don't personally see things this way. Despite the introduction of both direct and tangential competition, Nvidia will likely continue to be a critical player in the AI infrastructure space for the long run. However, this does not mean that investors should look the other way when it comes to AMD. AMD may never become as large as Nvidia, and that is OK. Right now, AMD stock trades at a modestforward price-to-earnings(P/E) multiple of just 22.4. If the downward trend in AMD's forward P/E suggests anything, it's that investors aren't overly optimistic about the company's future.  AMD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts In my eyes, it's not about AMD building a data center business of the same size or footprint as Nvidia. Rather, the bigger idea is whether or not AMD can scale its current GPU business and do so in a profitable way. If the financial profile above, combined with AMD's notable customer wins, serves as any indication, I'm optimistic that the company's new chipsets should experience strong demand andhelp fuel robust growth for AMD. To me, Wood is making a smart decision to pounce on AMD stock at its current price point. I think investors with a long-term time horizon should consider adding AMD to their AI portfolio.",

        "header": "3 Reasons to Buy This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Quantum Computing Stock on the Dip",
        "content": "When artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as the next big thing a couple of years ago, much of the talking points around the technology revolved around how it would be deployed in corporate environments to enhance productivity, data analytics, and efficiency. While AI certainly lends a hand to these applications, it is capable of far more. Some of the more subtle use cases for AI include process improvements in drug discovery, financial fraud, and cybersecurity. But to achieve major breakthroughs in these areas, today's AI protocols are going to need some enhancements. This is wherequantum computingcomes into play. While quantum computing is not a widely adopted component of AI right now, the opportunity it presents is enormous. Let's explore the quantum computing market and assess which companies are making waves in the space. More importantly, after a thorough analysis of the industry's hottest players, I'll reveal my top disruptor in the quantum computing arena and make the case for why investors should consider buying this stock hand over fist right now. Image source: Getty Images. Management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that thetotal addressable market (TAM)for quantum computing could be as much as $131 billion by 2040. Under the broader quantum computing umbrella, McKinsey sees mobility, life sciences, chemicals, and financial services as four of the biggest opportunities -- set to potentially gain $1.3 trillion in value by the middle of the next decade thanks to quantum computing adoption. Interest in quantum computing started to emerge in the later months of 2024. During that period, relatively unknown names, such asIonQ,D-Wave Quantum,Quantum Computing, andRigetti Computing, began witnessing abnormal buying activity. These dynamics are not uncommon. Oftentimes, when a new trend begins to gain steam, smaller players start to see some momentum -- usually driven by speculation or hype narratives.  IONQdata byYCharts. As the chart above shows, each quantum computing stock I mentioned above is trading well off its prior highs. While this might suggest these once-red-hot stocks are good buys right now, let's check out their valuations.  IONQ PS Ratiodata byYCharts. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio. Despite their precipitous sell-offs, each of the stocks in this peer set still trades for extended valuations. The magnitude of theseprice-to-sales (P/S)multiples underscores that IonQ, Rigetti Computing, Quantum Computing, and D-Wave Quantum aren't generating much in terms of revenue -- yet each company is trading at a valuation near or more than $1 billion. On top of that, none of these companies is on a proven path to generate consistent profitability. Given these valuation dynamics, none of the quantum computing stocks in this cohort are trading at levels that would suggestbuying the dip. Beyond the smaller players, several \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, includingAmazon,Alphabet, andMicrosoft, are quietly competing in the quantum computing arena as well. While each of these companies hasmade impressive inroads into quantum computing, my top pick in the space right now isNvidia(NVDA-0.62%). At the moment, Nvidia is best known for its AI chips, called graphics processing units (GPUs). However, few investors understand that Nvidia also has a software product called CUDA that works in parallel with the GPUs. By tightly integrating both its hardware products with an in-house software service, Nvidia is quickly building an end-to-end platform for enterprise AI infrastructure. Nvidia is parlaying this strategy by adding another stitch to the broader CUDA fabric. Known asCUDA-Q, Nvidia now has a software suite that can work alongside the hardware stack needed to perform sophisticated tasks in quantum computing. Just as Nvidia has become the market leader in the AI chip space, I think the company is going to emerge as a force in the quantum computing industry despite receiving little coverage in the space so far. Similar to the other stocks mentioned in this piece, shares of Nvidia are also trading well off their highs. As of this writing (May 7), Nvidia stock has plummeted 24% off its 12-month high --losing nearly $1 trillion in market capin the process. But unlike IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing, Nvidia stock trades at a reasonable valuation. As seen below, the compression in the company'sforward price to earnings (P/E)multiple could suggest that expectations around Nvidia have either normalized or that growth investors could be souring on the stock.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio. Despite some near-term uncertainty as it pertains to the ongoing tariff situation and Nvidia's prospects in China, I would not write off the company. For now, Nvidia remains in control of the AI chip market, and as explored above, quantum computing represents a longer-term opportunity worth tens of billions of dollars for the company. I think investors with a long-term horizon should consider taking advantage of Nvidia's current depressed price action and buy the stock hand over fist.",

        "content": "Over the last two years,artificial intelligence(AI) has come into focus as the next megatrend. In the capital markets, megacap technology stocks have attracted the lion's share of the attention and hype as it relates to the prospects of AI. But some smaller players are proving they also can compete with big tech. I can't think of a better example of this than enterprise software developerPalantir Technologies(PLTR-1.49%), which has seen its stock soar by 361% over the past year (as of May 6). While Palantir has become one of the most popular AI stocks, smart investors are wondering if the company's parabolic gains in share price can persist. Let's explore its valuation trends and compare these dynamics to share behavior around other important historical events in the technology sector. From there, it should become more clear which direction the stock could be headed. In just one year, Palantir's market capitalization has risen from about $46 billion to more than $250 billion.  PLTR Market Capdata byYCharts. As of this writing, the company'sprice-to-sales ratio(P/S) is about 91. Looking at that figure in isolation doesn't tell us too much, so let's consider it in the context of some notable examples from the tech sector's history. Image Source: Getty Images. A couple of months ago, my fellow Fool.com contributor Sean Williams wrote an astounding articlereferencing valuation trends during the dot-com bubbleand the current AI revolution, and he subsequently indexed those results against Palantir. Prior to thedot-com crash, the price-to-sales ratios of hot names such asCiscoandAmazonpeaked around 40. That's similar to whatNvidiahas experienced throughout the AI boom -- its P/S ratio reached a record of 46 a couple of years ago. Yes, Palantir's P/S is now more than double what some leading tech players have traded at during periods of pronounced stock market euphoria. In that light, it's clear that Palantir's valuation is overstretched. But investors still need to consider what happened in the fallout from the dot-com boom and more recent trends in the AI arena to get a better understanding of where the stock may be headed. As of this writing, Cisco, Amazon, and Nvidia trade at P/S multiples of 4.4, 3.1, and 21.6, respectively. At a high level, I think the historical context here strongly suggests that Palantir's valuation multiples could begin to compress significantly. While such a notion might inspire some panic selling, I wouldn't encourage acting on that emotion. The reason I say that is because it is completely reasonable for valuation multiples to normalize over long time horizons. As companies mature, so do their valuation ratios. In other words, as sales and profits grow over time, so does the market value of the company -- hence, valuation multiples begin to smooth out.  CSCO Market Capdata byYCharts. Moreover, just because valuation multiples begin to compress does not necessarily mean a company's market value will decline. Amazon is a much more valuable enterprise today than it was 26 years ago during the dot-com boom, when its multiples were peaking. While Cisco's valuation never fully recovered, the company's current market cap of $236 billion is still far greater than it was during the mid-2000s. This underscores the idea that holding stocks for the long run (several years or even decades) can lead to outsize gains. Furthermore, Nvidia's market cap is more than twice what it was just two years ago, when its P/S peaked at around 46.  NVDA Market Capdata byYCharts. One of the key differences between Palantir and the examples above is thatI do not think the AI sector is in a bubble. I think Palantir's growth prospects now are much clearer than those of Cisco or Amazon during the dot-com era,\u00a0thanks in large part tosurging demand for AI software. While this suggests its long-run prospects are robust, I would still encourage investors to understand theopportunity costof investing in the company at a historically high valuation. Although history suggests that Palantir could well eclipse its current market value of $250 billion eventually, there is also quite a bit of evidence suggesting that it will be trading at more reasonable prices for new buyers at some point. For investors who want to build a position in it now, I think the best strategy to use would bedollar-cost averaging. And I'd say that to get the most out of that investment, they should be prepared to hold the stock for many years.",

        "content": "Cathie Wood is known for two things: making daring investment moves that go against the crowd and doing this with a focus on the long term. This means Wood might sell a spectacularly popular stock that's soaring and buy shares of a stock that's dropped in recent times. The chief executive officer of ARK Invest does this to get in on innovators -- her favorite type of company -- at a reasonable price. She doesn't mind if the stock struggles in the near term because she aims to stick with the companies in her portfolio throughout their growth stories. Just this week, Wood has done exactly this, and the move concerns three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. AI stocks are right up Wood's alley as the technology promises to revolutionize the way the world works -- and that could represent billions of dollars in revenue for companies that lead the way. This week, Wood cut her holding of one of her favorite stocks -- one that's soared 1,000% over three years -- and added to her positions in two other AI giants. Let's take a closer look at her moves. Image source: Getty Images. So, let's start with the stock Wood sold. This week, during more than one trading session, Wood sold shares ofPalantir Technologies(PLTR-1.49%), a maker of AI-driven software systems. This stock, as of May 9, was the sixth-biggest holding, with a 6% weighting, in her flagshipArk Innovationexchange-traded fund (ETF). Palantir reportedfantastic revenue growthearlier in the week, with a solid balance of growth and profitability, and the company highlighted the strength of demand moving forward. So there wasn't any bad news in the report, but, as a big holder of Palantir, Wood may have decided to lock in some profits to reallocate into other opportunities. On top of this, Palantir shares are pricey today at about 200 times forward earnings estimates, and this could weigh on near-term stock performance. Still, it's clear that with Palantir's significant position in Ark Innovation, Wood still is optimistic about the company's long-term prospects from earnings and share performance perspectives even after the stock has climbed in the quadruple digits over the past three years. Now, let's consider Wood's buys. The top investor added more shares of AI chip designersNvidia(NVDA-0.62%)andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.14%)to Ark Innovation this past week. It's no surprise the bargain-hunting Wood made this move considering the valuations of these players right now. Nvidia trades for 26 timesforward earnings estimates, down from 50 times earlier this year. AMD's valuation decline has been less spectacular, but the stock still looks like a good value today for 25 times forward earnings estimates compared to more than 30 times a few months ago. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, and its fast pace of innovation should keep it in the lead. So anyone, such as Wood, who believes in the AI growth story might view Nvidia as a solid buy at the moment. The company has proven itself by generating record revenue in recent quarters and high profitability on sales, and Nvidia has set out an aggressive product-development roadmap. Meanwhile, AMD also is making progress in the AI chip market, and there's enough room in this industry for this player to be successful without unseating Nvidia. AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said in the recent earnings report that the company delivered \"an outstanding start to 2025.\" Revenue and gross profit both climbed in the double digits, and AMD announced a gross margin of 50%, indicating strong profitability on sales. AMD's strengths in central processing units(CPUs) -- the main processor in standard computers -- as well as its strengths in AI for data center customers have driven this growth. So, what do these latest moves by superstar investor Cathie Wood mean for you as an investor? All three of these AI giants aregreat stocks to ownfor the long term. But of the three, from a valuation perspective, Nvidia and AMD represent the best buying opportunities right now. Considering the pace of AI growth, they may not remain at these valuations for long, so Wood took the opportunity to add to her holdings -- and other AI savvy investors may want to do the same.",

        "header": "Elon Musk Thinks Tesla Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia. Is It Time to Finally Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "Elon Musk likes to make bold claims. Some of these claims come true, but many do not. Recently, he has stated that he believesTesla(TSLA4.66%)can be the most valuable company in the world someday, claiming that it could be worth more than the next five companies combined inmarket capitalization. Today, these stocks such asNvidiaare worth more than $10 trillion in combined market capitalization. Tesla's market cap is under $900 billion, meaning that Elon Musk is claiming that Tesla has a chance to go up by around 10x in price from here. Is he correct, and should you buy Tesla stock today? Let's dig further into Musk's claims and find out. After growing for years, Tesla's automotive business has flat-lined in the last few quarters. In Q1 of this year, deliveries to customers were down 13% year over year to 337,000 while competitors take share in countries around the globe. Automotive revenue slipped 20% year over year, a faster drop than deliveries because of Tesla's huge price cuts implemented on its models. The new Cybertruck vehicle has been a major flop and will not be generating significant sales for the company anytime soon. Profit margins are falling, at 7.4% over the last 12 months, which is leading to a huge dip in earnings power for Tesla. If deliveries keep falling with lower selling prices, Tesla is going to struggle to keep operating margin from falling throughout the rest of this year. The company does not have long-term guidance for 2025, but all forward indicators say that the decline in sales will continue throughout the year. Sales keep falling in China, Europe, and the United States, which are Tesla's largest markets. With no new models on the horizon -- at least from what management has publicly disclosed -- it is hard to paint a pretty picture for Tesla's automotive business in the future. Perhaps it can make some money from the new Cybercab and autonomous vehicle technology, but that is a theoretical future Tesla has been promising for years. It has never deployed a robotaxi, while its competitor Waymo now does 250,000 rides per week. And will it be beneficial enough for Tesla to reach a market cap of $10 trillion? That seems even more unlikely. A person charging a Tesla. Elon Musk's optimism for Tesla at the moment comes from the potential of the Tesla Optimus Robot, a humanoid robot the company is developing. He believes that if these robots have artificial intelligence (AI) software and can perform physical tasks for humans, there is a market for $10 trillion in revenue selling 100 million bots for $100,000 apiece. That is not a typo. While $10 trillion in revenue sounds exciting, these are fantastical claims from the leader of Tesla. Tesla has never built a functioning humanoid robot. The robots at its demonstration were remotely controlled by humans. If it can get a working robot, it is hard to envision demand for 1 million units a year, let alone 100 million. There are only so many corporations and wealthy individuals that would buy these bots every year, if they ever get made in the first place. Of course, Musk can claim as optimistic of a figure as he wants. That does not mean these figures are grounded in economic reality.  TSLA PE Ratiodata byYCharts Investors in Tesla are slowly realizing a hard truth: The stock has been overvalued for years. It traded at just under $300 at the beginning of 2021. Today, it trades below this level at a price of around $275, and it is likely still overvalued. Tesla stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 150. A typical automotive stock will have a P/E closer to 10 (I usedToyota Motorsin the chart above a stand in for the indsutry since most trade around this range). Remember, Tesla's automotive revenue is declining by 20% a year at the moment, with bad forward-looking indicators. Management is promising a lot with the Cybercab and Optimus Bot, but these are not real businesses yet. It would be cool if the company could innovate and pull it off, but that doesn't mean the stock is cheap today. Even with the stock down and Elon Musk saying Tesla could be worth 10x its current market value someday does not mean you should buy the stock. When you peel back the layers of this onion, all I see is a struggling automotive business trading at an expensive P/E ratio. Stay far away from Tesla stock until further notice.",

        "content": "With shares up 1,425% over the last five years,Nvidia(NVDA-0.62%)is the quintessential artificial intelligence (AI) stock, designing the chips other enterprises use to run and train consumer-facing algorithms. However, the company's dominant role has attracted political attention as the technological rivalry between the U.S. and China heats up. Let's discuss how this and other challenges could impact Nvidia's stock price over the next half decade and beyond. Over the next five years, China may have an outsized impact on Nvidia's business. However, it is still unclear whether the Asian nation will be more of a threat or an opportunity. On the surface level, Nvidia's pick-and-shovel business model protects it from much of this uncertainty. The bull thesis is simple: Nvidia can sell chips to anyone. Even if Chinese AI companies outcompete their U.S. rivals on consumer-facing software, they will still rely on Nvidia's hardware to run and train their algorithms. But when we dig a little deeper, the situation isn't so clear-cut. The market reacted negatively to the launch of DeepSeek's R1 model in January (causing Nvidia stock to drop more than 17% in a day). Even though the low-cost Chineselarge language model(LLM) used Nvidia's H20 chips, it demonstrated that companies may not actually need to use Nvidia's most cutting-edge hardware (such as Blackwell GPUs) to keep up in the industry. It also highlighted the risk of potential AI intellectual property theft through a process called distillation, which involves using knowledge from an existing AI model to train a new one. DeepSeek (and other Chinese rivals) have demonstrated that theeconomic moatof American AI companies is much shallower than previously thought. And if Nvidia's top customers are unable to make the profits they expect from their AI investments, they may be less willing to shell out billions on Nvidia's expensive hardware. Over the coming years, China could become a big problem for Nvidia's American clients. But that isn't stopping the chipmaker from trying to service the crucial market, which represents 13% of its $130.5 billion in annual revenue. But that goal will be more easily set than achieved.

On April 6, the Trump administration banned Nvidia from exporting its H20 chips to China, causing a $5.5 billion impairment charge because of canceled purchase agreements and inventory. This move follows a Biden-era ban on its H800 chips specifically designed for this market. Each time a chip is banned, Nvidia loses the ability to recoup the capital used to create it and potentially cedes market share and consumer trust to rivals. Nevertheless, Nvidia isn't giving up. According to CEO Jensen Huang, the Chinese AI market will likely reach $50 billion in the next two to three years, and missing out on it would be a \"tremendous loss.\" According to The Information, the company has already begun developing a China-tailored chip that will comply with the new export controls. Over the next five years, Nvidia may find itself caught between a rock and a hard place. If the company decides to keep making chips for China, it risks incurring more massive impairment charges if the government restricts its exports again. Furthermore, less powerful chips mean it will have to compete at a disadvantage compared to domestic rivals likeHuawei, which are eyeing itsmarket share. Meanwhile, by doing business in China, Nvidia could set the stage for low-cost Chinese AIto eventually outcompete its big-spending American customers. Investors may want to wait for some of this uncertainty to clear up before considering a long-term position in the stock.",

        "content": "For the last few years, companies across the technology sector have witnessed unparalleled gains thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. In particular, semiconductor stocks have experienced outsize gains thanks to the importance chips play in generative AI development. Since ChatGPT was released commercially on Nov. 30, 2022, shares ofNvidia,Broadcom, andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturinghave soared by 592%, 272%, and 110%, respectively. From a broader industry perspective, theVanEck Semiconductor ETFboasts a 93% total return over this same time period. While it's been hard to lose money investing in the semiconductor space over the last two-and-a-half years, there are some notable laggards. Investors inIntel(INTC2.07%)know this all too well, experiencing a 32% decline since ChatGPT's inception jump-started the AI roller coaster. With shares of Intel trading near their lowest level in 15 years, is now an opportunity tobuy the dip? It's important to understand why certain semiconductor stocks have experienced generous gains while others have not. Nvidia, for example, specializes in designing graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are an important piece of hardware that are used to train AI models -- hence, Nvidia is playing an important role in how AI applications are created. On the other hand, Broadcom's expertise surrounds equipping data centers with important pieces of network equipment as well as helping companies design their own custom chipsets. Lastly, Taiwan Semi brings the chips designed by Nvidia,Advanced Micro Devices,Qualcomm, and many others to life through itsmarket-leading foundry services. While Intel is a fairly diversified operation, thefoundry business in particular has been a source for concernover the last couple of years. In 2024, Intel's foundry segment generated $17.5 billion in revenue -- down 7% year over year. In addition, the company's foundry business posted an operating loss north of $13.4 billion last year -- nearly double the losses seen during the prior year. During the first quarter of 2025, Intel generated $4.7 billion of revenue in the foundry segment. While this represented an encouraging 7% gain year over year, investors should be aware that management attributed some of this growth to revenue that was pulled in during the first quarter -- thereby guiding for some deceleration over the coming months. While Intel clearly plays some role in chip development, the company continues to lose market share to Taiwan Semi and can't seem to operate its own foundry practice in a profitable way. Moreover, the growth trends from this segment are, at best, quite unpredictable. Image source: Getty Images. While a plummeting stock price may tempt some investors to buy the dip, I think Intel's sell-off is warranted. Right now, Intel is inturnaround modeand it remains to be seen ifnew leadership has what it takesto right the ship.  INTC Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts Considering Wall Street estimates aren't calling for much in the way of revenue or earnings growth over the next couple of years, I'm hard-pressed to see a bullish narrative around Intel. Given the inconsistency of Intel's foundry business in the face of rising competition -- mainly from TSMC -- I see Intel as a speculative stock to own. For these reasons, I'd pass on buying the stock.",

        "content": "Suppose you think of investing a relatively small amount of money in stocks in a diversified portfolio and are looking to spread risk while gaining upside exposure to an exciting growth theme. In that case, the AI/data center space is a good place to start.Vertiv(VRT-1.61%)nVent(NVT1.28%)may not spring to mind when thinking about how to profit from the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and, in turn, data center spending. However, that observation highlights an opportunity for discerning investors to profit. All three provide crucial solutions and services to data centers and represent hidden ways to play the theme. Vertiv provides digital infrastructure for data centers and communication networks, and its products include power management, switchgear, thermal management, and monitoring and control infrastructure.EmersonElectricsold the company to Tom Gores' private equity company, Platinum Equity, in 2016, which then  brought the company to the market in 2020.  Its executive chairman is former long-term CEO ofHoneywell, David Cote. The company has found itself ideally placed to benefit from the rising interest in data center investment to support application growth, as amply demonstrated by Vertiv's booming backlog growth. That growth continued through the first quarter, with backlog up 10% from the end of 2024. Data source: Vertiv presentations. Chart by author. The strength in its orders and backlog growth encouraged management to raise the midpoint of its full-year organic revenue growth forecast to 18% from a prior estimate of 16% on its recent Q1 earnings call. However, management maintained the midpoint of its profit margin, profit, and cash flow guidance due to uncertainty over tariffs. Still, Vertiv's management and Wall Street analysts expect $1.3 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2025, and Wall Street expects $1.65 billion and $1.79 billion in FCF in 2026 and 2027. With a current market cap of $36.1 billion, Vertiv would trade on 28 times and 22.5 times FCF in 2025 and 2026. That's not outstandingly cheap, but it will look like a good value if the trend toward accelerating AI/data center demand continues. Image source: Getty Images. nVent offers electrical connection and protection solutions to various industrial, commercial, and residential customers. Those end markets include data centers and the power utilities that generate the energy to power them. Management has made a conscious decision to increase the company's exposure to these attractive end markets by divesting its thermal management business in January, and then completing the purchase of the electrical products group business of Avail Infrastructure Solutions  for $975 million. The deal means infrastructure (data solutions and power utilities) now makes up 40% of its portfolio.  It's also the fastest-growing end market for nVent. CEO Beth Wozniak noted that its data solutions organic orders rose at a strong double-digit rate in Q1, compared to mid-single-digit growth for the rest of the business. Ultimately, the strength in data solutions order led to mid-teens growth in organic orders in Q1. Just as with Vertiv, nVent's excellent first quarter encouraged management to raise its full-year sales guidance to organic growth of 5% to 7%, compared to a previous estimate of 4% to 6%. However, unlike Vertiv, nVent's management raised its full-year earnings growth guidance to 22% to 26%, compared to an earlier estimate of 20% to 24%. In addition, these forecasts include an assumption of a negative tariff effect of $120 million. Wozniak was clear that power utilities and data centers are driving nVent's growth when she said: \"As we look at data solutions and power utilities, in particular, here's where we see that growth accelerating.\" Despite fears of a slowdown in data center spending going into earnings season and the possible effect of tariffs on business confidence through April, data center spending remains robust. Wall Street analysts share this view, seeing nVent report $3.09 and $3.46 in earnings per share in 2025 and 2026, with FCF coming in at $406 million and $561 million. Those estimates put nVent on less than 20 times earnings in 2025, 17.4 times earnings in 2026, and 24 times FCF and 17.7 times FCF in 2025 and 2026. These are attractive multiples, and with upside potential, nVent is an excellent stock to buy.",

        "content": "The technology sector has produced some of the biggest winners in the stock market in recent decades, and artificial intelligence (AI) promises big rewards for investors who hold the right stocks. If you have $3,000 to invest right now, the following companies are competitively positioned to deliver excellent returns over the long term, as they already have over the past decade. Splitting your cash equally in these stocks will cover your bases across the hardware and software side of the AI market. Image source: Getty Images. The computing horsepower ofgraphics processing units (GPUs)is essential for training computer models to think and respond to human inquiries in natural language.Nvidia's(NVDA-0.62%)GPUs are the gold standard. The company is experiencing explosive demand that makes the stock's recent dip a great buying opportunity. Nvidia's data center revenue more than doubled last year, and now comprises almost 90% of its business. Investors are counting on the company's new Blackwell computing system to drive an estimated 54% revenue increase for the current fiscal year. Blackwell was designed to bring significant performance improvements over the previous Hopper generation of chips for AI tasks. AI models fromOpenAI,xAI, and others are getting increasingly sophisticated in their ability to solve complicated problems and logically converse with a human on a number of topics. The computational power to improve the next generation of AI models will be up to 100 times more per task, which should benefit Nvidia. Some of Nvidia's customers, including OpenAI, are investing in their own custom AI chips, which poses a risk. This is one reason why Nvidia stock has fallen year to date, but these concerns are likely overblown. Nvidia isn't just selling chips to model makers for specific workloads. Its GPUs can be used for a wide variety of computing purposes. For example, the Mayo Clinic is building a state-of-the-art digital pathology lab to speed up the diagnosis and treatments in healthcare using Nvidia's DGX computing platform. Nvidia offers solutions like this for several industries, which is a competitive advantage. This advantage can be seen by its stellar profit margin. Last year, Nvidia earned $73 billion innet incomeon $130 billion of revenue. The consensus analyst estimate has the company's earnings growing at an annualized rate of 35% over the next few years. These prospects makeNvidia stockan attractive value at current share prices, trading at just 26times this year's earningsestimate. Companies are increasingly turning to thecloudand AI services to improve productivity, andMicrosoft(MSFT0.07%)is one of the top providers they are turning to. It's a top brand in software, with more than 1 billion devices running Windows. The company's latest quarterly update shows it gaining momentum. Microsoft's revenue grew 15% year over year on a constant-currency basis last quarter, with earnings up 19%. Growth was driven across every segment, most notably in the cloud, with Microsoft Azure posting an impressive 35% year-over-year increase. AI has become an essential investment by big businesses, as AI services contributed nearly half of Azure's growth last quarter. This is more than double the revenue contribution of AI just a year ago. Microsoft saw accelerating demand, noting thatAbercrombie & Fitch,Coca-Cola, andServiceNowrecently expanded their business with Azure. Microsoft stock sold off earlier this year, as the company's earnings growth didn't meet the expectations implied by its premium valuation. However, the largest data center operators, including Microsoft, are in a great position to meet growing demand for AI services over the long term. These large tech giants have massive resources to invest in technology, which is widening their competitive moats. Microsoft reported that hundreds of thousands of customers across industries are using its Copilot AI assistant. This is up threefold from this time last year, and management says the size of new Copilot deals for enterprises continues to grow. Microsoftis a no-brainer tech stock to buy and hold. It's rock-solid financially, with $96 billion generated in net income on $270 billion of revenue over the last year. Analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 12%, which should lead to comparable shareholder returns.",
