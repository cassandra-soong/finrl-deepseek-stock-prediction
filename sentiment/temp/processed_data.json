        "content": "By Wen-Yee Lee TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia is evaluating how to address the China market after the U.S. government placed limits on sales of its Hopper H20 chip there but will not put out another version from the Hopper series, CEO Jensen Huang said on Saturday. Asked what their next chip for China after the H20 was, he said: \"It's not Hopper because it's not possible to modify Hopper anymore,\" Huang said, according to a livestream posted by Taiwan's Formosa TV News network. Huang, who has consistently said China is critical to Nvidia's growth, made a visit to China immediately after the U.S. placed new restrictions on China-bound shipments of its H20 chips, the only AI chip the company can sell legally in China. Reuters reported earlier this month that Nvidia plans to release a downgraded version of the H20 chip for China in the next two months, as it seeks to prop up sales in the country, where it has lost market share to domestic rivals such as Huawei. The U.S. Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, issued in January just a week before the end of former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, aimed to limit AI chip exports to most countries. Huang also said that previous AI export regulations were wrong and should have been focused on maximising U.S. technology globally. Trumphas said he will cancel the AI diffusion rules that were introduced by the Biden administration. China generated $17 billion in revenue for Nvidia in the fiscal year ending January 26, accounting for 13% of the company's total sales. (Reporting by Wen-Yee Lee; Editing by Sam Holmes)",

        "content": "With the market settling down and trade tensions easing (for now), let's look at fourartificial intelligence (AI)stocks that investors might want to consider buying right now. These are all leading tech companies with solid opportunities ahead. While much of the focus on AI has been on infrastructure and building out AI models,Palantir Technologies(PLTR1.00%)has taken an approach that helps differentiate it from the pack. Its priority has been on the applications and workflow layers of AI, where it collects information from different sources and structures it into an \"ontology,\" linking data to real-world objects and processes. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) then works as an orchestration layer to help its customers use AI to solve real-world problems. It has also recently introduced AI agents within AIP that help automate decisions and drive action. The company's solution can be used for numerous applications across industries, giving it a huge market opportunity. Its solutions are also used within the U.S government, which is its largest customer, to help with mission-critical tasks. Its ability to help reduce costs and create efficiencies makes it a long-term winner that will eventually replace older, outdated systems, aligning it with the stated mission of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). A recent deal with NATO, meanwhile, adds yet another growth leg to the Palantir story. Overall, Palantir has one of the best long-term opportunities in front of it. Image source: Getty Images. If there were any concerns that AI infrastructure expansion was slowing down, President Donald Trump's recent deal with Saudi Arabia should help ease those fears. As part of the deal,Nvidia(NVDA0.28%)is set to ship billions of dollars worth of its new Blackwellgraphics processing units (GPUs)to Saudi Arabia AI start-up Humain. Previously, Trump also led the way with Project Stargate, where a consortium led by OpenAI andSoftBankagreed to spend $500 billion building out AI data centers in the U.S. over the next few years. Combine those projects with the massive AI infrastructure spending fromcloud computingcompanies, as well as tech companies racing to build out AI models, such asMeta Platformsand xAI, and there is a lot of AI data center spending still going on. Data infrastructure spending, meanwhile, is the biggest driver of Nvidia's growth. The company is the dominant player in GPUs, which are the main chips being used to run AI workloads. It's taken an over 80% market share in this massive market in large part due to its CUDA software program, which makes it easy for developers to program its chips and includes a collection of AI libraries and tools to accelerate the performance of its chips when running AI tasks. As long as AI infrastructure spending continues to be strong, Nvidia will be a winner. Salesforce(CRM0.09%)helped revolutionize the software industry as one of the first major companies to introduce thesoftware-as-a-service (SaaS)model. Today, it is looking to continue with its innovation path by working to become a leader inagentic AI. Through its new Agentforce platform, the company has integrated AI agents throughout its ecosystem that can automatically perform tasks with little to no human interaction. Salesforce's platform includes pre-built AI agents that can help businesses streamline tasks in such areas as customer service, marketing, and sales. The company has also launched an AI agent marketplace with over 200 partners to broaden use cases. In addition, the platform includes no-code and low-code tools that let customers design their own custom AI agents with little technical expertise. With a consumption-based product that costs $2 per conversation, Salesforce has a large opportunity in front of it if its AI agents can prove that they boost productivity and create cost savings. Thus far, the product has seen a nice reception, with more than 3,000 paid deals in place since its launch in October. Online vision board platform providerPinterest(PINS1.01%)has been using AI to help successfully transform its platform into one that better engages its user base and makes it more shoppable. This has helped it both increase its number of users and well as better monetize them. But it's not finished yet. The company developed a multimodal AI model trained on both images and text that can better interpret user intent and provide better personalized recommendations. This also allowed it to upgrade to visual search that lets users highlight a specific element within a pinned image to search for similar items based on visual or stylistic characteristics. Its visual searches can also include links directly to a retailer's checkout page for an item. These are powerful tools that have caught the attention of brands and merchants. On the back end, meanwhile, it has introduced its Performance+ solution, which integrates AI-powered advertiser tools and new bidding functionalities, to help advertisers improve campaign performance and conversion rates. Pinterest has a huge user base, and the company is just at the beginning of better monetizing them with the help of AI, making this a solid long-term investment.",

        "header": "Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got Good News From the Trump Administration",
        "content": "Semiconductor companyNvidia(NVDA0.28%)has been a shining star of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The stock has advanced more than 800% since January 2023, and the Trump administration's recent decision not to enforce the so-called Framework for AI Diffusion could lead to more share price appreciation. Image source: Getty Images. The Commerce Department during the final days of the Biden administration announced the Framework forArtificial Intelligence(AI) Diffusion, far-reaching rules that limited or prevented the sale of advancedsemiconductorsin most countries, including some United States allies. Importantly, the AI Diffusion framework expanded on previously imposed export controls by dividing countries into three tiers with varying degrees of access to U.S. technology: Nvidia slammed the AI Diffusion rule in a blog post: Built on American technology, the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad. That global progress is now in jeopardy. The Biden administration now seeks to restrict access to mainstream computing applications with its unprecedented and misguided 'AI Diffusion' rule, which threatens to derail innovation and economic growth. The AI Diffusion rule was set to take effect on May 15, 2025, but the Trump administration this week chose to scrap the framework. The Commerce Department said the AI Diffusion rule would have stifled American innovation and undermined diplomatic relations with dozens of countries. Instead,Citigroupanalysts think the Trump administration will negotiate export rules on a country-by-country basis. President Trump recently toured the Middle East, during which a number of U.S. technology companies struck deals with Saudi Arabia that would been complicated or prohibited by the Biden administration's AI Diffusion framework. Nvidia is one of those companies, but the list also includesAMD,Alphabet,Amazon, andSuper Micro Computer. Nvidia and Saudi Arabian company Humain will collaborate to build AI data centers. The initial phase will involve 18,000 Nvidia Grace Blackwell superchips -- which combine GraceCPUsand BlackwellGPUs-- andInfiniBand networking. Additionally, Humain will deploy Nvidia's Omniverse simulation software to test physical AI solutions. Nvidia will also collaborate with the Saudi Data & AI Authority (SDAIA), a government agency that aims to position Saudi Arabia as a global leader in artificial intelligence. SDAIA will deploy 5,000 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs to build a sovereign AI factory, meaning secure data center infrastructure not controlled by foreign countries. Importantly, many investors had largely written off the Middle East as a significant source of GPU demand due to the AI Diffusion rules. So, the recent rescission is good news for Nvidia shareholders because it opens a new market for the company. But Nvidia is still facing headwinds. Most notably, the Trump administration recentlyrestricted the sale of H20 GPUs to China. Wall Street is overwhelmingly optimistic where Nvidia is concerned. Among the 69 analysts who follow the company, 87% have a buy rating on the stock and the median target price is $160 per share. That implies 18% upside from the current share price of $135. Importantly, Wall Street's consensus estimate says Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase 46% over the next four quarters. That makes the current valuation of 45 times earnings look quite reasonable, especially because the company beat the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 7% in the last four quarters. Patient investors who want more exposure to Nvidia should consider buying a few shares today.",

        "header": "3 Simple ETFs to Buy With $1,000 and Hold for a Lifetime",
        "content": "Are you looking to build a worry-free, passive long-term portfolio that will allow you to focus on other things while growing your money? Buying and holding a handful of exchange-traded funds (or ETFs) is the answer, of course, and theSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(SPY0.65%)remains a top choice. If you're truly looking for lifetime holdings though, you may want to consider a slightly different solution that allows you to adjust your overall allocation as time marches on. Namely, you'll want to buy a handful of different (but complementary) ETFs that can be individually scaled back or added to as your risk tolerances change. If you have $1,000 in cash available to invest that isn't needed for monthly bills, to pay off short-term debt, or to bolster an emergency fund, here's a combination of ETFs to consider that will likely set most investors up for a lifetime of strong performance. Image source: Getty Images. If this really is going to be a \"forever\" portfolio, it's a reasonably safe bet that growth is a priority for most of the time frame in question. TheVanguard Growth ETF(VUG0.50%)will handle this part of the overall job nicely. Just as the name suggests, the Vanguard Growth ETF holds a basket ofgrowth stocks. The fund currently holds significant stakes inApple,Microsoft, andNvidia... some of the market's top-performing growth names of late. Although this company weighting evolves over time as some companies' market caps outgrow others, this ETF gives you a great shot at major long-term capital gains.  Data byYCharts. There's a very particular reason, however, you might want to own the Vanguard Growth ETF instead of seemingly similar alternatives like theInvesco QQQ Trust, which holds many of the same stocks. That's the fact that this fund is meant to mirror theCRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index. (CRSP stands for the Center for Research in Security Prices.) That won't mean much to most people. This might get your attention though: The CRSP Large Cap Growth Index largely sidesteps the common problem of taking on too much exposure to the market's very biggest companies, which in turn leaves investors vulnerable to sizable setbacks once the tide finally turns against these top names. That hardly makes it an\"equal weight\" index, to be clear -- it's still measurably top-heavy. The fund is top-heavy to a degree that's tolerable and even a little desirable, however, by virtue of ensuring a little bit of overexposure to companies that are becoming much bigger due to actual top- and bottom-line growth. Growth stocks aren't the only way for your portfolio to achieve net growth, of course. It can also be done by a slow and steady (and ever-rising) flow of fresh cash into the account, which is then used to purchase more of whatever's generating that income. For some investors, that will be bonds and other fixed-income instruments. For most people though, this income will come from dividend-paying stocks. The irony? High-qualitydividend-paying stocksoften end up outgaining the broad market anyway. Mutual fund company Hartford crunched the numbers, determining that since 1973, stocks of companies that were able and willing to consistently grow their dividend payments produced average annual net gains of more than 10% (assuming reinvestment of those dividends) while stocks that didn't dish out any dividends didn't perform half as well. Moreover, reliable dividend payers were the market's least volatile stocks during this stretch, making them easier to stick with during turbulent times.  Data byYCharts. What gives? The best explanation is the argument that quality always eventually shines through, and a reliably growing dividend is a good sign that a company is solid and well-run. Although there's certainly the occasional exception to this norm -- think non-dividend-paying Nvidia -- identifying these exceptions isn't always easy. You should invest based on your best odds, particularly when you're thinking in terms of a lifetime. TheSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF(SCHD0.61%)is arguably the best way to plug into this dividend-driven dynamic. Based on theDow Jones U.S. Dividend 100\u2122 Index, this ETF doesn't simply hold what appear to be the market's most promising dividend stocks. In addition to requiring at least 10 consecutive years of annual dividend increases, inclusion in this index also considers fundamental factors like free cash flow versus debt, return on equity, and its typical dividend growth rate. Each prospective constituent is then ranked on these metrics to screen out all tickers other than the best 100 names. While this approach seems quite mechanical, that's the reason it works so well. There's no misleading emotion, presumption, or bias built into the selection and rebalancing process. Finally, add theiShares U.S. Technology ETF(IYW0.17%)to your list of ETFs to buy and hold for a lifetime if you've got $1,000 -- or any other amount of money -- you'd like to put to work for a while. It's obviously different than either of the other two exchange-traded funds suggested here, both of which represent a unique investing school of thought. A sector-based fund is more strategically precise, calling into question whether or not it's actually capable of being a true lifetime holding. And maybe it isn't. It would be shocking, however, if thetechnology sectorwasn't a great one to plan on holding for the long haul, even if you can't fully see its future.  Data byYCharts. Think about it. Ever since personal computers began proliferating back in the late 1990s, the world has increasingly become digitized. Automobiles have them on board, and people would struggle to function without the mini mobile computer they now carry around in their pocket or purse. Artificial intelligence is now being used by the pharmaceutical industry to discover, design, and digitally test new drugs. Factories are made more efficient by being able to instantly share and create actionable data. At the heart of all of it is technology, and now that we've seen what it can do, we're certainly not going back to the \"old way\" that was less efficient and less effective. Now, one of the world's most commonly asked questions is: How can we use technology to make things even better? There's more than one exchange-traded fund that would fit this bill, but the iShares U.S. Technology ETF is arguably the best all-around prospect thanks to how it weights its holdings. Built to mirror the performance of theRussell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index, this fund -- like the aforementioned Vanguard Growth ETF -- at least attempts to maintain a reasonably balanced allocation even when the market itself is becoming top-heavy thanks to the ongoing growth of a small handful of massive companies. As Russell explains in a factsheet on the index, \"At the quarterly index reviews, all companies that have a weight greater than 4.5% in aggregate are no more than 45% of the index, and no individual company in the index has a weight greater than 22.5% of the index.\" This approach doesn't always perfectly accomplish its goal. Right now, for instance, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple collectively account for about 45% of the index's value. That's not particularly well balanced. The weighting rules will help more often than not in the long run though, and will certainly help more often than they hurt.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) plans to help develop a massive new data center in the United Arab Emirates that may eventually be one of the largest in the world, a major bet on the Middle East and a significant expansion of the company\u2019s global AI infrastructure ambitions.

OpenAI\u2019s participation is not yet finalized, said the people, but a formal announcement may come in the near term. Oracle Corp (ORCL). is also involved in the project, two people said, and will help develop at least part of the first phase of the Abu Dhabi campus. Once completed, the sprawling facility would cover 10 square miles and use roughly as much power as five nuclear reactors \u2013 far larger than any site the ChatGPT maker or its closest rivals have announced to date. Not all of the 5 gigawatts will go to OpenAI, one person said, but rather be shared by multiple firms. Bloomberg News previously reported that OpenAI was weighing a facility in the UAE. US and UAE officials said Thursday that G42, the Abu Dhabi-based AI company with historic ties to China, would be building a 5-gigawatt data center in collaboration with several unnamed US companies. The news came the same day that President Donald Trump visited the country as part of his dealmaking tour of the Middle East. Officials on the ground were still in negotiations about potential AI deals for the UAE during the president\u2019s visit. MGX, an Abu Dhabi investment vehicle, is also considering participating in the data center project alongside OpenAI and G42, one person said. Other US partners may get involved too, the person said. OpenAI declined to comment, while Oracle did not respond to an email seeking comment. Representatives for G42, MGX and the US Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment. The planned campus is part of OpenAI\u2019s Stargate initiative to support AI development, two people said. OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle announced Stargate alongside Trump in January, and said the joint venture would invest up to $500 billion in US projects over the next four years. Earlier this month, OpenAI said it was looking to partner with international governments to develop more AI data centers beyond the US and promote American leadership in the field. With the UAE project, OpenAI will effectively help the Middle East rapidly gain ground in offering the infrastructure needed for AI services \u2013 and also achieve an ambitious goal that the company had originally set for the US. Late last year, OpenAI pitched the Biden administration on the need for data centers with capacity as high as 5 gigawatts \u2014 an unprecedented target that raised questions about how to power such facilities. Now it\u2019s participating in a project of a similar scale abroad before getting a comparably sized one off the ground in the US. OpenAI\u2019s first Stargate campus in the US is expected to be 1.2 gigawatts. The company also plans to build as many as 10 more sites on American soil. Related: Trump\u2019s Mideast Visit Spurs Flood of AI Deals Led by Nvidia The UAE data center campus is the focal point of a broader bilateral framework to facilitate more AI collaboration between the US and UAE. The accord could involve the sale of more than a million high-end Nvidia Corp. chips to the Gulf nation. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader strategy to accelerate the use of American technology in AI development throughout the world \u2014 with the aim of preventing China from capturing Middle Eastern and other markets. But some officials in the Trump administration are worried about the strategic implications of what they consider an offshoring of American AI capabilities, according to people familiar with the matter. The officials have also raised national security concerns about sharing advanced US semiconductors, the gold standard for developing and training AI models, with companies and countries that have deep China ties, Bloomberg News has reported. OpenAI has had a long relationship with the UAE, dating back to a 2023 partnership with G42. MGX participated in OpenAI\u2019s $6.6 billion funding round that closed in October and also plans to contribute to Stargate.

In his blog post, Yardeni highlighted the positive market response to Trump\u2019s recent state visits across the Middle East, where U.S. companies have secured major deals in both tech and aerospace. During a stop in Qatar, Trump announced a massive 160-jet order by Qatar Airways fromBoeing Co(NYSE:BA), calling it the largest in the company\u2019s history. Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang unveiled plans to sell more than 18,000 of the company\u2019s most advanced AI chips to local startup Humain, which also struck deals with Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS during Trump\u2019s regional tour. \u201cInvestors are much happier now that President Donald Trump seems to be pivoting from pushing prohibitive tariffs to pushing American semiconductors and Boeing jets,\u201d Yardeni wrote. The shift comes as semiconductor stocks stage a powerful recovery. The S&P Semiconductors Select Industry, which dropped 35.1% from its January high to an April low, has since rebounded 43.6%, now just 6.8% below its peak. Yardeni attributes part of the rebound to easing fears of a datacenter glut and fresh momentum from Middle Eastern AI infrastructure spending. He also noted that forward earnings for the semiconductor industry have climbed to new record highs, reinforcing his firm\u2019s overweight recommendation on Information Technology\u2014alongside Communication Services, Financials, and Industrials.

        "content": "Although the market had a strong week, plenty of stocks still look like phenomenal buys. I'm focusing on three right now:Nvidia(NVDA0.28%),Taiwan Semiconductor(TSM-0.13%), andAlphabet(GOOG1.16%)(GOOGL1.32%). Although each of these stocks may have rallied over the past week, their gains will be nothing compared to the long-term stock performance that's in store for this trio. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia makesgraphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely deployed in applications that require significant computing power, such as artificial intelligence (AI) model training. Nvidia's market share in the data center GPU market is astonishing, with most estimates pegging Nvidia's market share above 90%. Additionally, over the past 12 months, Nvidia has generated $115 billion in sales from its data center division. Considering that Nvidia's overall revenue over the past 12 months was $130.5 billion, Nvidia's performance is heavily tied to data center buildouts. While some investors are worried that data center buildouts may slow, all big tech companies have committed to record-setting capital expenditures in 2025, most of which will be deployed in data center builds. A third-party estimate Nvidia cited stated that data center buildouts totaled $400 billion in 2024. However, that figure is expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. That's incredible growth, and if it turns out to be true, there's still massive upside for Nvidia's stock if it maintains its market share dominance. This is still the early innings of AI deployment and workload migration to the cloud. As a result, there's still a ton of data center capacity to build, which is excellent news for Nvidia. With that in mind, Nvidia is a stock that I want to buy and hold for years to come. Taiwan Semiconductor (or TSMC) makes chips for Nvidia and nearly every other big tech company. These clients can't manufacture their own semiconductors, so they farm out that work to foundries like TSMC. Nobody has the long-term history of continuous innovation and execution like this company, so it has cemented its place as a valuable partner for these companies for the foreseeable future. Management is incredibly bullish on the future. They expect AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with overall company revenue increasing at nearly a 20% CAGR. Many companies place chip orders years in advance, so when TSMC's management speaks about future growth, investors would be wise to listen. However, one glaring issue with TSMC is that most of its fabrication facilities are outside U.S. borders, making it a potential target for Trump administration tariffs. While this is a valid concern, investors must be aware of other issues. First, semiconductors arecurrently exempt from reciprocal tariffs. Second, TSMC management unveiled plans to invest $100 billion in chip production facilities in the U.S. This may be key to staying out of the crosshairs of a tariff, as President Donald Trump's ultimate goal is to increase domestic chip production capacity. The growth that TSMC is expected to put up is undeniable, and with the ball rolling toward getting more U.S. capacity up and running, tariffs aren't as much of a concern. Last is Alphabet, which is trading for an absurdly low price tag. At just17 times forward earnings, Alphabet's stock is among the cheaper stocks in the market.  GOOGL PE Ratiodata byYCharts There are multiple reasons for Alphabet's cheap price tag. First, Alphabet's primary business is advertising, which tends to be negatively affected when the economic outlook is uncertain or negative. Second, investors are worried that Alphabet's primary cash cow, the Google search engine, could be replaced by generative AI models. Last, Alphabet has been found guilty of operating an illegal monopoly in its search engine and advertising platform businesses. That's not a great setup for Alphabet's stock, and the market is assuming the worst-case scenario outcome for all three of these problems. I think that's the wrong way to view the stock, as advertising revenue always comes back following a downturn. Alphabet is already integrating AI summaries into its Google search results, and the court case could take years to wrap up. When all these factors are considered, I think the pessimism is excessive, and investors are ignoring a great business that's still growing at a double-digit pace. As a result,I think investors are fine with taking a position in Alphabet here, as the pessimism is far too great.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.

Its latest flagship products are sold as multimillion-dollar integrated systems, which can contain as many as 72 graphics processing units and 36 processors. The Biden administration set up so-called AI diffusion rules to prevent shipments to other countries being diverted to China, which President Donald Trump has decided to cancel. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of any AI chip diversion. These are massive systems. The Grace Blackwell system is nearly two tons, and so you\u2019re not going to be putting that in your pocket or your backpack anytime soon,\u201d Huang, 62, said. \u201cThe important thing is that the countries and the companies that we sell to recognize that diversion is not allowed and everybody would like to continue to buy Nvidia technology. And so they monitor themselves very carefully.\u201d Huang spoke days after joining a US delegation to the Middle East led by the president, lauding the opening up of trade of Nvidia\u2019s hardware. The scrapping of the Biden-era rules will help the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia acquire more of Nvidia\u2019s industry-leading technology and expand their capabilities in artificial intelligence. \u201cWith proper forecasting, we would be able to build the necessary technologies for everyone,\u201d Huang said on Saturday, after being asked if he\u2019d now have to prioritize Middle East clients. The issue of Nvidia AI chip shipments and whether any of them violate US trade sanctions on China has led to a probe in Singapore, and remains a live topic of concern. Huang reiterated his opposition to trade limitations. \u201cLimiting American technology around the world is precisely wrong,\u201d Huang said, welcoming Trump\u2019s new measures. \u201cIt should be maximizing American technology around the world.\u201d --With assistance from Naman Tandon.

        "header": "Is Super Micro Computer Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(SMCI5.00%), more commonly known as Supermicro, went on a wild ride over the past year. The maker of artificial intelligence (AI) servers closed at a record split-adjusted high of $118.81 on March 13, 2024, which marked a 1,020% gain over the previous 12 months. At the time, investors were impressed by its brisk sales of liquid-cooled AI servers, which ran onNvidia's high-end data center graphics processing units (GPUs). But today, Supermicro trades at about $47. Image source: Getty Images. Supermicro lost its luster as it struggled with a delayed 10-K filing due to accounting issues, the departure of its auditor, delisting threats, and regulatory probes. Its slowing growth and declining gross margins also indicated it was losing its pricing power against its larger competitors. The company finally hired a new auditor, filed its overdue 10-K this February, dodged a delisting, and seemed to placate the regulators. But its growth is still cooling off as the macro and competitive headwinds intensify across the evolvingAI market. So should investors still buy its stock today? Supermicro is still an underdog in traditional servers compared to market leaders likeHewlett Packard EnterpriseandDell Technologies. But it carved out a niche with its dedicated AI servers, andRaymond Jamesestimates it now controls about 9% of that growing market. Its close relationship with Nvidia also gave it access to a steady supply of top-tier data center GPUs. Supermicro's revenue surged 46% in its fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022), 37% in fiscal 2023, and 110% in fiscal 2024. Its gross margin expanded from 15.4% in fiscal 2022 to 18% in fiscal 2023 as the AI market heated up. But its gross margin declined to 14.1% in fiscal 2024 as it faced tougher competition and relied on aggressive pricing strategies to sell more servers. Over the past year, its revenue growth continued to cool off as its gross margins shrank. Metric Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Q3 2025 Revenue growth (YOY) 201% 144% 180% 55% 19% Gross margin 15.5% 11.2% 13.1% 11.8% 9.6% Data source: Supermicro. YOY = year-over-year. Many of its customers postponed their new AI server purchases in anticipation of Nvidia's next-gen Blackwell chips, while supply chain constraints made it harder to fulfill its existing orders. The macro headwinds exacerbated that pressure by forcing many companies to rein in their spending on pricey AI servers. As a result, its inventory levels rose, its pricing power waned, and its gross margins contracted. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Supermicro expects its revenue to grow at a midpoint of 13% year over year as it ramps up its production of Blackwell-powered servers and data center building block solutions -- which bundle its AI servers and software for quick deployments. For the full year, it expects its revenue to rise 46% to 51%. That outlook is still impressive, but it was scaled back from its prior outlook for 57% to 67% growth. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 48% in fiscal 2025, 36% in fiscal 2026, and 25% in fiscal 2027. We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but investors shouldn't expect it to grow as rapidly as it did over the past three years. That slowdown wouldn't be surprising, since Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell, and other major server makers have been rolling out more dedicated AI servers for the booming market. Supermicro established an early mover's advantage in the space, but it doesn't have much of a moat against those rivals. Supermicro still faces a lot of macro and competitive challenges, but it also looks like a bargain at 18 times next year's earnings. The AI server market could still have a compound annual growth rate of 34.3% from 2024 to 2030, according to MarketsandMarkets Research, so there could be plenty of room for Supermicro, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Dell to grow without trampling one another. If you believe Supermicro can defend its niche with its high-end liquid-cooled servers, its stock might be worth accumulating as it trades far below its all-time highs. But investors should watch its gross margins closely to see if it can maintain its pricing power in this tough market.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- One thing is clear as the first-quarter earnings season draws to a close: The uncertain outlook for the global economy is superseding better-than-feared results even as stocks rally on signs of easing trade tensions. Most Read from Bloomberg As Coastline Erodes, One California City Considers \u2018Retreat Now\u2019 How a Highway Became San Francisco\u2019s Newest Park Maryland\u2019s Credit Rating Gets Downgraded as Governor Blames Trump NJ Transit Train Engineers Strike, Disrupting Travel to NYC America, \u2018Nation of Porches\u2019 Corporations across the US, Europe and China are pulling their forecasts for the year or providing grim outlooks, citing rising costs, weak consumer sentiment and a lack of business confidence as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s worldwide trade offensive. \u201cThis earnings season wasn\u2019t about the numbers, it was about the narrative,\u201d said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments LLC. \u201cNobody cared what you did in the first quarter other than to determine the jumping off place for the new tariff economy.\u201d In the US, a measure that reflects the proportion of S&P 500 Index members that raised their earnings outlook compared to those that held or reduced, the so-called profit guidance momentum, fell to the lowest level since at least 2010, according to an analysis from Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s equity strategists Gina Martin Adams and Wendy Soong. That is in spite of S&P 500 companies delivering double the profit growth that was expected in the first quarter, according to BI. Meanwhile in Europe, analysts\u2019 expectation for 2025 earnings growth has slowed by the sharpest since the Covid pandemic, BI found, even as MSCI Europe constituents posted a 5% earnings increase, beating an expected 1.5% decline. Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Kaidi Meng said shares of European firms that issued gloomy outlooks this earnings season tended to trail the broader Stoxx 600 on the day, suggesting the tariff impact hasn\u2019t been fully priced in yet. And in China, earnings projections for the benchmark CSI 300 Index have fallen 1.7% from a peak around the end of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors were in for a rude awakening as they were expecting outlooks to turn around in the first quarter, but Trump\u2019s tariff blitz complicated the nascent recovery in corporate profits. \u201cWe are in a more wait-and-see mode for China\u2019s earnings picture, especially since domestic inflation is still quite low and suggestive of continued downward pressures on corporate pricing power,\u201d said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier. To be sure, stocks have been on an epic rebound rally, helped largely by a temporary detente of US-China trade tensions. The S&P 500 has surged 20% from a low touched on April 8, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index has climbed 14% over the same period, and the Stoxx 600 Index has risen 17% from its own low on April 9. \u201cCompanies are doing what they should \u2014 planning for different scenarios under different tariff and economic regimes, and investors are rewarding both prudent managements and companies that have lower exposure to tariffs and have secular earnings growth power,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and quantitative strategist at Evercore ISI. Tariff Bite No industry has been safe from the looming threat of higher tariffs \u2014 from retailers, airlines and travel companies, to industrial manufacturers, medical device firms and chocolate makers. The world\u2019s largest retailer Walmart Inc. said it may soon need to raise prices, farm equipment company Deere & Co. expects levies to have a $500 million impact on costs in fiscal 2025, and Expedia Group Inc. said it expects travel demand in the US to be weak. China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \u2014 a barometer of the country\u2019s consumer economy \u2014 reported feeble revenue growth, and Germany\u2019s Daimler Truck Holding AG lowered its sales and profit guidance for the year, flagging weaker orders in North America and higher parts costs from tariffs. A Bloomberg analysis of S&P 500 and Stoxx 600 earnings calls shows tariff mentions spiked to a record high this season, and were much higher than Trump\u2019s first trade war in 2018. The lack of clarity on how the trade situation will shake out, pushed companies to take unusual measures. United Airlines Holdings Inc. issued two profit forecasts, one in case the environment remains stable, and another if there\u2019s a recession. The other two major US carriers \u2014 Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. \u2014 withdrew their guidances for the year. Automaker Mercedes-Benz Group AG also pulled its 2025 outlook, citing tariff uncertainty. Meanwhile, executives at some companies, such as retailer JD Sports Fashion Plc, declined to answer questions on levies. \u201cAnything we say now will be misleading or could be misleading,\u201d JD Sports Chief Executive Officer Regis Schultz said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts last month. Resilient Tech Still, the one bright spot this period was the relatively strong showing from technology companies, especially expensively valued artificial intelligence firms. The Magnificent Seven companies\u2019 results allayed fears of a tariff-induced profit slump. Of the six in the group that have reported so far, four provided revenue forecasts that are either roughly in line or better than analysts\u2019 expectations. Google parent Alphabet Inc. did not provide one, and Nvidia Corp. is scheduled to announce results on May 28. For Aaron Clark, partner at GW&K Investment Management, the biggest takeaway of first-quarter earnings was the resilience of the AI-hyperscalers, which to him is a \u201crisk-on signal.\u201d In Europe, results from the tech behemoths were mixed. Chip-equipment maker ASML Holding NV\u2019s bookings disappointed even as the company said AI-related demand remains strong. On the other hand, German software company SAP SE signaled resilient demand for its cloud-based software despite growing trade uncertainties. --With assistance from Zhu Lin.

        "content": "It\u2019s been a year of such extremes on Wall Street that even volatility measures have been historically volatile. TheCboe Volatility Index(VIX), otherwise known as \u201cthe fear index,\u201d closed above 40 for the first time since 2020 in early April when President Trump sent the stock market intoa tailspinwith his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Then, starting on April 9, when Trumppaused most of those tariffsfor 90 days, the VIX began a rapid descent. From the close on April 10 to May 12, the VIX slid from 40.72 to less than 20, the level that many consider the delineator between normal and elevated volatility. The 21-day slide was the fastest the VIX has settled back into normal territory in its history going back to 1990, according to a recent analysis from Bespoke Investment Management. Easing trade tensions has been the primary driver of the VIX\u2019s decline in recent weeks. U.S. and Chinese officials agreed last weekend to slash their respective tariff rates for 90 days while the two countries discuss a more lasting end to their tit-for-tat trade war. When officials announced the agreement on Monday, the VIX fell below 20 and the S&P 500erasedthe last of its \u201cLiberation Day\u201d losses. The VIX closed Friday at 17.24, down more than 20% from a week earlier. Trump\u2019s various tariff pauses \u201cgave a lot of portfolio managers the confidence that the off ramp was there,\u201d said David Kostin, chief U.S. equities strategist at Goldman Sachs Research. But the \"off ramp\" hasn't returned tariffs to their former levels; it's put them on a new path entirely. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sundaywrote offthe possibility of lowering tariffs below 10%. The effective U.S. tariff rateis currently 17.83%, up from 2.42% at the beginning of the year and only slightly below the 22.44% rate set on \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d Asolid first-quarter earnings seasonhas helped to smooth over some lingering concerns about the drag tariffs could have on economic growth. Heading into this week, the S&P 500 was on track to report earnings growth of more than 13%, well above the 7% expected at the end of March. Plenty of uncertainty about the outlook remains. \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs are set to resume in early July, right around the time companies begin reporting earnings for the quarter in which the bulk of tariffs took effect. That period could see a return to April's volatility if the White House can't reach agreements with thedozens of countriesit has threatened with tariffs.",

        "content": "The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) may be hitting its next leg.Microsoftjust reported accelerated cloud computing growth due to AI, while OpenAI's ChatGPT is gaining hundreds of millions of users around the globe. One stock benefiting from this recovery isSuper Micro Computer(SMCI5.00%). The data center assembler is up around 20% in the last month and just got an upgrade from a Wall Street analyst. Should you buy Super Micro Computer stock to for the next leg up in AI? In the last five years, Super Micro Computer's revenue is up over 500%. This is due to the growing spending on data center solutions from AI infrastructure providers like Microsoft. Super Micro Computer is an expert in assembling data centers with advanced computer chips from the likes ofNvidia, where Super Micro Computer spends a lot of money. Companies like Microsoft will go to Super Micro Computer for efficient outsourcing of AI data center assembly as they try to build out more computing resources as fast as possible to keep up with demand. Management is currently guiding for $21.8 billion to $22.6 billion in revenue this fiscal year (ending in June), which is a slight decline from its previous guidance but would still represent solid growth from $15 billion in revenue last fiscal year. As demand seems to be picking up for AI infrastructure again, Super Micro Computer is seeing its stock rocket higher. However, it is still down 67% from all-time highs and currently sports a market cap of $23 billion. Image source: Getty Images. Super Micro Computer is a beneficiary of AI. Super Micro Computer is simply a middleman for computer chips and data centers. Nvidia has a 62% operating margin. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a 37.5% operating margin. Last quarter, Super Micro Computer had agross marginunder 10%. What does this mean? Super Micro Computer is able to sell its products at only a slight premium to its input costs, which gives it extremely slim profit margins compared to its suppliers and customers. Nvidia and the AI cloud infrastructure companies hold a lot of power in the relationship. Last quarter, Super Micro Computer had a slim operating margin of just 3.2%. This could pose trouble in a cyclical downturn, which will eventually come for the AI market. This is the ideal operating environment for Super Micro Computer -- you couldn't ask for more demand from customers -- yet it still is barely generating a profit. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. Things are going well for Super Micro Computer right now. Its stock is up over 1,000% in the last five years, even including its recent drawdown. The stock still looks cheap, with a market cap of $23.2 billion and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19. If demand for AI data center assembly keeps growing, the stock will likely be higher in a few years. I still don't think it is a good buy for a long-term portfolio. A cyclical downturn will eventually arrive in data center spending, which will almost assuredly lead to declining profit margins for Super Micro Computer. Given its already razor-thin profit margins with demand for its products and services at a fever pitch, it is likely to lose money when the cycle inevitably flips. This may not happen for a year or five, but it will happen eventually. Super Micro Computer has thin margins because it does not provide the most value for the AI sector. This comes from Nvidia's innovative computer chips, which it can sell at a premium price, and the cloud infrastructure providers selling computing power to software companies. Super Micro Computer does have a lot of revenue right now, but it is simply a middleman packaging computer chips together. It has practically zero competitive edge. Even though Super Micro Computer is growing fast today and looks to be trading at a cheap price, investors would be smart to avoid buying shares. This is a cyclical company with no long-term competitive advantage in its industry.",

        "content": "Nvidia-backed AI cloud company CoreWeave (CRWV) stock has soared over 100% since its IPO in March as investors' hopes for the AI boom outweigh concerns over what some analysts say is a risky business model. Over the same time frame, the S&P 500 gained a much more modest 7%. CoreWeave is one of the largest holders of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and rents its data center capacity to Big Tech firms such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) as theyscramble to power their AI ambitions. Nvidia (NVDA) holds a 7% stake in CoreWeave, according to the AI chipmaker'sfiling to the SEC Thursday. In addition to backing the company, Nvidia both sells chips to and buys data center capacity from CoreWeave. CoreWeave reported its first quarterly earnings results as a public companythis week, featuring soaring revenue for the three months ending March 31 and a bullish revenue outlook for the year, far ahead of Wall Street's expectations, on a $4 billion deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. However, the stock dropped after the earnings call, dragged down by a higher-than-anticipated outlook for capital expenditures. Wall Street analysts maintained their optimism for CoreWeave stock following its earnings. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who holds a Buy rating on the stock, raised his price target on shares to $80 from $51 Thursday, citing \"insatiable demand.\" Macquarie analyst Paul Golding raised his price outlook to $65 from $56. He said in a note that CoreWeave's outlook \"highlights the ever-accelerating nature of AI demand, along with CoreWeave's agility in responding to this.\" Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, who has an Equal-weight rating on the stock, said in a note that \"accruing large contracts from the most demanding GenAI users provides strong validation of CoreWeave's strong positioning.\" He raised his price target to $58 from $46. Other analysts remain skeptical. DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria downgraded CoreWeave to an Underperform on Thursday, citing its $23 billion capital expenditure forecast for 2025, just as it projects much less (around $5 billion) in revenue. Luria told Yahoo Finance in an interview this week that CoreWeave's capital structure is \"very risky,\" as the company uses debt financing, borrowed against its depreciating store of prior-generation Nvidia Hopper AI chips, to purchase more of the latest Nvidia chips to stay competitive in the AI data center market. CoreWeave has a significant amount of debt \u2014 roughly $12 billion worth of debt commitments with very high interest rates, according to Luria. Its interest expenses are only getting higher, jumping roughly 550% to $264 million in the first quarter from the prior year. A CoreWeave spokesperson told Yahoo Finance: \u201cCoreWeave\u2019s capex and debt structures are strategically aligned with long-term, committed customer contracts \u2013 clear evidence of the powerful demand signals it\u2019s receiving from clients, and provide the company with strong revenue visibility and attractive unit economics.\" CoreWeave is also heavily reliant on only a few customers. In a filing on Thursday, it said that 72% of its revenue came from Microsoft in the first quarter of 2025. Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Felix Wang, who holds a short position on the stock and said he has taken a financial beating because of that bet, said \"the catch here is if the hyperscalers do at some point decide to do their own thing \u2014 whether it's Microsoft building their own own data centers, AWS [Amazon (AMZN) Web Services] building their own data centers \u2014 or the hyperscalers decide to use more ASIC products and not use GPUs per se from Nvidia anymore.\" ASIC products are custom AI chips made by companies such as Broadcom (AVGO), distinct from Nvidia's more general-purpose graphics processing units. Wang said CoreWeave's increasing reliance on OpenAI is also troubling. OpenAI's commitment of an additional $4 billion to CoreWeave in May came on top of its previously announced $11.9 billion deal with the company in March, according to CoreWeave's regulatory filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. OpenAI is losing moneyand relying on continuing to raise capital it doesn\u2019t have to fund both its $16 billion commitment to CoreWeave and$19 billion commitmentto the so-called Stargate AI data center project, which isreportedly struggling to get off the ground. Wang also expressed concerns that OpenAI's biggest backer, SoftBank,has a significant amount of debt. Only in an environment where AI continues to soar at \"exponential\" rates can CoreWeave succeed, Luria said. That's a risk because Big Tech isstill figuring out how to monetize the technologyandcould eventually pull back spending on AI data center capacity. And if Big Tech pulls back on that capacity, companies will likely stop renting extra capacity from CoreWeave on top of operating their own data centers.

However, this question recently came up in the Investing subreddit, where someone askedwhat people would do if they were 25 again. \"What would you do differently?\" The Redditor inquired.

Sharp volatility can cause panic and miss out on great opportunities. Many people regret exiting their positions at the wrong time instead of sticking with their stocks during slower cycles. Even the people who mostly got it right still have some regrets or things that they wish they had done differently.

While investing at a young age can give you a tremendous head start, you have to increase your investments and income to expand your portfolio. One commenter explained the importance of reaching a $100,000 net worth and used a quote from Charlie Munger to demonstrate their point. \"Don\u2019t worry about earning millions; instead, focus on the first $100,000 because, after that, your net worth will go crazy,\" Munger had previously said. Net worth catapults after $100,000 because of the significance of a 10% gain. If you get a 10% gain on $1,000, you end up with $1,100. However, a 10% gain on $100,000 results in $110,000.

        "content": "When it comes to data center stocks, you may be more familiar with the likes ofVertivorCoreWeave. Indeed, both of those companies are heavily plugged into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. However, one of my top stock picks for 2025 is an under-the-radar data center player calledNebius Group(NBIS4.13%). If you're unfamiliar with Nebius, rest easy. With the support ofNvidiaand billionaire investor andAmazonfounder Jeff Bezos, Nebius has a lot going for it. With earnings right around the corner on May 20, now may be the time to pounce on this emerging AI star. Nebius is actually a spinoff from a Russian internet conglomerate called Yandex. Following Yandex's divestiture of the Nebius asset, the company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange and subsequently raised $700 million through a private placement in which Nvidia participated. Nebius is involved with several different businesses. While its primary focus is outfitting data centers with the latest GPU architecture, the company also operates an AI services business calledToloka-- which recently raised funding from Bezos Expeditions. Image source: Getty Images. Back in February, Nebius reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full calendar year 2024. During the fourth quarter, the company generated $37.9 million in revenue -- up 466% year over year. The AI infrastructure represented over half of this revenue -- growing by more than 600% annually. While these figures are encouraging, I think the Nebius rocket ship hasn't even taken off yet. Management told investors thatannual recurring revenue (ARR)reached $90 million in December. If that figure is uninspiring, don't worry. Per the company's guidance, ARR by the end of the first quarter is expected to be \"at least $220 million\" -- more than double December's ARR. Moreover, management is forecasting ARR by year-end to be in the range of $750 million to $1 billion. But how exactly is the company going to reach these targets and scale by this magnitude? Well, consider the fact that Nebius is heavily involved in the rollout ofNvidia's latest GPU architecture, dubbed Blackwell, across Europe and the U.S. Furthermore, cloud hyperscalersMicrosoft,Alphabet, and Amazon, as well asMeta Platforms, are collectively going to spend upward of$300 billion on capital expenditures(capex) just this year. From a macro perspective, rising AI infrastructure is a positive tailwind for Nebius and has me confident in the company's ability to succeed in the long run. While Nebius stock is trading below prior highs, recent trends suggest that shares are currently experiencing some momentum. Over the last few days, the capital markets have been roaring -- thanks in large part to positive reactions surrounding new tariff agreements between the U.S. and China. I think Nebius has gotten caught up in broader buying, making right now a little bit of dicey opportunity. NBISdata byYCharts. To me, the most important thing to be on the lookout for during the Q1 earnings call next week will whether or not Nebius reaches or exceeds its ARR goal of $220 million. And going off of that, it will be equally important to listen to management's forecasts for the remainder of the year. While I am optimistic that Nebius will produce strong results in Q1, I tend to shy away frominvesting in momentum stocks. As a long-term investor, I understand that there will be more chances to buy stocks at more reasonable valuations. For these reasons, I think the most prudent strategy will be to dial into the earnings call next week and digest management's comments while assessing the company's financial profile. While the stock could experience a parabolic rise on the backbone of a positive earnings report, my hunch is that these gains will be fleeting -- ultimately providing investors with more optimal entry points to initiate a position.",

        "content": "I don't know where the stock market is going in 2025. Wall Street has been an unpredictable place lately -- and short-term market trends are coin-flip bets in the best of times. But I do know that a couple of artificial intelligence (AI) investments look ready for a price correction right now. And I wouldn't mind holding them for the long haul. Their business prospects are great in the long run, and the stocks should serve my portfolio nicely even if I pick them up at inflated share prices. Still, I'd much rather wait for the next market retreat from high-flying growth stocks. These top-notch AI experts may look good now, but they'd be even better ideas at a lower price. Will the next bear market start in 2025? I'm not sure, but I want to pounce on these ideas if and when it happens. Semiconductor designerNvidia(NVDA0.28%)has made a lot of investors very happy in recent years. Formerly known as a gaming hardware specialist with a side gig in large-scale number-crunching chips, Nvidia emerged as the leading provider of AI accelerator equipment in 2022. Its accelerators were used to train OpenAI's ChatGPT 3 system, which opened the doors for the AI boom that still feels fresh and game-changing in 2025. The stock market was quick to embrace Nvidia's newfound AI success. Share prices soared more than 800% higher over the first two years of the ChatGPT era. The bullish move was more than empty speculation, too: Nvidia quadrupled its annual revenues over the same period, whilefree cash flowssurged 1,380% higher. So Nvidia's business is booming, and many investors expect its AI dominance to continue for many years. The stock price has dropped back roughly 10% from February's all-time highs, but it's still a big winner from a long-term perspective. Image source: Getty Images. And Nvidia's stock is still priced for perfection. It trades at 25 times trailing sales and 54 times free cash flows. That's a lot, even for a fast-growing tech titan. All of this would be fine if Nvidia stood alone and unchallenged on this lofty hill, but that's not the situation at all. Longtime rivalAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.91%)stands out as a threat to Nvidia's AI dominance. Its Instinct series of AI accelerators is often comparable to Nvidia's latest and greatest AI chips, especially when you include AMD's lower pricing in the calculation. Other potential challengers to Nvidia's most lucrative AI deals include AI-service leaders such asAlphabet(GOOG1.16%)(GOOGL1.32%)andAmazon(AMZN0.18%)Web Services (AWS). Yes, the largest-volume AI chip buyers have developed their own hardware in order to cut costs while satisfying very specific performance targets or feature sets. So I'm afraid that Nvidia's stock may be overvalued right now, despite the company's proven success and incredible long-term prospects. I might consider buying Nvidia stock again if the stock price steps down by another 20% to 30%. Wake me up if a broad de-risking of Wall Street takes Nvidia's price down to approximately $100 per share. Even that would be a stretch -- I'm just setting loose limits for reconsidering my Nvidia view. Until then, I'd rather keep my money on the sidelines. If you agree that Nvidia's stock might be overpriced, you ain't seen nothing yet.SoundHound AI(SOUN1.50%)makes AI's shares look affordable. The AI services pioneer is unprofitable, and the stock trades at 44 times sales. However, the company's high-quality interface between the human voice and automated computer systems could be the next big thing in Next Big Things(tm), if you know what I mean. The company is off to a great start. The recent first-quarter earnings report showed SoundHound AI's revenues surging 151% above the year-ago period. Management expects full-year sales to reach approximately $167 million in 2025, nearly doubling last year's $85.7 million. Early clients included automakerStellantisand digital media veteran Pandora, now a division ofSirius XM Holdings. Over the last three years, SoundHound AI's market expansion accelerated with new names such as digital payments giantBlock, Mexican food specialistChipotle Mexican Grill, and home electronics leader LG. I'm just scratching the surface of SoundHound AI's rich customer list, and the voice-driven services have started to roll out on a global scale -- one SoundHound AI client at a time. It's a diverse list of partners. You can find SoundHound AI's voice-driven services at local drive-thru windows, in customer service phone menus, and interactions with your favorite smart home gadgets. If that sounds like a huge market opportunity, you'll understand why I'm excited about SoundHound AI's long-term future. At the same time, you've seen the ultra-expensive stock. SoundHound AI may be the best name in the voice controls business, but it's far from the only option, and many of its potential rivals are tech titans like Alphabet or Amazon. SoundHound AI's success is not guaranteed, and the stock price should reflect a significant risk-based discount. It's been four months since I saidSoundHound AI would look like a buy at $7 per share. Not much has changed since then. SoundHound AI's stock is down 20% from the middle of January, but the current $11 price remains far above my $7 starting-price target. Like Nvidia, SoundHound AI should be sensitive to marketwide risk adjustments. The next sustained downturn could be just what my price-sensitive stock-picking fingers are looking for. Until then, I'm just holding the shares I already own.",

        "content": "When President Trump announced the imposition of worldwide tariffs last month, the reaction from investors was swift and severe. Each of the major market indexes fell intocorrection territory-- marked by a decline of more than 10%. The sell-off was led by theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC0.52%), which briefly entered abear market, marked by a decline of 20% from its recent high. Seasoned investors know that market downturns don't discriminate, punishing good stocks and bad, presenting the opportunity to buy top-shelf stocks at discounted prices. I viewed the downturn as an opportunity and pounced, deploying about half my available cash to \"stock\" up on some of my highest-conviction stocks. Here are five that I bought. Image source: Getty Images. With the onset of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in early 2023,Nvidia(NVDA0.28%)cemented its place as one of the most important technology companies in a generation. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) were already the industry standard for AI and quickly became the go-to to upgrade data centers to meet the rigorous demands ofgenerative AI. Fears regarding slowing AI acceleration, export restrictions to China, and the impact of tariffs hit the chipmaker hard, sending its stock down roughly 37%. Yet I viewed the selling as overdone. The full adoption of AI is expected to take place over years, if not decades, and Nvidia is well-positioned to profit from this secular tailwind. In its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 26), revenue of $39 billion grew 78% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) surged 82%. These results suggest that AI still has room to run. Finally, at just 31 times forward earnings, Nvidia is attractively priced, particularly given its impressive growth rate. If Nvidia is the king of AI,Broadcom(AVGO-1.76%)could well be the queen. The company offers a vast array of semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions that power technology across the cable, mobile, broadband, and data center industries. This puts the company in pole position to benefit from the ongoing wave of digital transformation. Broadcom estimates that \"99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology.\" However, it's thedata centeropportunity that stands out, as that's where the majority of AI processing occurs. This makes Broadcom a critical provider of AI infrastructure. The results speak for themselves. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Feb. 2), Broadcom generated revenue that jumped 25% to $15 billion, while adjusted EPS climbed 45% to $1.60. While Broadcom is currently selling for 35 times forward earnings, the company's consistent track record of growth and the vast opportunity ahead make the stock a buy. As the world's largest online retailer, the tariffs announcement took a bite out ofAmazon(AMZN0.18%), driving its stock down nearly 31%. Yet, history has shown the company has been remarkably adept at adapting its business to changing macroeconomic and geopolitical situations while positioning itself for future success. The recent pivot of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to become a hub of AI, and the reacceleration of its cloud growth, is a testament to its agile nature. Image source: Getty Images. It's also worth pointing out that while digital retail accounted for 81% of Amazon's revenue, AWS is responsible for 63% of its profits, and the segment likely won't feel the pinch of tariffs. Furthermore, the breadth of Amazon's merchant base will give shoppers plenty of options to choose from -- even if the temporary suspension of reciprocal tariffs expires. Finally, improving economic conditions could be a boon to Amazon. And 3 times next year's sales is a fair price for a company with so many ways to win. The threat of tariffs took a toll on many stocks, butShopify(SHOP0.41%)was hit harder than most. From the announcement of North American tariffs in mid-February to early April, the e-commerce platform's stock price plummeted by more than 40%. Many of Shopify's merchants fell under the so-called \"de minimus exemption,\" which allowed goods worth $800 or less to be imported duty-free. That exemption was suspended early last month, a move investors feared would wreak havoc on many of Shopify's smaller merchants. Earlier this month, Shopify unveiled tariffguide.ai to counter that threat. This AI-powered tool provides tariff rates based on a product description and country of origin, enabling merchants to make data-driven decisions to adjust their product pipelines in minutes rather than days. Despite the imposition of tariffs, small and large businesses alike continued to join Shopify's ranks. In the first quarter, revenue of $2.36 billion jumped 27% year over year, while its operating income jumped 136%. Shopify's agility has served the company well, enabling it to adjust on the fly in even the most complex of macroeconomic environments. The stock is currently selling for 15 times sales, and while that might seem expensive, that's well below its 10-year average multiple of 22. Heading into its fourth quarter,The Trade Desk(TTD-1.52%)had an unblemished track record of meeting or exceeding its own guidance, and investors rewarded the company with a high valuation. That came to a screeching halt earlier this year when The Trade Desk not only missed Wall Street's expectations but its own forecast, and the stock cratered. The decline was exacerbated by the tariff-induced market swoon that followed. In fact, between early December and early April, The Trade Desk stock shed 67% of its value. One mark of a good management team is owning up to its mistakes and taking steps to correct them -- and that's precisely what The Trade Desk did. During the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jeff Green said, \"I want to acknowledge up front that for the first time in 33 quarters as a public company, we fell short of our own expectations.\" He went on to cite a \"series of small execution missteps\" and outlined management's plan to address those shortfalls. Given the company'snearlyflawless track record, this seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up, so I added to my position. It turns out my faith in The Trade Desk's management team was justified. In the first quarter, growth reaccelerated, as revenue of $616 million climbed 25%, and adjusted EPS jumped 27%. The Trade Desk is also reasonably priced, with aprice/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratioof 0.92, when any number less than 1 suggests an undervalued stock.",

        "header": "Could Rigetti Computing Be the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "If you invested inNvidiastock on Nov. 30, 2022 and held your position until today, then you would be up on your investment by nearly eightfold. Why that date? Because this is the day OpenAI commercially released ChatGPT and spawned the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. For the last few years, just about anything touching or referencing AI garnered attention from growth investors. But now that we're a few years into the AI saga, people are beginning to look for more specific opportunities underneath the broader AI umbrella. For the last several months,quantum computinghas burst onto the scene as one of AI's \"next big things.\" And among popular quantum computing stocks isRigetti Computing(RGTI2.56%)-- which has seen its shares rise by 521% in just the last six months (at the time of this writing). As the prospects of quantum computing gain more momentum in the investment world, could Rigetti be on its way to becoming the next Nvidia? If you're unfamiliar with quantum computing, it's likely because the technology isn't widely scaled today. Companies such asIonQ,D-Wave Quantum, and of course, Rigetti Computing have emerged at the forefront of the quantum computing movement over the last several months. Considering thetotal addressable market for quantum computingis expected to reach $131 billion over the next 15 years, it's understandable why investors would be flocking to these new players disrupting the AI landscape. While a large market could suggest long-term growth prospects, smart investors understand that these dynamics don't necessarily make it a sound investment opportunity right now. Image source: Getty Images. The chart illustrates Rigetti Computing's revenue and net loss over the last year. As I alluded to, quantum computing doesn't have many use cases for today's AI applications. This is underscored by Rigetti's paltry $10.8 million in annual sales. While the market size is expected to grow by billions over the coming years, the more subtle theme is that developing quantum computing technology is going to require hefty investments -- another trend that's indicated by Rigetti's soaring losses.  RGTI Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts Generating $10 million in sales while burning $200 million in capital a yearisn't exactly a recipe for growth. This financial profile makes it hard to justify Rigetti's $3 billion market cap. It's easy to compare the potential around quantum computing to the bullish narratives that surround AI. The thing is that back in 2022, Nvidia's core AI products and services -- namely its GPUs -- were already being used for a host of other applications. I bring this up to make that point that Nvidia already had an established product-market fit for its chipsets -- management simply realized that GPUs would serve as an integral piece of hardware for developing generative AI; hence the value proposition was already there. I don't think this necessarily holds true for what Rigetti is trying to achieve in quantum computing. Another way of saying this is that the company's investments in AI infrastructure might never fully pay off. For this reason, I seeRigetti as an extremely speculative stock to own. To me, the parabolic rise in Rigetti's stock price is rooted more in momentum trading -- a feature often exhibited bymeme stocks. As the quantum computing chapter continues to be written, I suspect savvy investors will come to realize that AI's biggest players such as Nvidia,Microsoft,Alphabet, andAmazonalready have firm footing in this space -- making it even harder for Rigetti to truly compete in the long run. Unlike an investment in Nvidia, I seeRigetti's valuation normalizing significantly over the next few years. Hence, I think the stock price could experience a significant drawdown. Ultimately, I would pass on investing in Rigetti, as I do not see the company as a true pioneer in quantum computing -- certainly not in the same transformative way that Nvidia supercharged the AI movement.",

        "content": "Analysts atBank of Americaare bullishon chip stocks likeNvidiaas mega-projects in the Middle East highlight long-term demand for AI computing. Also bolstering the case for the stocks is the emergence of AI chips as the new \"coin of the realm,\" serving as currency in geopolitical talks. AI chips, such as the graphics processing units that are critical to Nvidia's success, have become so important globally they are like a form of currency in geopolitical talks on trade, according to analysts at Bank of America. That's as recent mega-deals point to continued demand for AI computing power. In a note on Tuesday, BofA estimated that Nvidia's and AMD'sAI infrastructure projects with Humain, a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, would come out to $3 billion-$5 billion annually, or $15 billion-$20 billion over a multi-year period. Humain will receive18,000 cutting-edge Blackwell chipsfrom Nvidia, while AMD, a close rival of Nvidia in AI accelerators, signed a$10 billion collaborationwith Humain to provide 500 megawatts of AI compute capacity for its data centers. Such \"sovereign AI\" deals could represent more than $50 billion annually in the overall $450 billion-$500 billion global AI infrastructure market opportunity globally, BofA said. \"Sovereign AI could also help address limited power availability for data centers in US, plus offset headwinds from restrictions on US companies shipping to China,\" analysts added. Nvidia and AMD are poised to be the biggest winners from the Saudi project, according to BofA, which reiterated buy ratings on those stocks and hiked their prices targets to $160 from $150 and to $130 from $120, respectively. Chip stocksBroadcomandMarvell Technologywill also benefit as will optical connectivity providerCoherent, the note said, reiterating buy ratings on those too. \"Despite being more crowded we believe these vendors are exposed to the modest dependable/secular demand for AI deployments by well-funded: 1) hyperscale/cloud customers (CY25 capex now tracking +44% YoY vs. +7% YoY at same point last year), 2) Recent dissolution of restrictive AI diffusion rules, and 3) Important role played by AI chips as part of geopolitical negotiations around trade/tariffs (GPU as the new 'coin of the realm'),\" BofA said. Indeed, Nvidia is seen as abargaining chip in U.S.-China trade talksas both sides seek to lower barriers while also maintaining their own technological advantages. Meanwhile, Humain\u2019s deal with Nvidia not only represents the next steps in Trump\u2019s efforts to court Mideast countries, but also elevates Nvidia\u2019s role in global AI development. The thousands of semiconductor chips Humain will receive are Nvidia\u2019snewest and most powerful, introduced only in March. While U.S. AI hyperscalers like Alphabet andAmazonwill remain a priority for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia will get preferential treatment over other countries, Wedbush managing director Dan Ives toldFortune'sSasha Rogelberg this past week. \u201cThis puts them to the front of the line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a red-carpet rollout. It\u2019s a region that ultimately could add a trillion dollars to the market opportunity for AI over the next decade.\u201d \u201cWith China still a tenuous situation, I think it\u2019s a watershed moment,\u201d he added.
