        "content": "By Wen-Yee Lee TAIPEI (Reuters) - At Taiwan's annual Computex trade show next week, the spotlight is expected to fall, once again, on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and the latest in artificial intelligence, but also on the potential destablising impact of higher U.S. tariffs. Huang, who last year sparked \"Jensanity\" from avid fans at the fair, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Foxconn Chairman Young Liu will be among top executives attending. Computex, which runs May 20-23 and is expected to have 1,400 exhibitors, marks the first major gathering of computer and chip bosses in Asia since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sweeping reciprocal tariffs in April, pushing companies to produce more in the United States. \"If last year's headline was AI PCs, this year it's probably going to be about collaboration, driven by the macroeconomics,\" said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at consulting firm More Than Moore. Huang, who is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech on Monday, is expected to announce more Nvidia partnerships with AI server firms in Taiwan, such as Foxconn and Quanta. \"Obviously, Nvidia relies a lot on the Taiwanese ecosystem to deliver,\" Cutress said. \"There may be some sort of nod to the political tariff situation.\" Nvidia said in April it would produce AI servers worth $500 billion in the U.S. over four years, working with companies like TSMC, Foxconn and Wistron. Nvidia and AMD also have to contend with tighter export controls on sales of advanced AI graphics processing units to China. Qualcomm said it will provide updates on its AI PC developments while MediaTek plans to outline its vision for edge AI, which involves running AI software on devices near the data source, as well as cloud AI. AMD will discuss its advancements in gaming and AI-powered personal computers. Intel's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan does not plan to speak publicly at Computex this year but will host a private dinner with Taiwanese partners. Taiwan's Advantech, the world's largest maker of industrial computers, will return after a decade-long absence with plans to showcase its AI systems. Its chairman, K.C. Liu, said this month that Huang had done much to help the show evolve from being focused on consumer goods such as laptops to one that highlights technological advances and brings much-needed publicity to products for businesses. \"Taiwan has also changed,\" Liu said. \"The entire industry has shifted toward AI, so it's no longer enough to focus solely on B2C products.\" (Reporting by Wen-Yee Lee; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Brenda Goh and Edwina Gibbs)",

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares surged to their highest level since late February on Wednesday, boosted by arecent AI deal and bullish analyst commentary. The server maker announced a $20 billion partnership with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt late Tuesday, coinciding with Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also announcing deals with firms in the kingdom as President Donald Trump began a four-day trip to the Middle East.

        "header": "A Nasdaq Bull Market Is Coming. 3 Things You Should Do Before It Arrives.",
        "content": "Stocks have been on fire over the past few days -- and for good reason. A move by the U.S. and China has helped companies and the overall economy avert a huge problem. The countries, which were involved in a trade war, struck an initial deal on import tariffs -- one that was better than what most analysts expected. As a result, the major benchmarks surged, with theS&P 500(^GSPC0.10%)moving into positive territory for the year as of the May 13 market close, and theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC0.72%)climbing 24% since its April low. For an index to enter a new bull market, it must advance more than 20% from its recent low and reach a new record high -- so a Nasdaq bull market may be on the way. Let's check out three things every investor should do before it arrives. Image source: Getty Images. With indexes and individual stocks surging, it might be tempting to sell shares and lock in a quick profit. For example, high-growth stocksNvidia(NVDA4.12%)andTeslaeach soared in the double-digits over the past few days following the agreement reached by the U.S. and China -- meaning a sell now could equal profit for some investors. These players were among the big decliners in recent months amid concern that a high-tariff environment would weigh on their earnings prospects. And, of course, many other stocks experienced the same pattern -- deep declines last month and a sharp recovery over the past few days. If you hold shares of these companies, you might consider selling and locking in a profit -- but before you do, it's important to consider each company's long-term potential. I'll use Nvidia as an example. Yes, the shares have climbed in the triple digits over the past three years, but the company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, is likely to maintain this position thanks to its strong focus on innovation, and the AI growth story is in its early stages. So Nvidia could continue to deliver gains for quite some time. This doesn't mean you shouldn't reduce any positions. It just means that, before you do, consider each company's prospects over the years to come. A double-digit gain today is great -- but certain players could deliver much more over the long run. Stocks are soaring, which means valuations also are heading higher. We can see this in theS&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio, a measure of stock prices and earnings over a 10-year period -- to allow for shifts in the economy. This indicator reached highs earlier in the year, then started to decline, and now, as you can see in the chart, it's on the rise again.  S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratiodata byYCharts It's important to note that the market as a whole, even after recent declines, hasn't reached \"cheap\" territory. The S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio of 34 is a high level, only surpassed twice over the past decade.  S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratiodata byYCharts But, even in this context and as stocks rise, you still can find bargains -- especially among stocks that suffered the most earlier in the year. Many tech stocks are very reasonably priced today, and a good example isAlphabet(GOOG3.67%)(GOOGL3.64%), which at aforward price-to-earnings ratioof 16 is thecheapest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. So, as stocks rise, continue looking for bargains -- you can find them during any market environment. Finally, considering this idea that bargains may be found in both bear and bull markets, now is the perfect time to evaluate your cash position. Stocks are on the rise, and as a whole may be getting more expensive, but as mentioned, this doesn't meanevery stockis pricey and opportunities are disappearing. That's why it's important to maintain some cash to deploy when the time is right. So, if all of your bills are paid and you can set aside cash -- whether it's a few dollars or a large sum -- do that. When the Nasdaqbull marketarrives, you'll be prepared for any opportunity that arises -- and can seize it at the right moment.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA4.12%)first reached a market cap of $3 trillion in June 2024. The giantGPUmaker remained above the threshold throughout much of the next eight months before a steep sell-off this year. However, Nvidia just rejoinedApple(AAPL-0.28%)andMicrosoft(MSFT0.81%)in the $3 trillion club. Could it even become the first $4 trillion stock by 2026? What did Nvidia do to bounce back? Nothing on its own. To understand the stock's rebound, we need to first understand why it fell in the first place. One main culprit for Nvidia was the Trump administration's strict trade restrictions on exports of H20 GPUs to China. Nvidia announced it would take a $5.5 billion writedown in the first quarter of 2025 as a result. The White House'stariffshave also had a major impact on Nvidia's share price (as they have on many other stocks, too). In particular, the especially steep tariffs on imports from China and the retaliatory tariffs the country levied on U.S. imports concerned investors. With those factors causing Nvidia stock to fall, it makes sense that more encouraging news on the trade front helped spark a comeback. Initial signals in recent weeks by the Trump administration that Chinese tariffs would be lower helped. The recent 90-day pause on some of the tariffs provided more reason for optimism. While Nvidia is again in the $3 trillion club and even inched past Apple's market cap, Microsoft is closest to the $4 trillion mark. But could Nvidia jump past Microsoft and remain ahead of Apple? It's quite possible. Microsoft's shares trade at nearly 30 times forward earnings. Apple's forward earnings multiple is roughly 27. Nvidia is a hair behind with shares trading at 26.9 times forward earnings. All else being equal, this lower valuation arguably gives Nvidia more room to run than Microsoft and about the same amount as Apple. Image source: Getty Images. However, the growth prospects for these tech giants aren't equal. Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to soar around 47% this fiscal year and 29% in the next fiscal year. By comparison, analysts look for Apple's earnings to increase 18% this year and 9% next year, with Microsoft delivering earnings growth of almost 14% this year and nearly 13% next year. I think Nvidia is in a stronger position to become the first $4 trillion stock than either Apple or Microsoft. Others, such asAmazonand Google parentAlphabet, are also contenders, but I view them as dark horses in the race. But could Nvidia achieve a $4 trillion market cap by 2026? I'm less confident about the timing. While investors are understandably excited about the lower threat of a full-blown trade war between the U.S. and China, it seems likely that significant tariffs will still be imposed. These tariffs could still put a damper on Nvidia's business to some extent. A possible economic slowdown due to the tariffs could also cause some companies to curtail their investments in artificial intelligence (AI), which could negatively impact data center growth. If so, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs could slip. Nvidia's market cap would need to jump by roughly 25% to hit $4 trillion. I think this level of increasecouldbe attained over the next 18 months or so. However, many variables are at play that could make the goal harder to achieve in such a relatively short time. I predict that Nvidia will be the first $4 trillion stock, but I'll leave the date by which it reaches the mark open.",

        "header": "Is AMD Stock Due for a Big Rally After Its Earnings Beat?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices(AMD4.64%), also known as AMD, reported earnings on May 6, and they were impressive. The chipmaker has been showing signs of progress and a faster growth rate. That could be indicative of the competition that its chips may offer to rivalNvidia, potentially giving the tech giant something to worry about. AMD's stock has been struggling over the past couple of years, while Nvidia has been soaring. But with stronger results and some encouraging growth prospects, is it now time for AMD's stock to shine? Could the company's recent earnings numbers be a catalyst to drive its valuation far higher this year? Image source: Getty Images. AMD's first-quarter report delivered somethinggrowth investorshave been craving for a while now -- strong growth numbers. Revenue rose by 36% year over year to $7.4 billion. That was the company's fastest rate of growth in more than two years, and the top line came in better than the $7.1 billion that Wall Street was expecting.  AMD Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)data byYCharts. The big catalyst for the business was its data center segment, which experienced a 57% growth rate during the period. This was due in part to strong demand for its Instinct chip; the company launched its newest version, the Instinct MI325X, in the fall of last year and said at the time that it would be shipping it in large quantities in the early part of 2025. The Q1 results could be the first sign that the chips are winning over customers and may be able to take some market share from Nvidia. Shares of AMD rallied in the days following the earnings release. However, it may not necessarily be smooth sailing for the chipmaker due to a couple of issues. The first pertains to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. Due to U.S. export restrictions on China, AMD expects to miss out on $1.5 billion in potential revenue this year. Recently, however, there have been reports that the two nations are making progress on a potential trade deal and have paused most of the heavy tariffs they have levied on each other for 90 days. The uncertainty makes it difficult to predict how AMD will do this year. It's an evolving situation that investors should closely monitor. Another issue is that AMD's valuation remains high at 75 times its trailing earnings. The good news is that the ratio drops to 25 when looking at its future earnings (based on analysts' consensus expectations). But when you consider that Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings multiple is just under 27, that may not be enough of a discount to convince investors to go with AMD instead of its bigger rival. AMD's stock is down by close to 30% from where it traded a year ago, but it has been rising recently and could head higher, especially if the company can build on its Q1 results and accelerate its growth rate. But that's not a guarantee by any means, given the uncertainty around tariffs and the ongoing trade war with China. AMD could be a goodartificial intelligence (AI) stockto own, but it's a riskier option than Nvidia, which has stronger margins and a dominant position in the AI chip market. Depending on your risk tolerance, you may want to go with AMD, Nvidia, or perhaps even hold both in your portfolio.",

        "content": "If one word can sum up the story of the stock market in 2025, it is tariffs. President Donald Trump has levied baseline tariffs on goods from many nations around the globe, but his administration has taken its most aggressive stance against China. For weeks, Chinese imports were being taxed at an average rate of more than 100% (and in many cases, up to 145%), upending supply chains and making some goods all but unsellable in the U.S. Amazon(AMZN-0.61%)faces headwinds because of these tariffs, as a lot of the sellers on its e-commerce marketplace source their goods from China and other nations that Trump is targeting aggressively. The tech giant's stock is down 14% from its all-time high as of this writing, giving it a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Despite these headwinds, I believe Amazon is poised to become the first company with a $5 trillion market cap, outpacing companies likeMicrosoftandNvidiaen route to that milestone. Here's why. In order for Amazon to reach a market cap of $5 trillion, it will need to keep growing its revenues at a double-digit rate (it grew its top line 10% year over year last quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange). And it can do so because of the long-term growth potential in both e-commerce and cloud computing, two sectors where it remains a leader. E-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales in the U.S. is still well below 20%, even after the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily accelerated the shift toward online shopping. That share is once again climbing higher year after year, and given Amazon's dominance in North American e-commerce, the company should benefit. It also has an international segment with online sales platforms in countries like India and Japan. That part of the business is now closing in on $150 billion in annual revenues, and it has room to head higher over the next 10 years. However, its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has perhaps an even better long-term growth trajectory. The corporate world's transition away from on-premises servers to cloud-computing data centers is a long-term trend that is still in its early innings. It's also getting supercharged by the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). The cloud computing market will grow 15% to 20% annually through 2030, according to various estimates, and that's in line with AWS' revenue growth of 17% last quarter. AWS had more than $100 billion in sales over the last four reported quarters, and it has the potential to exceed $200 billion in annual revenues within the next decade due to these major tailwinds. Image source: Amazon. Another factor working in Amazon's favor is profit margin expansion. Its most profitable segments are the ones growing the fastest, which should boost its margins in the next few years. For example, AWS boasted an operating margin of just under 40% last quarter, while its North America segment, which includes the core marketplace, had a margin of just 6%. However, individual pieces of the North America segment are likely faring better. Advertising revenue grew 19%, and it probably has high profit margins too. Subscription revenue also grew 11% year over year. Together, those two business contributed almost $26 billion in sales last quarter. Add it all up, and Amazon could expand its net profit margin from its current 10% and eventually reach 15% (or even 20%) over the next decade if it stays disciplined around expenses. Heavy spending became a problem in 2021 and 2022, but today, management has lifted the company's net margin to an all-time high with room to grow. Combine that with steady revenue growth, and Amazon's earnings could soar.  Data byYCharts. Amazon is also developing new units like Project Kuiper -- its plan to bring satellite internet to millions around the globe. It will cost around $10 billion to build and deploy the satellite constellation that will support its service, and zero revenue is coming in from Kuiper today. But the payoff in the near future could further boost revenue and expand profitability. AI could provide a big tailwind for its e-commerce marketplace as well, although it is hard to quantify the cost of development on that front. In 2024, Amazon generated $638 billion in annual revenue. If it grows its top line by 10% annually through 2030, it will reach just over $1 trillion in revenue. Apply a 15% net margin, and you have approximately $150 billion in earnings for Amazon in 2030. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 35 as of this writing. Combining that valuation multiple with $150 billion of projected earnings is enough to bring Amazon above the $5 trillion milestone. The company won't grow its top and bottom lines on a straight path exactly as outlined in the above scenario. The key takeaway here is the potential for multiple tailwinds to drive its long-term growth. A leadership position across multiple industries is why Amazon will be the first stock to reach a market cap of $5 trillion.",

        "content": "It's been a hectic year for investors. Less than a month ago, theS&P 500was down as much as 15% on the year while the tech-heavyNasdaq Compositefared even worse -- dropping by as much as 21%. Over the last several weeks, however, the capital markets have shown some signs of resiliency and gradually started to rebound. As of this writing, the S&P 500 is now near breakeven on the year while the Nasdaq is down by just 3%. One of the contributing factors to these recent jolts has been quarterly earnings. Throughout April, companies have reported financial results for the first quarter of 2025. And for the most part, investors appear to be pleased with where things stand. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) companies not only reported strong financials in Q1, but their outlooks remained quite robust. Cloud hyperscalersAmazon,Microsoft, andAlphabetmaintained their capital expenditure (capex) guidance for the year, whileMeta Platformsactually raised its AI infrastructure outlook. Indeed, these are positive tailwinds for GPU players such asNvidiaandAdvanced Micro Devices. While Nvidia is scheduled toreport earnings on May 28, I actually have my eyes on another semiconductor stock that could be the better buy this month. Let's explore whyBroadcom(AVGO-0.18%)looks like a great under-the-radar opportunity right now. Among cloud hyperscalers and Meta, AI infrastructure spend is forecast to be above $300 billion just this year. While much of that spend will be allocated toward GPUs developed by Nvidia and AMD, each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" players I referenced above are also building their own in-house chips.Custom siliconis a unique solution that Broadcom offers, hence rising AI capex from these players is also a positive sign for the company. In fact, during the earnings call back in March, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that the company beat its AI revenue target \"due to stronger shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers.\" As Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet continue to outfitdata centerswith AI GPUs and networking equipment, it's highly likely that Broadcom is going to touch this infrastructure in some capacity. Image source: Getty Images. The chart below illustrates Broadcom's share price movement since the company reported its last earnings on March 6. While you might think these returns are due to a positively received earnings report, I think something else is at play here.  AVGOdata byYCharts You'll notice that the entirety of the gains illustrated above occurred after March. What may have been the catalyst here? Well, on April 7 Broadcom announced a $10 billionshare buybackauthorization. Therepurchase program runs through Dec. 31. This does not mean that Broadcom has to buy all (or any) stock back; but if it chooses to do so, it only has until the end of the year. Given that Broadcom made this announcement alongside a wave of encouraging earnings reports and renewed AI infrastructure investments, I think it's likely that management sees a rebound in store for the stock during the latter half of the year on the back of continued strength in the AI business and demand from hyperscalers. Hence, the timing of the buyback seems strategic in my eyes. Broadcom is scheduled to report earnings on June 5. At that point in time, each of the Magnificent Seven companies and AMD will have reported. The common thread among them is that growth is humming along just fine across their respective AI businesses. I'm optimistic the same will be in store for Broadcom. Should Nvidia's earnings report later this month follow in the footsteps of its peers, I think it's likely that Broadcom shares could get dragged into a macro uptick. Moreover, during the earnings report investors should also get an idea whether or not part of the stock's recent surge could be attributed to the buyback. For these reasons, I think now is a greattime to buy Broadcom stock-- before the company reports earnings in early June.",

Sebastien Naji; Analyst; William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Operator Welcome to Cisco's third quarter fiscal year 2025 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Ahmed Sami Badri Good afternoon, everyone. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; Scott Herren, our CFO; and Mark Patterson, our Chief Strategy Officer. Cisco's earnings press release and supplemental information, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our Investor Relations website. Following this call, we will also make the recorded webcast and slides available on the website. Throughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.We will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis. Please note that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025.These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings particularly our most recent 10-K and 10-Q reports, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Now I'll turn it over to Chuck. Charles Robbins Thanks, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter for Cisco, with revenue, margins, and earnings per share all above the high end of our guidance ranges. We also generated solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue, which all support our future performance.In addition, we received AI infrastructure orders from web-scale customers in excess of $600 million in Q3 and bringing our year-to-date total to well over $1 billion, surpassing our original fiscal year 25 AI order target a full quarter early. The performance of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, underpinning our commitment to deliver consistent capital returns.In Q3, we returned $3.1 billion in capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with a total of $9.6 billion in value returned year-to-date. Our overall strong performance was a result of accelerated product innovation and solid execution by our teams driving sustained demand for our technologies.Total product orders grew 20% year-over-year or 9% on an organic basis, excluding Splunk. Despite the uncertain macro environment, this demonstrates the valuable outcomes we are delivering for customers in the era of AI. Looking at demand in more detail by customer market.I'd also like to remind you that Q3 of fiscal year 24 included six weeks of spot contribution. Enterprise product orders were up 22% year-over-year in Q3, driven by double-digit growth in the Americas and APJC. Public sector orders were up 8% with growth in all geographies as governments around the world continue to trust Cisco as their end-to-end technology partner. Notably, US federal orders grew double digits in Q3, after a challenging first half.During the quarter, our AI-powered cloud managed Meraki for government networking solution also achieved FedRAMP authorization from the US government. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers continue to be strong, up 32% year-over-year, driven by triple-digit growth in web scale with three of the top six web scalers each growing orders in the triple digits.Now some color on demand from a product perspective. Networking product orders grew double digits driven by web-scale infrastructure, enterprise routing, switching and our industrial IoT products.Campus switching orders grew high single digits in Q3 against a tougher prior year compare, demonstrating the continued demand for our campus portfolio to enterprise customers. We also saw triple-digit sequential growth in orders for our Wi-Fi 7 portfolio in Q3.Year-to-date orders for our industrial Internet of Things portfolio comprised of ruggedized catalyst products grew 35% year-over-year. As strategic infrastructure and manufacturing begins to onshore to the United States, Cisco is well positioned to help connect and protect these capital-intensive investments at scale. Our data center switching orders were up double digits year-to-date compared with the same period last year.Cisco was recently ranked as a market leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for data center switching. This is a testament to our ability to address the full range of data center switching use cases and our vision to simplify operations while enhancing security, which is essential for critical application deployments.As I mentioned earlier, the AI infrastructure orders we have received from web-scale customers were exceptionally strong in the quarter, exceeding $600 million in bringing our year-to-date total to well over our $1 billion target for fiscal year 25. As expected, the product mix of these orders was more than two thirds in systems with the remainder in optics, demonstrating the growing importance of our technology to web-scale customers for their AI training use cases. AI orders from enterprise customers continue to show momentum as this large nascent market opportunity starts to unlock.Enterprises are seeking simple, seamless, scalable, and secure solutions for their AI deployments which we are ready to deliver through our expanding partnership with NVIDIA. During the quarter, we announced our intent to create a cross-portfolio unified architecture, where NVIDIA will enable Cisco Silicon One to become the only third-party silicon that is included as part of the NVIDIA Spectrum ex Ethernet networking reference architecture.Cisco will also build interoperable systems combining NVIDIA Spectrum silicon with Cisco operating system software allowing customers to simultaneous standardize Cisco networking and NVIDIA technology in the data center, across front and back-end networks.We also announced a Cisco secure AI factory with NVIDIA, which will embed security end-to-end. From the application to the workload to the infrastructure, using solutions like Cisco AI Defense and hybrid mesh firewall, enabling enterprise customers to build and secure data centers to develop and run AI workloads.Yesterday, we announced a new multiphase investment program in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia announced a new AI company, HUMAIN, and we will be a strategic technology partner contributing to their AI infrastructure build-outs.This partnership aligns with Saudi Vision 2030, contributing to the Kingdom's transformation into a diversified digital economy and enhancing its global and regional competitiveness in the AI era. In addition, we have joined the AI infrastructure partnership alongside BlackRock Global Infrastructure Partners, MGX, Microsoft, NVIDIA, XAI and Energy Partners GE Renova and exterior energy as it seeks to invest in secure, efficient, and scalable infrastructure to support AI workloads. We also announced an expanded collaboration with G42, the UA based Global Technology Group to advance how secure AI infrastructure and innovation can be scaled across public and private sectors.These investments and partnerships highlight our market position as a global leader and preferred partner in AI networking solutions as well as our commitment to collaborating across the industry to create a strong global ecosystem for AI.Additionally, we expect the sovereign AI cloud opportunity to ramp in the near term and that Cisco will be a core system provider for these significant AI training and inference cluster build-outs. As we look at the opportunity that AI presents for Cisco, it is worth reiterating that we frame it in three distinct but connected pillars.First, AI training infrastructure for web-scale customers. combinations of our Cisco 8-K, Silicon 1 optics and optical systems are being deployed by five of the six largest web scalers.Second, AI inference and enterprise clouds. Our generated innovation in hardware and software, coupled with our NVIDIA partnership is designed to simplify and derisk AI infrastructure deployment for the enterprise.And third, AI network connectivity. Customers are leveraging our technology platforms to help modernize, secure, and automate their network operations to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI agents and applications. With a genetic AI, the network is fundamentally constrained and will require ultrafast, low-latency, energy-efficient networks, which we can deliver.Shifting to security. Orders grew in high double digits in Q3. Our security orders included a large multiyear deal with a major financial services company for Splunk's security and observability platforms, which was driven by our combined sales force. This was a win for Splunk from an industry competitor and is a strong proof point of our go-to-market synergy. This was also the largest deal ever for Splunk.Our recently launched security products of Secure Access, XDR and Hypershield collectively added over 370 new customers in the quarter. The majority of our new Hypershield enterprise customers are bundling it with our new in 9300 Smart Switch because of our unique ability to embed security directly into the fabric of the network. Now I'd like to comment on some highlights from our accelerating innovation pipeline.Safety and security will be the defining challenge of Agentic-AI, and we recently introduced several innovations designed to help security professionals harness the power of AI while keeping security at the forefront. These include Cisco XDR correlating attack telemetry across network, endpoint, and cloud, using new AI-powered solutions to empower security teams to understand complex threats and seconds.Agentic AI advancements for Cisco XDR and Splunk to simplify threat detection and response. A new partnership with ServiceNow, which will integrate their security operations capabilities with Cisco AI Defense and the launch of Foundation AI, a team of leading AI and security experts focused on developing cutting-edge technology to address the fundamental security issues of the AI era with novel open source tools, including the first reasoning model to enhance security applications.Just last week, we introduced Cisco's Quantum network in Santa Monica, a revolutionary prototype making real-world quantum networking applications possible in order to speed up the future of quantum computing. These applications will solve complex customer challenges and drive innovation across industries from supply chain optimization to accelerating drug discovery.In addition, we are using Gen AI and genetic systems across our customer experience organization to maximize customer value, deliver great experiences, boost productivity, and create capacity. Today, over 60% of support cases are touched by AI-driven automation, which is driving up the proportion of complex cases we can solve within one day.In addition, low severity cases have reduced as more customers are using our AI support assistant. Also, our AI renewals agent has enabled us to increase the capacity of our renewal specialists. As you can see, we are driving an enormous amount of innovation, and I look forward to showcasing even more new customer-centric solutions at Cisco Live next month. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd also like to share some important organizational announcements.After careful consideration, Scott has made the decision to retire at the end of fiscal year 2025. As many of you know, Scott joined us in 2020 during a period of great uncertainty around the world and he has been instrumental in driving our transition towards more software and recurring revenue. This has driven greater predictability for our business and increase shareholder value. And I want to thank Scott for all that he has done for Cisco. I am grateful for his partnership as we've managed through many unprecedented situations together.I'm happy to share the beginning day one fiscal year 2026, Mark Patterson, our current Chief Strategy Officer, will serve as Sysco's new Chief Financial Officer. In Mark's nearly 25 years at Cisco, he's held leadership roles in finance, strategy, and operations. He also spent over a decade in sales, working in roles that span every customer segment and geography.Most recently, leading our corporate strategy, development and incubation organization Mark's focus has been on connecting our longer-term strategy and investments with our immediate and urgent growth opportunities. The breadth of his experience, along with his deep knowledge of Cisco and our customers, partners and investor community uniquely position him to help accelerate Cisco's growth in this new role.I'm also excited to announce the promotion of Jeetu Patel to President and Chief Product Officer. Under G2's leadership over the past nine months, he has unified our product vision and strategy and vastly accelerated our innovation pipeline, focusing on delivering even greater value for our customers and our partners. We also announced the appointment of Kevin Will, Chief Product Officer of OpenAI to Cisco's Board of Directors yesterday. These announcements further our confidence in Cisco's long-term success and durability in the era of AI. To summarize the quarter, we are seeing clear demand for our technology across our customer markets.Our innovation pipeline continues to accelerate as we view security deep into our networking products, and our strong performance is fueling our capital allocation model, returning significant value to our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Scott for more detail on the quarter and our outlook. R. Scott Herren Thanks, Chuck. We delivered a strong quarter with revenue and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance ranges, coupled with solid margins and operating cash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was $14.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.96. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail.Total product revenue was $10.4 billion, up 15% and services revenue was $3.8 billion, up 3%. Networking was up 8%, with growth across most of the portfolio, led by double-digit growth in switching and enterprise routing, partially offset by a decline in servers. Security was up 54%, primarily driven by growth in our offerings from Splunk and Sassy. Collaboration was up 4%, driven by growth in Devices, WebEx suite and our CPaaS offerings and observability was up 24%. Looking at our recurring metrics.Total ARR ended the quarter at $30.6 billion, an increase of 5% with product ARR growth of 8%. Total subscription revenue increased 15% to $7.9 billion and represents 56% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 25% at $5.6 billion, with software subscription revenue up 26%. Total RPO was $41.7 billion, up 7%. Product RPO grew 10% and total short-term RPO and was $21.1 billion, up 5%.Q3 product orders were up 20% year-over-year, excluding Splunk, product orders were up 9% year-over-year. Looking at product orders across our geographic segments. Americas was up 27%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was up 21%.In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 32%, Enterprise was up 22% and public sector was up 8% Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.6%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 67.6%, up 70 basis points driven by productivity improvements and Splunk, partially offset by pricing.Non-GAAP services gross margin was 71.3%, down 30 basis points. The impact of tariffs on our gross margin was favorable to what was estimated in the guidance we provided last quarter. We continue our focus on profitability and financial discipline with non-GAAP operating margin at 34.5%, above the high end of our guidance range.We recorded a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the quarter, which was favorable by 1.5-percentage-points compared to what was assumed in our guidance, primarily due to an increase in tax benefit from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and onetime benefits. Shifting to the balance sheet.We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15.6 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 2%, primarily driven by revenue and earnings growth. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.5 billion of share repurchases with $15.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase program.We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we closed the acquisition of SnapAttack, which adds capability to Splunk and helping organizations power the security operations center of the future.To summarize, we had another solid quarter with top and bottom line performance exceeding our expectations, driven by strong order growth and margins. We remain focused on making strategic investments in innovation across our business to best capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead, all underpinned by disciplined spend management. It's this powerful combination that continues to fuel our strong cash flow generation as well as our ability to return significant value to our shareholders.Turning to guidance. While we've seen some progress on tariffs, there continues to be uncertainty our guide assumes current tariffs and exemptions remain in place through the quarter. These include the following: China at 30%, partially offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components.Mexico and Canada at 25% for the components and products that are not eligible for the current US MCA exemptions. Other countries at a base rate of 10% until the end of the 90-day pause on July 9 and then reverting to country-specific reciprocal tariffs partly offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components.And finally, a small impact from tariffs on steel and aluminum and retaliatory tariffs. We'll continue to leverage our world-class supply chain team to help mitigate the impact where appropriate through the flexibility and agility we have built into our operations over the last few years. The size and scale of our supply chain provides us some unique advantages as we support our customers globally.For fiscal Q4, our guidance is we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.5 billion to $14.7 billion, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67.5% to 68.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.96 to $0.98, and we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18%.For the full year fiscal '25, our guidance is -- we expect revenue to be in the range of $56.5 billion to $56.7 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.77 to $3.79. Sami let's now move into the Q&A. Ahmed Sami Badri Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue. Operator Meta Marshall, Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall Great. And congrats on the quarter. Maybe the two questions for me. Just one, what are you seeing in terms of customer buying behavior right now, just given the uncertainty kind of with some of the tariffs that you laid out and just whether you kind of saw any pull forward potentially in April. And then just maybe as a second question, just any commentary around public sector and federal kind of around the same questions. Charles Robbins Yes, Meta, thank you. I'm going to -- I'll give you some commentary, and then I'm going to ask Scott to give you some data points on this pull-ahead issue. But I'd say from a customer behavior perspective, first of all, we haven't seen any meaningful change in how and they're purchasing. And so we haven't seen any customers really fundamentally slowing down. They're still committed to the technology transition.I think the AI transition is just so important they're going to continue to spend until they just absolutely have to stop. And I think that as of right now, they're still comfortable. As it relates to pull forwards, look, I think I'm sure there was an order here or there from a customer who decided to pull something forward because they were concerned about tariffs.But we looked at a ton of data points to see if we saw any signs of broad-based pull ahead business, and we did not. And I'm going to ask Scott real quick to share some of those data points, and then I'll answer the public sector. R. Scott Herren Thanks, Chuck. And I should remind you, too, Meta, that we didn't motivate a lot of pull ahead by talking about price increases. If you remember, the way we talked about the impact of tariffs to us, we had a number of levers. We have a great world-class supply chain team. Once the tariff scenario stabilizes, there are steps that we can take to mitigate it, as you've seen us do with the China tariffs from the first Trump administration.And only after that, would we consider pricing. So we didn't build a strong motivation. But we looked at -- after speaking to our channel partners who also didn't see any buy ahead or delay behavior by the way, and our own sales team, we looked at channel inventory, which you would think would go up. It did not. It actually was down.We worked closely with the web scalers we understand not just what they have on order, but what they have on hand. Actually, web scaler inventory on hand went down during the quarter. We looked at Meraki activations. We know when a serial number x leaves the factory floor and when it gets activated when we had built up some inventory at our customers, you recall that period of time between shipment and activation extended. It's stayed right where it was, which is back in line with where it was pre pandemic. So there's no indication there.Of course, we look at linearity and in particular, to see if we saw a spike in the third month, which, if you recall, the (technical difficulty) tariffs were announced on April 2. And so if there was some buy-ahead activity, we would have seen a heavier month. We did not see that. We saw the exact same linearity that we had seen historically there.We look at our pipeline for pull-ahead or push outs, nothing out of the ordinary there. And I'd say the last metric is we look at when a customer orders today but request a future ship date. There's always a little bit of that that happens. But we look to see was there a pattern of a lot of orders that came in with a future ship date, and there was nothing out of the ordinary either. So we really don't see any signs of any notable pull ahead or for that matter, push out. Charles Robbins Sami, let me cover the public sector. So just -- I know we put this in the corresponding slides, I think, but Global Public Sector was up 8%. If you just look at the organic growth, it was up 3% globally. We saw -- in the US, we saw strength in federal ironically. So we saw a double-digit order growth in US Federal this quarter. And candidly, that was with our biggest deal slipping out.So that was positive. I would say there still continues to be stress on the civilian side obviously, with agencies that have been shut down with employees who are worried about their jobs, there's a lot of just human capital concern on the civilian side, but it's also important to remember that that's about a quarter of our federal business, 75% of it is intelligence and Department of Defense. So overall, we were pleased with public sector during the quarter. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, can we go to the next analyst. Operator Tal Liani, Bank of America. Tal Liani So this year, Meta is growing CapEx by 70%, and you see very strong growth across the board. And the question is I know you're only now ramping networking, but the question is whether 2025, you think is a peak year. CapEx will likely slow down materially slow down. What happens to Cisco in an environment where cloud CapEx is slowing down? Charles Robbins First of all, I don't know that I would suggest that the cloud CapEx, particularly on a global basis, as you see the announcements that were made in the Middle East this week, we're seeing sovereign cloud strategies being built around the world. So I think on a global basis, I don't think that will be the case.And talking to these customers, I don't anticipate that they have a huge demand for slowing down. I think that you may see a different balance between their investments on capital to serve enterprise customers leveraging these models through inference and other things. But I don't anticipate it's going to be that 2025 is going to be a peak year. I think this has many years to run. R. Scott Herren And Tal, just to remind you on the tail end of building out all the public cloud infrastructure for training, there's a significantly larger opportunity in enterprise AI, right, as they build out the capability to do inferencing inside their own data centers. So I think there's a -- in aggregate, the AI opportunity has several years to run at this point. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers And congrats on the quarter and Scott on the future retirement. I guess I'll ask my kind of two quick questions in conjunction here. So I want to -- I think, Chuck, in the prepared comments, you referenced a large sovereign deployment opportunity that is coming here soon. I guess the first question on that is that is that currently in your order book, the $600 million you saw this last quarter? And if not, how do you think about the size of those opportunities?And then a quick follow-on is I think this last quarter, you launched or you started shipping your 51.2 (technical difficulty) I think it's the G200 silicon. Can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in the data center switching side and if that really becomes a catalyst year as we look out over the next couple of quarters? Charles Robbins Yes. Thanks, Aaron. So I think you're referencing the HUMAIN announcement that we made yesterday or the Saudis made early this week, they announced the creation of this company. We've been working with them on this for months and the short answer is there's absolutely no orders in the $600 million from them. They are just getting started.We've got a team of people returning to the Middle East next week to spend more time with them. I think it's important to note on HUMAIN, the CEO there is an individual named Tareq Amin and just to you some background on Tareq he was the CTO at Reliance Jio when we built that network with them over the course of several years.And then he was the CEO of Rakuten when we built with him the Open RAN mobile network in Japan. And so we've been engaged with Tareq since he actually moved into Saudi Arabia and he is a good friend, an old friend. We've been doing large-scale projects with them for a dozen years now.So he knows us. We know him well, and we're looking forward to that opportunity. So I think that's not included in any of our forecasts from our sales teams or anything at this point. On the second point, the G200 chip, I would say it is at the heart of the any of these systems orders. So I made a comment that of the $600 million-plus, two thirds of it was systems, and those systems would be based on the G200, and I would tell you that right now, those customers are telling us that they -- if we could get more capacity out, they would buy more.So it's actually doing well right now. And we've got a number of other chips that are in various stages of the process for the next-generation platforms that we're also looking forward to. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan Joseph Cardoso This is Joseph Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. I also wanted to follow up on the Middle East announcements. Maybe a two-parter here is just, can you elaborate on how Cisco is looking to participate here, particularly as it relates to the portfolio? And I know it's early days, but any early insights that you can share into the timing and magnitude of these opportunities for the company as kind of investors are looking to embed it potentially into the model? And then I have a follow-up. Charles Robbins You want to go ahead and ask your follow-up, Joe, we'll just get them both. Joseph Cardoso Yes, sure. And the follow-up is actually just more on the enterprise vertical, particularly campus. Obviously, orders are coming in good on the enterprise vertical. But just curious if you could what are you hearing from customers on this front and the momentum that you're seeing in kind of the order backlog order backlog here and how you're thinking about the opportunity around the recovery relative to when we last put 90 days ago. Charles Robbins Okay. So on the Middle East front, I will just tell you that Tareq made a comment to me that they're behind and they're going to catch up. So I think they're going to spend a lot of money, and I think they're going to spend it as quickly as they possibly can. It's hundreds of billions of dollars at the end of the day that they will be spending. If you go to the HUMAIN their website and scroll down, they list their initial strategic partners.So you can see, but our discussions with them have been around the networking, compute, security, and observability. So that represents a pretty good opportunity for us. And I think there'll be as big as any of the major web scalers in the United States is how I would think about it.On the enterprise campus front, yes, we saw strong orders in campus switching. We saw the triple-digit sequential growth in orders for Wi-Fi 7. We saw really strong growth in our enterprise routing portfolio this quarter.So we still see customers investing heavily in modernizing their infrastructure. And the general belief and feedback that we're getting from these customers is as they get ready to roll out a genetic AI, in particular, the network is absolutely going to be key because of the real-time nature of this communication, and they all want to make sure that while they may not know exactly what those applications are going to look like right now.They absolutely know they're going to need the most modern networks they can have. And I think that's what's driving it right now. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator Michael Ng, Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng Congratulations, Scott, on the upcoming retirement. I really appreciate all your time and help throughout the years. As it relates to my two questions. First, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the networking orders strength in the quarter. How much of that was the broad recovery and things like campus how much did the product cycle of Wi-Fi 7 contribute?And could we expect that to continue over the next 12 to 18 months here or so. And then second, just a housekeeping question. I was wondering if you could just share the organic revenue growth rates for the company and the segment ex Splunk, if you have that off hand. Charles Robbins Okay. I think on the networking order strength, I think it was across the board. As I was saying earlier, I think we saw it in the enterprise switching space, we saw it in -- we saw growth in data center switching. We saw it in we saw strong growth in enterprise routing.We saw that triple-digit sequential growth in Wi-Fi 7. I do think, to your point, it's a 12- to 18-month cycle. I think once the -- once customers begin this, I mean it's just -- it's a standard upgrade cycle that we see -- that we've seen historically. I think the way to think about it is we've talked about the fact that there's a window and there's sort of a time frame where we typically deliver refreshed products, whether it's the Wi-Fi portfolio or the campus switching portfolio.And so when that begins as well, then that will also enhance that ongoing opportunity, I think, as we go to -- as we look to the future. So Scott, do you want to talk a little bit of organic rep? R. Scott Herren Yes. And Michael, thanks for the comments and for the question. First of all, I should say, Splunk is performing in line with or actually slightly ahead of our expectations on both revenue and profitability, consistent with what we told you last quarter. The integration has gone really well. The people side of integration is pretty much complete at this point across all functions.The product integration continues to go along well. And this is the quarter that we actually lapped the acquisition during Q3. And so at this point, it's part of the run rate. I don't really plan on breaking out organic versus inorganic from this point forward. It gets harder and harder given the level of integration we've done across the board to split that out.So not really planning on giving that data point given that it's just part of our overall run rate at this point. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator Matthew Niknam, Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam And Scott, thank you again for all your help over these last couple of years. My question is on web scale. So obviously, you continue to see very impressive growth here. Maybe, Chuck, if you can talk to what's driving some of the sustained success, the pace of transition away from InfiniBand towards Ethernet and maybe some of the bigger differentiators that are helping you win incremental share across these hyperscalers? Charles Robbins Yes. Thanks, Matthew. Look, I think it's been the intent of these customers from day one to move away from InfiniBand. And the gating factor was held soon did they feel good about the technology. And they feel very good about the technology and how it's enabling them to run these training models over native Ethernet or some enhanced Ethernet that we are delivering.I think that we've talked over the last few years about their desire to have silicon diversity, which we think was one of the key reasons that we got in originally. And now we're delivering high-quality products in the time frame they need the -- if you look at what they're looking for in these products from their partners, there's really sort of -- you have a system that has software and has silicon and then other components.And the real high-value pieces of this are the operating system and the silicon. And as many of them are transitioning hard into running their own proprietary operating systems on these platforms, it's imperative that you have silicon if you want to be competitive long term in this space. And so we're very fortunate that we made the acquisition in 2016.We have a great team that's been developing Silicon One. They're very close to these customers. They work with them every day. And I think the silicon is the key differentiator that's really -- I mean, we're delivering high-quality systems and everything else that they want the services, the experience, the supply chain, all those things that matter deeply.But at the end of the day, if we didn't have the Silicon it would probably make it virtually impossible for us to be successful long term here. Ahmed Sami Badri We move to the next analyst. Operator Amit Daryanani, Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani I guess I have two as well. Starting with your AI orders at $1 billion. It came in, I think, a quarter ahead of what you had expected and it looks like you're seeing some continued momentum as you go forward with sovereign and enterprise that you talked about. I'm just wondering, how should we think about the growth rates as we move forward on AI orders or AI revenues? It would be helpful to just kind of phase that out-- frame that out a little bit in terms of the forward growth rates.And then if I could just follow up for Scott, your July quarter guide, cut, if I'm not mistaken, it implies revenues are up sequentially, but operating margins are down 50 basis points. Maybe just push out why the margins are coming down in July, while revenues are going up and best luck in your retirement as well. Charles Robbins On the AI orders, how do you think about the growth? I would say just one thing to remember is that these are big customers that are -- and these orders are nonlinear in nature. So we'll see how it goes. But I mean last quarter, we did 350 or something like that. This quarter, we exceeded 600.And as I said earlier, if we could actually -- if we could increase capacity, they would take more. So I think if we're able to execute and increase capacity, we should be able to continue to see this ramp as long as we're delivering and executing, which is one thing I've said all along is we have to execute because if we miss with these customers, then we sit on the sidelines for a while.So we -- the teams are working really hard and I think that's how I think about it. It's nonlinear orders. And as long -- if we can continue to increase the capacity, then we'll continue to see that business improve. Scott, do you want to talk about July? R. Scott Herren Sure. Yes. And you're doing the math right, Amit, first of all, thanks for what you said. You're doing the math right on margins. The biggest difference you can see it's actually in the gross margin line, and that falls through to the op margin line.And that's really a full quarter and I laid out the assumptions for you in the opening commentary on tariffs. It's a full quarter of the tariffs being in effect, and we reflected the full cost without mitigation and that's the big driver that we see sequentially going from Q3 to Q4. Still feel good about putting up the midpoint of the guide at 11% EPS growth. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next caller. Operator Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Simon Leopold I'll ask both upfront. The first one is, Chuck, I think last quarter, you had sort of alluded to an upcoming campus refresh. And I would think Cisco's sort of do. What I'd like some help with is understanding the maybe historic perspective of when you've had these refreshes how to think about that? Because when I reflect on the last one, 2017, 2018, that occurred when you were shifting customers to subscription.So I feel like that's a tough metric to use to understand the potential. And then the follow-up may be a bit simpler, which is how do we think about the impact of tariffs, understanding they're changing every day. But given everything we know, after July 9, what would be the effect of tariffs based on the July 9 end of the pause? Charles Robbins Yes, Simon, I think you -- first of all, I think your point relative to the 2017 kickoff of the campus refresh is a very valid one. So it's hard to say. We've also seen some strength over the last 12 months in the enterprise campus business. So here's what I would tell you, though, as we look to really drive this over the next 12, 24 months, I think that what's most important to our customers right now is that we embed security deep into the network.And so what you're going to see is you're going to see a focus on enabling agentic AI and enabling security and security services in the network so that our customers can do this in line, which is going to be necessary for us to solve the AI problem. I'll tell you, I had a discussion with a Cisco of a Fortune 100 company a couple of weeks ago, G2 and I were together.And we started talking about security and she stopped us and said, listen, if you can't paint a picture for me, define an architecture for me, multiyear architecture that has me removing every physical firewall for my infrastructure that I want to talk to you because if it's not embedded in the traffic flows, it's never going to happen. It's not going to work. And so what I would tell you on this is just envision that we're going to deploy security everywhere out through the network infrastructure. And that plus AI, I think, will give customers reasons to really look at these platforms. R. Scott Herren Yes. And Simon, on your second question on the impact of tariffs after July 9. I mentioned in the opening commentary that we've built into our forecast that underpins the guide for Q4 an expectation that on July 9, those that exempt that pause ends and we go back to the reciprocal tariffs that were announced on April 2 with the two exemptions, the US MCA exemption still in place and the semiconductor and certain electronic component exemption still in place. So we've reflected that in the guide for Q4.I think it's a little bit hard right now to predict what is going to happen on July 9 and what agreements get put in place between now and then. But just wanted to protect the downside in the guide. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator James Fish, Piper Sandler. James Fish Nice quarter. And Scott, congrats on your upcoming retirement here. And look, I don't want to rain on the freight here. But if I look at networking here, it returned to growth, but it was also against a very easy compare and even still down versus a couple of years ago. If AI really isn't substitutionary of existing non-AI networking real estate with some of these web scales and enterprise is growing the rates are calling out, why isn't this sort of growing faster than even the 8% on the comp here?And then just following up on Simon's question before, as my follow-up. Can we just an update as to the exposure between data center versus campus within networking? And how we should think about the price per port kind of playing out here as we're seven, eight years now down the road? Charles Robbins On the first one, I think the short answer is that most of this AI infrastructure has not begun to flow through revenue yet. Scott, I don't know if you want to. R. Scott Herren That's right. We said all along that we thought the -- when we put the $1 billion target out for the year, that was a sales target, not a revenue target, but we said we thought that would begin to convert to revenue in the second half of the year. And we saw that again, the first piece of that in Q3, and we expect to see a bit of it again in Q4. Charles Robbins And I think on the data center versus campus, clearly, the data center with a higher speed, you're going to see a higher per port cost, but you're going to see much higher volumes in the campus. So I think they sort of normalize each other out over time. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator David Vogt, UBS. David Vogt This is Andrew for David. I wanted to ask a question about the text of the $600 million of AI orders. You mentioned that they tend to be nonlinear and they're very large customers. I'm wondering if you're starting to see bigger orders is a large component of that $600 million and with the customers where you're having the most success? Or are you really seeing sort of a diffuse kind of large growing orders across a number of customers that you mentioned you had three going triple digits.And the follow-up question I wanted to ask is just -- I'm not sure if I missed it, but could you give an estimate of roughly what you think the impact of tariffs are in your guidance for Q4 for gross margin? Charles Robbins Yes, Andrew, I think you nailed it. You almost answered the question for us. I mean we have three of the six that grew triple digits. So I think it's fairly balanced. I would tell you that we when I would look at these customers, we're seeing acceleration across all of them.So it's all positive, but there are -- in this case, we had three that were just super high growers next quarter, maybe a different there. So we'll see, but it's pretty balanced. R. Scott Herren And then on your question on the tariff impact and the what I wanted to do is make sure you understood the assumptions that were built into it. So we walked through those China at 30%, Mexico and Canada, where it's not eligible for the USMCA exemption at 25%, 10% everywhere else until July 9 and then reverting back to the reciprocal tariffs and then a small impact on us for the tariffs on steel and alumina and retaliatory. That's all built into the guide. I haven't broken out and quantified the dollar value that goes with that and I'm a little reluctant to it because the puck keeps moving on this.What I wanted you to understand is that everything that we know today, the impact of those has been built into the guide for Q4. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator Karl Ackerman, BNP Paribas. Karl Ackerman I have two, and I'll just ask them at the same time as well, please. So the extended partnership with NVIDIA is an endorsement of your Silicon One family and certainly underscores your opportunity as enterprises deploy AI compute. I was hoping you could quantify your AI orders for enterprise at our incremental to the $1 billion of AI order target you have for cloud. And then second, when might Silicon One offer co-packaged optics solutions as you seek to broaden your data center switch offering. Charles Robbins Yes. Thanks, Karl. I would say -- first of all, I'd say the NVIDIA partnership, we've had a couple of phases of the announcements and a lot of the solutions that we're going to deliver to the enterprise are still to be delivered. So most of them start rolling out like 60 days from now, and then they'll just -- they'll be flowing after that. So first thing I want to just clarify is we haven't seen a lot of upside yet in the enterprise from that.I would say the enterprise AI orders is a little more difficult for us to flag these, but we have been trying to do so, so that we have a baseline. And what I will tell you is that we're definitely seeing acceleration, it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars, not in the billions yet that we're seeing. But again, there's a lot of dependence on the sales force flagging these things properly when you get into that scale with the number of enterprise customers that we have.On the Silicon One CPO question, I think it's important to remember that we've demonstrated CPO in 2023. And at the time, there wasn't a significant amount of customer demand for it for lots of reasons. But we have a team of people that are working on it. We will embrace it. I think that it's going to be driven by customer desire and I think that's going to be driven by a combination of power benefit as well as speed requirements. And as soon as customers are asking for it, we'll be first in market ready to deliver it. Ahmed Sami Badri We can move to the next analyst. Operator Atif Malik, Citi. Adrienne Colby It's Adrienne Colby for Atif. It's been a while since you talked about your AI pipeline versus your AI orders. So I was hoping you could update us on what that part of the funnel is looking like. And secondly, I was hoping with the departure of parcel you could update us on the search there for a new head of go-to-market. Charles Robbins Yes. So we -- correct me if I'm wrong, Scott. We don't give out pipeline for AI at this point. So we did that a long time ago. And again, it was the $1 billion target in the pipeline stuff was really to give you all more confidence that we were serious in this space. And I think the results have now said that these customers are taking us seriously.So we won't be doing all that on an ongoing basis. And then, yes, we named a new head of go-to-market, Oliver Tuszik, who was most recently running our Europe, Middle East, Africa region and before that was running our global partner organization. When before he came to Cisco, he was a CEO of a partner. So he has a really deep understanding of our go-to-market model and we announced him a week ago. Ahmed Sami Badri Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator Sebastien Naji, William Blair. Sebastien Naji I wanted to ask about your networking business and in particular, your hyperscaler customers, and in particular, the usage of a white box given that Cisco can provide that broad range of offerings from the chip to white box to the full system. Can you maybe just comment on whether you see white box eating up a big part of the spending pie? And is it AI that's driving that share shift or something else that's happening? Charles Robbins Well, what I would say is that I don't think we've seen a meaningful shift between what they buy from us versus when they buy white boxes. To your point, when they want to buy white boxes, we can work with them to actually integrate our silicon and actually manage the process for them and help deliver that product. But we see the predominance is still buying systems.And I think it's just up to -- every hyperscaler has a different set of kind of issues that lead them to the answer. And in some cases, some of them have had an answer two years ago that now has changed, and they're doing it a different way. So I'm not sure there's a real clean answer across the customer base. R. Scott Herren Yes. And just a quick reminder, Sebastian, we said this earlier, but of the more than $600 million in orders that we took during Q3. Two thirds of those were systems as opposed to optics and optical. So we're seeing the shift to systems that we had predicted in the Q2 call. Ahmed Sami Badri Thank you, Sebastian. I'm now going to hand it over back to Chuck for some closing remarks. Charles Robbins Yes. Let me just thank all of you again for joining and reiterate that how pleased I am with our progress and how proud I am of what our teams have done. I'd also like to once again thank Scott. He's been a great partner for me for the last five years helping drive the transition.And as I said earlier, dealing with some pretty complex situations over the years. I'm excited to have Mark step into the role. Mark and I have worked closely together for 18 years. So we -- he has a great set of experiences here at Cisco and will bring a lot into the role.As we look ahead, I think the AI opportunity for us, we believe, is a strong one. We think we're well positioned. We believe that because we -- from a technology and a portfolio perspective, we play across the full stack. We have networking, we have security, we have Silicon, which I think are all very important.We have secure AI solutions that we're delivering in the marketplace. We also have the partnerships and the investments. We have the NVIDIA partnership, which is delivering critical solutions for our customers. This week, we announced the HUMAIN partnership the AIP investments, the G42 partnership, and there are more to come.And I think the other thing we have is we have global presence, we have customer trust, we have the ability to understand both the cloud customers as well as the enterprise customers and the public sector customers. So when it gets when these sovereign clouds are being discussed, we have a unique perspective across all of those segments. We understand what they need in long-term partnerships. We have a great team that are delivering right now, strong execution and great results. I'm really proud of what they've done.So I look forward to talking to you soon. And Sami, I'll hand it back to you. Ahmed Sami Badri Thank you, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 results will be on Wednesday, August 13, 2025, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call.If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.

        "header": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2030",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), with a market cap of more than $3 trillion, is now one of the three largest companies in the world. This is not a fluke. The chip maker's control of the data center GPU market is estimated at around 90%. Its GPUs are widely considered the best in the world, as evidenced both by its high market share and its market-leadinggross margins. The AI revolution literally runs on these GPUs, and Nvidia's dominance in the data center GPU space gives it a front-row seat to AI's long-term growth. Over time, however, competition will take its toll. It may take years, but eventually, Nvidia's market share will shrink. And long before that, we should see pricing pressure reduce its gross margins. All of this doesn't make it a poor long-term investment. In fact, Nvidia shares might bevery cheapright now despite the threat of long-term competitive pressures. But like any market, competition will eventually appear, giving huge upside potential to the AI stock below. There is no doubt that Nvidia's GPUs are king right now. Rival chipmakers likeIntelandAMDnot only have far lower market shares in data center GPUs, but also dramatically lower gross margins -- an indicator that their chips don't command nearly the same premiums that Nvidia's do. A decade ago, Intel actually had higher gross margins than Nvidia. But thanks to the tech sector's unquenchable demand for AI accelerator chips, Nvidia is now posting some of the highest gross margins ever seen in the semiconductor industry. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. Competitors have noticed. Beyond Nvidia's traditional foes like Intel and AMD, an array of global competitors and well-funded start-ups are seeking to replicate its success. Over the long term, the performance advantages Nvidia's chips offer should diminish on a relative basis, cutting into its pricing power and leading to lower gross margins. Which companies will benefit from this chip industry war? Giant data center operators likeAmazon(AMZN-0.61%). By the end of this decade, it won't be surprising if the tech giant has a higher market cap than Nvidia due to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division alone. Image Source: Getty Images. People usually think of Amazon first as an e-commerce business. That's understandable: The online sales division is responsible for most of the company's revenues. But when it comes to its profits, Amazon Web Services reigns supreme. In recent quarters, AWS has provided more than half of Amazon's total operating profits. The division has consistently been posting its highest profit margins in years, fueled by overwhelming demand for its cloud computing network -- demand that is a direct result of the rising use of AI and the tech world's efforts to rapidly develop better models. Right now, AWS is to cloud computing as Nvidia is to data center GPUs. It has a dominant 30% global market share, with industry-leading profit margins to match. It has nearly as much market share in cloud infrastructure as its two nearest competitors combined. And while it is a major buyer of Nvidia's products, it is, at the end of the day, fairly agnostic to the chip wars. It will buy whatever chips its own customers demand to power their software. If more competition emerges in the AI accelerator space, AWS will have the ability to buy cheaper chips from more manufacturers -- a big deal considering that Nvidia's pricey chips also come with wait times of up to 12 months right now, which limits the ability of AWS to scale up in parallel with customer demand. Some analysts believe that AWS alone could eventually be worth $3 trillion -- which is roughly Nvidia's current market cap. Add in the value of its other businesses, and the case for Amazon outpacing the chipmaker becomes obvious. Competition in the AI chip space will emerge in full force this decade, and AWS should benefit. So don't be surprised to see Amazon's valuation exceed Nvidia's based on its cloud segment's long-term success.",

        "header": "Innoviz Technologies Ltd (INVZ) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Record Revenues and Strategic ...",
        "content": "Release Date: May 14, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to thefull earnings call transcript. Innoviz Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:INVZ) reported record revenues of $17.4 million for Q1 2025, marking a nearly threefold increase sequentially and 2.5 times year-over-year growth. The company achieved a gross margin of approximately 40%, the highest in its history, supported by positive contributions from NREs. Innoviz Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:INVZ) has expanded its NRE payment plan from $80 million to $95 million, with significant cash payments expected in 2025 and 2026, indicating strong customer commitment. The strategic partnership with Fabinet is expected to efficiently scale production of the Innovvi2 platform, enhancing manufacturing capabilities globally. Innoviz Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:INVZ) is experiencing strong momentum in the automotive sector, with significant collaborations, including an expanded partnership with Nvidia on the Hyperion platform. Despite the record revenues, the company's operating expenses for Q1 2025 were approximately $21 million, which, although reduced from the previous year, still represent a significant cost. The gross margin improvement is largely attributed to NREs, which may not be sustainable at the same level in the future, leading to potential fluctuations. The company's revenue expectations for 2025 are back-loaded, indicating potential volatility and dependency on customer timelines. There is uncertainty regarding the impact of US tariffs, which could affect future operations despite current minimal impact. Innoviz Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:INVZ) faces competitive pressures in the autonomous driving market, requiring continuous technological advancements to maintain its leadership position. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with INVZ. Q: What is Innoviz's market position in the RoboTaxi sector, especially with the recent VW announcement and other partnerships?A: Innoviz is working with strong platform players like Mobilize, which is gaining partners such as Volkswagen, Holon, and Verner. The recent Uber and Volkswagen deal is expected to allow faster scaling. The removal of limitations on autonomous taxis in the U.S. has started a race among companies to capture city markets. Innoviz's early presence in this space, with its LiDAR technology, positions it as a significant player in the RoboTaxi market. (Respondent: CEO) Q: Can you explain the strong gross margin in Q1 and what can be expected from NRE programs in the future?A: The Q1 gross margin was 40%, significantly influenced by NREs, which positively impact margins. While such high margins may not be consistent, positive and relatively high margins can be expected when NREs are involved. The unevenness in margins is due to the relative percentage of NRE versus unit sales. (Respondent: CFO) Q: How are tariffs impacting Innoviz, and what measures are in place to mitigate any potential effects?A: Innoviz's products do not fall under the 25% tariff category as they are automotive components. The impact is expected to be minimal to none. Additionally, Innoviz's partner, Fabinet, has facilities worldwide, providing flexibility to address any future tariff issues.

        "content": "Thenew US-China trade thawhasn't shaken Wall Street's biggest bear. \"We continue to see a recession as our base case. Although tariffs have come down, the effective US tariff rate is still the highest since the 1930s. The US economy was also on a weaker footing than widely believed even before the trade war began,\" BCA Research chief strategistPeter Berezinwarned in a new note. \"Stocks are not pricing in much recession risk, which suggests that a cautious stance towards equities is warranted.\" Berezin gained attention for being the lone bear on Wall Street coming into 2025 and sporting the lowest price target on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at 4,450. His bearish call on stocks has mostly been right, at least up to therecent rally after the market tanked post-\"Liberation Day.\"And on the economy, US GDP contracted 0.3% in the first quarter. In 2022, Berezin also correctly called that there would be no US recession, despite most on the Street bracing for one. He's been an economist for more than 30 years, with stints at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Goldman Sachs, and now BCA Research. In his latest note, Berezin did take his recession probability odds down to 60% from 75%. But he points to weakness in the labor market and consumer spending during a time of considerable tariff fears as key reasons for his economic concerns. \"If existing tariff rates remain in place, they will reduce disposable income for the median US household by about 2%, with larger effects for lower-income families,\" Berezin explains. Listen:Why the tariff thaw isn't super bullish for stocks He reiterated a call for the S&P 500 to plunge 25% from current levels to end 2025 at 4,450, backed up by his cautious view on the US economy. \"While not our base case, we would assign 30% odds to a major fiscal crisis this year \u2014 one that takes the 10-year Treasury yield north of 6%,\" Berezin added. This comes as the markets are moving back up and to the right. TheUS and China agreed on Mondayto ratchet down the tariff war for 90 days as each economy begins to feel the pressure of bruising penalties. After a weekend of high-level meetings in Switzerland, the US will reduce \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods from China to 10% from 125%. A separate 20% tariff imposed by Trump over what he says is China's role in the fentanyl trade will remain intact. China will cut its retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%. The S&P 500 reversed its losses on the year on Tuesday but gave back some gains on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) entered a new bull market on Monday. The \"Magnificent Seven\" complex \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG) \u2014 areback leading the market higherin a clear show of renewed risk appetite. Watch:Charles Schwab's CEO has a message to new investors But to Berezin's point, thetrade war with Chinais far from finished. \"Well, I don't think it will ever quite be over, but what will be over are these tariffs up over 100%,\" billionaire businessman and longtime Trump confidant Wilbur Ross told me on Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bidpodcast (see video above). Ross added, \"There's probably always a 20% or 25% chance of recession, and it's been many years since we had a real recession. COVID, you have to put to the side because that was not an economic recession \u2014 that had to do with the horrible epidemic. So it's been a long time, and we're therefore due for a recession at some point.\" Brian Sozziis Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on X@BrianSozzi,Instagram, andLinkedIn.

The Moline, Ill.-based tractor and lawn mower maker reported earnings per share of $6.64 on revenue that declined 16% year-over-year to $12.76 billion. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $5.60 and $12.37 billion, respectively.

        "content": "SoundHound AI Inc.SOUN has experienced a remarkable 20.7% surge in its stock price since reporting its first-quarter 2025 earnings last week on May 8, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s rise of 7.8% and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry\u2019s increase of 4.2%. This uptick reflects growing investor confidence in the company's trajectory within the voice AI sector. SOUN\u2019s Post Q1 Share Performance Image Source: Zacks Investment Research If we look into the maker of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for computer interpretation of voice commands\u2019 recent quarterly results, its revenues of $29.1 million marked a staggering 151% increase year over year. This growth underscores the company's expanding footprint in the voice AI domain. However, it's noteworthy that this figure fell slightly short of analysts' expectations, which anticipated $30 million in revenues. On the earnings front, SoundHound posted an adjusted loss of 6 cents per share, outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents per share. This narrower loss indicates improved operational efficiency and cost management. Yet, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $22.2 million, widening from a loss of $15.4 million, reflecting continued investment in growth and R&D.The company reaffirmed its 2025 revenue guidance of $157 to $177 million, reflecting continued confidence in demand for its voice AI solutions. If achieved, this would represent a growth rate of approximately 85\u2013109% over 2024 levels. The reaffirmation suggests management\u2019s visibility into its sales pipeline and execution capacity remains strong despite macroeconomic headwinds.However, despite strong revenue growth, SoundHound\u2019s margins declined, with GAAP gross margin falling to 36.5% from 59.7% and non-GAAP margin declining to 50.8% from 65.5%, reflecting elevated costs tied to acquisitions and scaling. This suggests operational efficiencies have not yet caught up with top-line expansion.Let's delve deeper into the company's prospects to determine whether SOUN stock is a prudent addition to your portfolio now. SoundHound\u2019s stand-out quarterly revenue growth reflects the momentum behind the company\u2019s enterprise AI solutions and its expanding industry footprint. A key highlight is the diversification of its customer base, with no single customer accounting for more than 10% of total revenues, underscoring broader market adoption of SoundHound\u2019s voice AI technologies across sectors such as automotive, healthcare, financial services, and restaurants.SoundHound\u2019s Polaris multilingual AI foundation model underpinned its competitive edge, with superior latency, accuracy, and multi-language capabilities enabling traction across international markets. The company activated more than 1,000 restaurant locations during the first quarter, nearly 10 times its pace a year ago, and its AI now handles around 10 million interactions per quarter across 13,000 restaurants. The company\u2019s collaborations with major players such asNVIDIANVDA, Perplexity,Lucid Group, Inc.LCID and LG, along with restaurant industry partners, are key tailwinds. These partnerships underscore SoundHound\u2019s leadership in creating transformative voice solutions. SoundHound has expanded its collaboration with NVIDIA by integrating NVIDIA AI Enterprise tools to enhance its voice AI capabilities. This partnership enables faster, low-latency processing, real-time retrieval-augmented generation, and scalable AI model optimization. The integration is already being used in automotive applications, such as Lucid Motors' voice assistant, to improve response times and user interactions. SoundHound AI plans to broaden the use of NVIDIA AI software in more modules to further advance automotive voice technology.The company\u2019s standout first-quarter performance was fueled by rapid expansion across core verticals\u2014restaurants, automotive, and enterprise. SoundHound is amplifying its go-to-market capabilities through high-impact partnerships. These include tie-ups with Acrelec (restaurant tech), PowerConnect.AI (energy), and Pindrop (security), along with renewals from global IT, telecom, and hospitality players. In the automotive sector, SoundHound partnered withTencent\u2019s TCEHY Tencent Intelligent Mobility\u2014part of Tencent\u2019s Cloud and Smart Industries Group\u2014to integrate its advanced conversational AI into intelligent cockpit systems for global automobile brands. A new alliance with Tencent and growing adoption of its voice commerce solution further amplified automotive traction. Additionally, new partnerships in the energy and utility sectors, such as with Power Connect AI, indicate strategic market diversification.These alliances not only diversify revenue streams but also help scale the company\u2019s platform into new domains with low incremental cost. Recent acquisitions\u2014SYNQ3, Amelia, and Allset\u2014contributed meaningfully in the quarter. These integrations enhanced upsell opportunities, cross-functional capabilities, and technological breadth. Amelia 7.0, powered by SoundHound\u2019s new Agentic Plus framework, allows deployment of autonomous AI agents for voice-driven transactions and customer support, ushering in real-time commercial applications of agentic AI. While revenue surged, SoundHound grappled with margin pressure due to low-margin acquired contracts and call center operations, which it plans to optimize over the next 18\u201324 months.R&D, Sales & Marketing, and General and Administrative costs increased significantly (up 66%, 117%, and 79% year over year, respectively), driven largely by acquisitions and investments in talent, infrastructure, and go-to-market capabilities. While these investments are necessary to build scale, they weigh on near-term profitability.Automotive volumes were impacted by geopolitical uncertainty, though higher AI-driven ASPs offered some relief. Additionally, a customer transition also delayed $2 million in expected first-quarter revenue to later in 2025. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SOUN\u2019s 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at 16 cents per share. Nonetheless, the estimated figure reflects an improvement from the year-ago loss of $1.04 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research SOUN shares are currently overvalued, as suggested by its Value Score of F. In terms of its forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, SOUN is trading at 25.66, higher than the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry\u2019s 19.63. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research SoundHound\u2019s impressive 21% rally following its first-quarter results underscores investor optimism in its long-term AI growth story, particularly within voice-enabled enterprise solutions. The company is scaling rapidly, as evidenced by 151% revenue growth and significant traction across core verticals, including restaurants, automotive, and smart devices. Strategic partnerships with tech giants like NVIDIA and Tencent, combined with recent acquisitions, are expanding SoundHound\u2019s ecosystem and revenue streams.However, margin compression, elevated operating costs, and continued EBITDA losses highlight the trade-off between growth and near-term profitability. Despite a robust 2025 revenue outlook of up to $177 million, valuation remains stretched, with SOUN trading at a rich forward P/S multiple. Given the mixed picture\u2014high growth potential tempered by operational challenges and a premium valuation\u2014the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) is appropriate. Investors may consider holding SOUN to participate in its AI-driven upside while waiting for clearer profitability signals before committing further capital.

Equity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory. Some investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at NVIDIA, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For NVIDIA, the 200-day moving average sits at $125.33, according toBenzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $133.04. For more on charts and trend lines,see a description here. Traders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.

The agreement, set to run through 2027 with an option to extend to 2030, allocates 20% of the chips roughly 100,000 units. to UAE-based AI firm G42.

Under the deal's terms, G42 must match each UAE facility with a similar data center in the U.S., promoting domestic infrastructure alongside overseas deployments.

        "content": "Cisco(CSCO) is scheduled to report results of its fiscal third quarter after the market closes on May 14 with a conference call scheduled for 4:30 pm ET. What to watch for: Quickly and easily unpack a company's performancewith TipRanks' new KPI Datafor smart investment decisions Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks straight to you inboxwith TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter GUIDANCE:Along with its last report, Cisco guided for Q3 adjusted earnings per share of 90c-92c on revenue of $13.9B-$14.1B. At the time, analysts were expecting the company to report Q3 EPS of 90c on revenue of $13.88B, but those figures have since risen to 92c and $14.06B. BUYBACK/DIVIDEND:Cisco also announced with itts last report that the company had declared a quarterly dividend of 41c per common share, a 1c increase or up 3% over the previous quarter\u2019s dividend, to be paid on April 23, 2025, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 3, 2025. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval. Cisco\u2019s board of directors has also approved a $15B increase to the authorization of thestock repurchaseprogram. There is no fixed termination date for the repurchase program. The remaining authorized fixed amount for stock repurchases including the additional authorization is approximately $17B. TARGET CUTS:Multiple analysts have cut their price targets on Cisco in the weeks leading up to the company\u2019s Q3 report. In early April, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Cisco to $60 from $72 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. Following its Q1 2025 on-calendar infrastructure checks, the firm is broadly reducing its estimates and price targets throughout the space given underlying macro-pressures that is seeing sales cycles extend. Piper is lowering its new-business and expansionary assumptions across the group, but FX headwinds have largely reversed. That same week, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall reduced the firm\u2019s price target on Cisco to $65 from $68 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. Tariffs add more uncertainty into the networking spending market, where demand intentions were \u201cstrong, but weakening,\u201d the analyst tells investors. The breadth of the tariffs announced on April 2 \u201cleave little room to hide,\u201d challenging margins, demand or both, the analyst added in a note on the telecom and networking equipment group. Citi also lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Cisco to $68 from $73 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The firm expects a rally in the North America communications equipment group on theTrumpadministration reciprocal tariff exemptions on PCs, smartphones, and 20 other products announced over the weekend. That said, Citi lowered its data center capex and PC models to reflect \u201cmacro induced \u201cweak demand. The firm prefersartificial intelligenceserver exposed stocks to enterprise, saying many enterprises maintain a fixed IT budget and will be reluctant to raise capex in response to price increases. The analyst expects the consumer segment to get \u201chit the worse\u201d oninflationand lower demand. Meanwhile, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Cisco to $70 from $73 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm updated hardware and networking models to reflect its best view of the second order impact of the current macro uncertainty stemming from tariffs. JPMorgan now embeds a broader macro slowdown and associated demand moderation across most customer verticals into its estimates. The analyst expects a macro slowdown to lead to lower demand from consumers, as well as enterprises and telecom customers. Additionally, Rosenblatt analyst Mike Genovese lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Cisco to $63 from $80 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The firm believes the March quarter results will be \u201cgenerally solid\u201d for the optical sector. However, none of the companies are immune to the negative impact to gross margins from higher tariffs, or from a meaningful macro slowdown, related to higher prices and general business environment uncertainty, likely to hit in the second half of 2025, the analyst tells investors in a research note. As such, Rosenblatt cut price targets in its coverage by an average of 19%. MELIUS:In late March, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes reiterated a Buy rating and $79 price target on shares of Cisco, highlighting three reasons to like the stock, whose \u201cstory may creep up on you quickly in CY25.\u201d The firm cites a series of recent deals with Nvidia(NVDA) that it argues give Cisco \u201ca shot to be on the right side ofAIin the enterprise,\u201d as well as a major campus switch refresh in the second half of calendar 2025 that it says \u201cshould bode well for a pickup in networking orders.\u201d In addition, the security strategy is \u201cfinally taking hold,\u201d which the firm thinks likely helps the multiple. \u201cIn short, Cisco is attractively priced and could be in the early innings of rerating,\u201d the analyst told investors. AI/MIDDLE EAST:This week, Cisco announced a series of strategic initiatives across all phases of the AI revolution in the United States and in the Middle East region. These new initiatives place Cisco at the center of the AI revolution in the Gulf, providing world class and trusted technology together with other Cisco partners, the company said. The announcements this morning follow the visit last week by CEO Chuck Robbins to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain, and the visit today by Jeetu Patel, EVP and Chief Product Officer, to Saudi Arabia, where he is participating in President Trump\u2019s state visit to the region. Cisco said it will collaborate with the AI Infrastructure Partnership, which is led by BlackRock(BLK), Global Infrastructure Partners, MGX, Microsoft(MSFT), Nvidia, and xAI. AIP will initially seek to unlock $30B in capital from investors, asset owners, and corporations. Cisco\u2019s addition as a technology partner to AIP, further strengthens the AIP platform as it seeks to invest in secure, efficient and scalable infrastructure to support AI workloads. Cisco also has announced to join a groundbreaking initiative with HUMAIN, Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI enterprise to help build the world\u2019s most open, scalable, resilient and cost-efficient AI infrastructure. Additionally, Cisco will extend strategic partnership with G42 to further advance AI innovation and infrastructure development in the UAE. The collaboration focuses on Cisco\u2019s comprehensive secure AI portfolio and AI-native solutions and services and G42\u2019s deep regional roots, AI infrastructure expertise, and expanding global footprint including a potential joint Go-To-Market initiative. Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Interior and Cisco signed a letter of intent to collaborate on Qatar\u2019s digital transformation, AI, infrastructure development and cybersecurity.

The investor cited the chip maker's stepped-up competition as the reason for his decision. A frequent guest on CNBC, Weiss is the Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner of Short Hills Capital Partners. Competing Chips Are Reaching the Market The AI chips that the giant cloud-infrastructure companies \"have been working on for years\" are now entering the market, Weiss reported. These firms are launching their own AI chips in order to reduce their dependency on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), the investor asserted. Given the large cloud-infrastructure players' large amounts of cash, \"they're not going to be held hostage to \"NVDA's high prices \"forever,\" Weiss stated. More Information About NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Analysts on average expect the company's earnings per share to climb to $4.39 this year, up from $2.99 in 2024. In the last month, the shares have risen\u00a0 32%, but they have lost 1.5% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "header": "Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.AMD is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition toNVIDIA CorporationNVDA by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Humain, the query arises on AMD\u2019s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let\u2019s analyze. Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn\u2019t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it\u2019s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According toBank of America CorporationBAC analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD\u2019s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA\u2019s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can\u2019t afford NVIDIA\u2019s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That\u2019s whyMicrosoft CorporationMSFT is using AMD\u2019s MI300X chips, andOracle CorporationORCL has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD\u2019s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA\u2019s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA\u2019s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA\u2019s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Whereas, brokers have increased AMD\u2019s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research While AMD may not surpass NVIDIA\u2019s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management\u2019s optimism about the company\u2019s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Of that, 100,000 chips would go to G42, an Abu Dhabi-based firm backed by sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. The rest would be split between American companies like Microsoft (MSFT,Financials) and Oracle (ORCL,Financials), which are also exploring Gulf data center expansions. The deal, still in draft form, would run through 2027 and could extend to 2030. It includes a condition that for every data center G42 builds in the UAE, it must build one in the U.S. The Biden-era cap on chip exports limited the UAE's compute access, but President Donald Trump's administration plans to reverse those restrictions. On his Gulf tour this week, Trump also announced $600 billion in Saudi investment commitments, including large orders from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD,Financials), and Qualcomm (QCOM,Financials).

The chips in question may include Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin GPUs, both more powerful than the Hopper line. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "Shares of Fiserv (FI) tumbled Thursday afterCFORobert Hau said the company expects volume growth of its Clover point-of-sale system this quarter to remain roughly in line with its first-quarter results. The stock dropped over 16% in recent trading, making it the leading decliner on theS&P 500. Fiserv shares have fallen more than 27% since the company reported last month that first-quarter Clover volume grew 8% year-over-year, compared to 14% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Clover growth is expected to be \u201cgenerally similar\u201d this quarter, Hau told attendees of a JPMorgan event Thursday, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. The CFO noted that some prior Clover volume growth was due to Fiserv\u2019s existing clients converting to the Clover gateway platform last year, which isn\u2019t repeatable. \"So we had a gateway that was non-Clover for clients that we converted over to the Clover Gateway... that doesn't repeat this year,\" said Hau. This gatewayheadwindis expected to increase this quarter, Hau added.

        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ismakingmoves. Recently, the chipmaker announced a fresh $6 billion stock buyback, pushing its total repurchase firepower to $10 billion. The goal? Shrink share count, boost EPS, and restore investor confidence. AMD's latest $10 billion AI collaboration with Humain is a bold swing, but questions linger on how quickly that bet can pay off. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMD. CEO Lisa Su says the repurchase signals strong belief in AMD's strategic direction and long-term cash flow. But Q1 free cash flow was down over 33%to $727 millionand cash on hand now trails current liabilities. That doesn't leave a huge margin for error. Add to that fierce competition from Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI dominance and a wave of custom chipmakers, and AMD's runway feels tight. Still, reducing the share count could help shore up EPSespecially if future earnings stabilize or rebound. The bigger picture? The long-term chart shows AMD's EPS without non-recurring items steadily trending up. Despite stock price swings, earnings performance has been resilient. If buybacks kick in and AI execution improves, the stock could catch up to the fundamentals. But make no mistakethis is now a show-me story. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "Welcome to Episode #444 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast. Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life. This week, Tracey went solo to make a case for buying NVIDIA right now. A year ago, Tracey did an episode of the Market Edge Podcast that also made the case for buying NVIDIA. Over the last year, NVIDIA was up 43.9% while the S&P 500 was up 12.9%. However, as of the recording of this podcast, on May 13, 2025, NVIDIA was down 6% year-to-date. NVIDIA hasn\u2019t yet reported earnings, but others in the AI Revolution trade have done so. Those earnings reports have been solid. Is the panic over the AI Revolution trade being \u201cover\u201d misplaced? 2 AI Revolution Stocks for Your Short List 1. Vertiv Holdings Co. (VRT) Vertiv is involved in the services side of the AI Revolution, including the racks in the data centers. It is a partner of NVIDIA and has already reported earnings. Vertiv beat on earnings again. Shares of Vertiv have rallied big off the Liberation Day lows. It is up 53% in the last month. Earnings for Vertiv are also expected to rise 24.6% in 2025. As a result, Vertiv now has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.8. Should Vertiv be on your Short List? 2. Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. (STRL) Sterling Infrastructure provides large scale infrastructure services in E-Infrastructure, which includes data centers, Transportation and Building Solutions. Last quarter, Sterling said that data centers was \u201cvery active\u201d and now represents 65% of E-Infrastructure backlog. Shares of Sterling have rebounded off the Liberation Day lows, adding 38.4% in the last month. Earnings are expected to rise 38.5% in 2025. Sterling trades with an attractive P/E of 22. Should investors be looking to infrastructure companies like Sterling as an AI Revolution play? Should You Buy NVIDIA in 2025? 1. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) NVIDIA makes the chips that are powering AI. Earnings soared the prior 2 years as AI took off. NVIDIA\u2019s earnings jumped 293.9% in fiscal 2024 and 130% in fiscal 2025. Defying the naysayers, who believed AI would burn out quickly, this year, earnings are expected to rise another 43.5% and then gain 26.8% in fiscal 2027. Meanwhile, shares of NVIDIA have lagged the last 6 months, falling 7.8% in that time. But earnings estimates have been revised higher which has led to a much cheaper stock on a forward P/E basis. Is NVIDIA Cheap in 2025? Last year, when making the case for NVIDIA on this podcast, NVIDIA was trading with a forward P/E of 39 and a PEG ratio of 1.3. On the day this podcast was recorded, on May 13, 2025, NVIDIA was trading with a forward P/E of 29 and a PEG ratio of 1.2. NVIDIA is trading near the company\u2019s recent lows on a P/E basis. Is there a case for buying NVIDIA right now? What Else Should You Know About NVIDIA? Tune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.

        "content": "Coinbase Global (COIN) shares tumbled Thursday after the company said it had been the victim of a cyberattack, and as a report emerged the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the platform. Shares fell over 7% to close just above $244 Thursday, after surging earlier in the week on news thatCoinbase will join the S&P 500next Monday. With Thursday's losses, the stock slipped back into negative territory for 2025. The online cryptocurrency exchange said in an SEC filing that it received \"an email communication from an unknown threat actor claiming to have obtained information about certain Coinbase customer accounts, as well as internal Coinbase documentation\" on May 11. The company added that the \"threat actor\" likely got the information by paying non-U.S. based contractors and other employees \"to collect information from internal Coinbase systems to which they had access.\" \"The communication demanded money in exchange for not publicly disclosing the information,\" the filing said. Coinbase said it has not paid the demand and is working with law enforcement. Its investigation is still ongoing, but Coinbase said it expects the incident to cost between roughly $180 million and $400 million \"relating to remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements.\" Coinbase said no passwords or customer funds were ever accessed. However, it said names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, last four digits of Social Security numbers, masked bank account numbers, and Coinbase account data like \"balance snapshots and transaction history\" may have been compromised. Separately Thursday,The New York Timesreported the SEC is investigating Coinbase's use of a metric tracking \"verified users\" in regulatory filings, which said Coinbase had over 100 million verified users ahead of its 2021 initial public offering.The company stopped using the metric in filings in 2023, opting to instead focus on \"monthly transacting users\" as a more representative number of the platform's users. \u201cThis is a hold-over investigation from the prior administration about a metric we stopped reporting two and a half years ago, which was fully disclosed to the public,\" Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said in a statement toInvestopedia. \"While we strongly believe this investigation should not continue, we remain committed to working with the SEC to bring this matter to a close,\" Grewal said. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment on the report. This article has been updated since it was first published with the latest share price values, and information about a report regarding an SEC investigation into Coinbase's metrics.",

Wall Street regained its risk appetite this week thanks to easing U.S.-China tensions, soft inflation data, and a slew of deal announcements out of President Trump's Middle East tour. TheCboe Volatility Index (VIX), sometimes called \u201cthe fear index,\u201d dropped below 20 for the first time since March on Monday and has held steady since then. AI stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have been among the biggest beneficiaries of investors' subsiding fear. But with stock gains comes speculation that the rally won't last, and thus more interest from active traders, like hedge funds, looking for opportunities to profit from pullbacks. Among the stocks least loved by active traders is SoundHound AI (SOUN). Traders have sold short about $1.2 billion of the Nvidia-backed company\u2019s stock, compared with just $340 million of long positions, according to data from market research firm S3 Partners. Another notable name: Super Micro Computer (SMCI), shares of which have soared about 40% this week amid a blistering AI rally. The total value of Supermicro short positions exceeds long positions by more than half a billion dollars. In dollar terms, SoundHound and Supermicro skew short more than most stocks. But relative to their size, these two stocks have more bullish support than some other hot stocks. Traders have sold short five times as much Rigetti Computing (RGTI) stock as they\u2019ve bought long. Two more quantum computing stocks\u2014IonQ (IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS)\u2014have short-to-long ratios exceeding 2:1.

After opening the session in negative territory, the S&P 500 recovered to close with a daily gain of 0.4%. The Dow added 0.7%, while underperformance in the tech sector pressured the Nasdaq, which fell 0.2%. Medical equipment maker Steris (STE)topped net income forecastswith its fiscal fourth-quarter results, and its shares surged 8.5% to lead the S&P 500 higher. The provider of infection prevention products reported year-over-year revenue growth across its health care, applied sterilization technology (AST), and life sciences segments. Although shares of Walmart (WMT) came under pressure after its chief financial officer said elevated tariffscould weigh on profitability, shares of fellow retailer Dollar General (DG) gained 6.0% on Thursday. Analysts have previously suggested that stores like Dollar General and competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR)could have some flexibility to raise pricesas competitors across the retail space also begin charging more for products. Shares of hospital operator HCA Healthcare (HCA) advanced 4.9% after Bank of America boosted its price target on the stock and affirmed its \"buy\" rating. Analysts pointed to strong demand for HCA's health care services as well as the company's effective cost management. The chief financial officer (CFO) of Fiserv (FI) said the growth trajectory of its point-of-sale platform, Clover, isunlikely to improve this quarter. According to the executive, prior growth for Clover came from the company's existing clients migrating to the platform, which can't be repeated. Fiserv shares dropped 16.2% on Thursday, the most of any S&P 500 stock. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)\u00a0shares tumbled 10.9% following a report indicating that the Department of Justice isinvestigating the insurer for potential Medicare fraud. The move lower exacerbates heavy losses for the stock earlier this week after the firm announced the departure of its CEO and suspended its 2025 forecasts. Shares of First Solar (FSLR) slipped 3.5%, reversing a portion of the strong gains posted earlier this week after a Congressional proposal suggested a relatively bright outlook for solar providers compared with expectations.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. You always have, you know, interesting line of sight, of course, Steve, into retail traders. So, maybe just start there, broadly, Steve. You know, the customers on Robin Hood, what interests them right now, what excites them, Steve, what have they been buying? Oh, thanks for having me, and good to see you. It's definitely been an interesting market, uh, in the last month. But, um, we just released our metrics, our monthly metrics, so gives us a good view of, um, what customers have been doing. Um, and what we saw was, uh, one of the best months we've ever had in deposits, so clearly our customers saw opportunities, you know, to, to buy the dips. Um, and our, our equity volumes were something we haven't seen in four years. And our option volumes were also close to all-time highs. And our margin balances have pretty much been holding steady. So, um, you know, it's an opportune time for our customers to step in, um, and some of the names, the most popular names that they like to trade, the Amazons, the Apples, uh, Nvidias that, you know, there was a perception we're going to be really harmed by, um, what was being proposed from a tariff standpoint. Um, they saw, you know, some depreciations of 50%, and, you know, now they're back to previous levels. So, um, from a customer standpoint, I would say, uh, customers really kind of stepped in, and I would say, you know, we've been reading a lot about retail in general, which, you know, has, has sort of stepped in and, uh, been opportunistic. Um, so it's good to see. So you mentioned Amazon, Apple, Nvidia. So we have a big tech theme going on, Steve. What, what do you make of that? Did that surprise you in any way? No, I don't think it surprised me because they're some of the most popular names, you know, um, from a retail, uh, trading standpoint. I think the other thing that we saw, and this tends to happen broadly in, in, with retail traders is, when you get extreme moves, and we had some pretty extreme moves, I mean, we're talking about a VIX over 60, and, uh, a depreciation in the overall market of 20 plus percent in a very short period of time, uh, you do see customers, uh, move away from some individual names and move into broad-based ETFs. And, uh, the thesis is, um, they have less conviction about one single name, um, rebounding, and more conviction about the market in general rebounding. So, um, as soon as, as soon as we get less, a less volatile marketplace, and a rally back, you tend to see customers gravitate back into the individual names, and we've seen that.",
