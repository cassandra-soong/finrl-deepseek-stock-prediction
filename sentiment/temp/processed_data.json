        "content": "IonQ (IONQ) shares surged Thursday tolead quantum computing stocks higheras the company\u2019s CEO said it aims to become the Nvidia (NVDA) of quantum computing. CEO Niccolo de Masi toldBarron\u2019sin an interview that the company is \u201cin the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) are in the business of classical GPUs,\u201d asserting that he believes IonQ will be the Nvidia player. The remarks come after D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) earlier this week announced thelaunch of its next gen quantum computer, known as Advantage2, underpinning bullish sentiment across Wall Street\u2019s latest hottest sector. IonQ shares jumped 37% to $45.79 on Thursday, pushing the stock into positive territory for 2025. The shares have more than doubled from their early-April lows and have risen more than five fold over the last year, as investors bet thatquantum computingwill revolutionize areas like drug discovery,cybersecurity, and finance. Below, we take a closer look at IonQ\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After finding support at the closely watched200-day moving average, IonQ shares trended higher within arising wedgebefore staging avolume-backed breakout above the pattern in Thursday\u2019s trading session.

        "header": "Analysis-Amid 'Jensanity', Nvidia signals plans to keep AI crown",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney and Wen-Yee Lee TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang flew out of Taipei on Friday after a week revelling in the adoration of Taiwan's tech industry, and delivering a subtle but crucial message from the U.S. AI chip king on how it plans to keep its crown. While 'Jensanity' swirled around Huang at the Computex trade fair, Nvidia itself was at a crossroads. Having grown to become the world's most valuable chip company, investors fear a drop in spending onartificial intelligenceinfrastructure as well as damage to sales from U.S. trade friction. U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports have seen Nvidia lose market share in China as it withdraws chips and designs inferior alternatives compliant with evolving U.S. policy. Now, cloud computing giants such asMicrosoftand Alphabet's Google have signalled cuts to AI spending. And while the 62-year old CEO has in the past month announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars in regions such as the Gulf, analysts said such deals are likely to become scarce. \"Is every country going to announce a $10 billion or $50 billion data centre like the Saudis? Of course not,\" said Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg. \"They're sort of running out of obvious deals.\" When asked by Reuters how Nvidia planned to deal with AI spending slowdown, Huang said, \"AI infrastructure is being built out (everywhere) - that's one of the reasons I'm travelling around the world... AI infrastructure is going to be a part of society.\" NEW GROWTH At Computex, Huang revealed a means of growth that does not rely on mega sovereign infrastructure arrangements: new technology that expands Nvidia's grip on the AI market. The tech's centrepiece is called NVLink Fusion. It allows companies to plug custom chips into Nvidia's AI infrastructure, thereby becoming a platform upon which others can build. \"Instead of having to build the entire rack of equipment themselves, (companies) could innovate or differentiate on the custom (chip) itself,\" said Nick Kucharewski, vice president at Marvell Technology. The bet is that drawing companies to build hardware that utilises Nvidia's Fusion platform will drive demand for the underlying AI network and data centre parts that Nvidia sells. Nvidia has also begun to reach into the enterprise market. This week, it launched a line of servers that Huang described as an \"enterprise AI supercomputer\". Huang's pitch was that the servers open up a multi-billion dollar market because customers can use them for \"everything\", such as graphics, virtual machines and AI applications. The enterprise market is large but difficult to break into, said Seaport Research's Goldberg. Deals tend to be small - compared with a sovereign data centre - and more expensive and time-consuming to win. \"My sense is we're sort of bumping up against the limits of expanding the customer base,\" Goldberg said. TAIWAN ECOSYSTEM Nvidia works with some of Taiwan's biggest names in tech, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes many of its chips. However, the underlying infrastructure for AI would not be possible without the hundreds of Taiwanese companies big and small supplying components and manufacturing know-how needed to construct Nvidia's complex AI systems. \"The purpose of Computex was to bring together the ecosystem and the supply chain,\" said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at consultancy More Than Moore. Such a network is necessary to support the deals announced in the Gulf and that are likely coming elsewhere in the world in the coming months, Cutress said. Taiwanese industry has embraced Huang, who is perceived as a local-born hero hailing from Taiwan's historic capital of Tainan before migrating to the U.S. when he was nine years old. By the time he flew out on Friday, Huang had appeared on stage or at banquets with nearly every prominent Taiwanese tech executive, including Chairman Young Liu of AI server builder Foxconn who called him the \"leader of Team Taiwan\". MediaTek CEO Rick Tsai gave Huang chunks of guava in a plastic bag from the Nvidia leader's favoured fruit stall in Taipei during one of the chip designer's events. Solomon Technology, a provider of industrial automation and AI-based inspection solutions which uses Nvidia's software tools, said working with Nvidia is a win-win situation. Shares of Solomon have surged 241% since Huang mentioned the firm at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in March last year. \"The collaboration with Nvidia has given us greater visibility. We weren't very well-known before, but with Nvidia's support, many more people know us now,\" said Solomon Chairman Johnny Chen. (Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "With the stock market having calmed down and settled into a more normal trading pattern, now might be a good time to start investing in some great tech stocks. $1,000 is a great starting point to begin accumulating shares, and then if the market dips again, you have room to add more. Let's look at two terrific tech stocks to start buying now with a $1,000 investment. Image source: Getty Images. Chip giantNvidia(NVDA-2.25%)remains the best-positioned company to continue to benefit from theartificial intelligence (AI)buildout. Itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, providing the computing power needed to run AI workloads. The company's dominance in the GPU space can be seen in its over 80% market share. While the company's chips are top-notch, what has really set it apart and created a wide moat is its CUDA software platform. It created the free software platform to allow developers to be able to program its chips for purposes beyond their original intent of helping speed up graphics rendering in video games. Since then, it has built a collection of libraries and tools on top of its platform called CUDA X that helps bolster the performance of its chips for AI tasks. The company sees demand for its GPUs coming from multiple areas. The biggest is in thecloud computingspace, where the big three providers are aggressively building out data centers to keep up with the demand stemming from customers looking to customize AI models and run AI workloads on their systems. In addition, companies that build foundation AI models, such asMeta Platformsand xAI, have also been building out data centers, while OpenAI is part of the Stargate Project, a consortium that plans to spend $500 billion on data centers over the next few years. Enterprises have also started to increase their on-premise data center spending as they look to deploy hybrid cloud models for AI. At the same time, countries have also begun to invest in AI infrastructure. For example, on his trip to the Middle East, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a big AI infrastructure investment from Saudi Arabia. When looking at risks, the biggest one Nvidia faces is if AI infrastructure spending begins to slow. The company does not have a recurring revenue stream like a software company, so it relies on increased demand for its chips. Right now, though, it appears that AI infrastructure spending is poised to continue to ramp up. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, with aforward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)of under 31 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.6price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), with numbers below 1 considered undervalued. One tech stock that has been tossed in the bargain bin this year isAlphabet(GOOGL-0.74%)(GOOG-0.73%). While the company has continued to post strong revenue and earnings growth, investors remain concerned that AI is going to disrupt its main search business. Alphabet's Google search engine has a dominant position in search, with an approximate 90% global market share. However, there is no doubt that AI chatbots are gaining momentum and beginning to become more mainstream. While they have their flaws, there are many things that these AI chatbots do well, and they can answer more complex questions better than a search. But Google Search doesn't make much money from searches involving things like helping students with a biology paper or helping someone design a workout routine. Historically, it has only served ads on about 20% of its queries and makes money from searches with a commercial intent. As such, when the company recently introduced its new AI Mode for search, it came with clear ways to improve upon inquiries with commercial intent. This included agentic capabilities, where it can search across platforms to present you with the best ticket prices from sites like Ticketmaster and StubHub for a concert or sporting event. Need to research a summer camp for your child with specific criteria and distance from your home? It can do that. It also has a Shop by AI Mode that can find items based on your description, let you try on outfits virtually using an uploaded photo of yourself, and even track prices for items you are interested in. In addition to its often-overlooked strength in AI, Alphabet has some big advantages that tend to get ignored. Between its Android smartphone operating system, Chrome browser, and revenue-sharing deal withAppleto be the exclusive search engine for Safari, the company is the default search engine on most devices connected to the internet. It also has the world's largest advertising network, and its reach in local markets around the globe is difficult to replicate. As such, in what is ultimately a two-sided marketplace of consumers and advertisers, Google has been able to entrench itself on both sides. So, despite the inroads that Perplexity and ChatGPT have made, Google still has a solid moat. With a forward P/E of only 17.5 times, Alphabet stock is cheap. Investors also get a lot more than Alphabet's search business. They get its fast-growing cloud computing business, a rapidly expanding robotaxi business inWaymo, and the most watched video streaming service in the world with YouTube.",

        "content": "Yesterday,Navitas Semiconductor(NVTS-12.08%)stock exploded by more than 160% following news thatNvidia(NVDA-2.25%)has selected the company to help develop 800-volt, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power systems for its next-generationartificial intelligence(AI) data centers. With roughly 12.8% of Navitas shares sold short before the announcement and a market cap still hovering around $886 million as of this writing, this explosive move has triggered a mix of excitement and skepticism among investors. Image source: Getty Images. The question now is whether this rally has staying power -- or whether investors have already missed the moment. The answer may depend on understanding not just what happened, but why it matters for the future of AI infrastructure. Read on to find out more. The Nvidia partnership isn't window dressing -- it positions Navitas at the center of one of the most ambitious infrastructure overhauls in AI history. The collaboration involves replacing today's antiquated 54V power architecture with a revolutionary 800V HVDC standard capable of supporting IT racks of 1 megawatt or more. To put this in perspective, current data center infrastructure maxes out at a few hundred kilowatts per rack. Nvidia's next-generation \"Kyber\" rack-scale systems, powering graphics processing units (GPUs) like the upcoming Rubin Ultra, will demand unprecedented power density. The shift to 800V HVDC isn't just an upgrade -- it's a complete rethinking of how power flows through the digital backbone of AI. Why does this matter? Because power delivery is quickly becoming the bottleneck for AI expansion. As compute requirements explode, traditional power systems are hitting physical limits. Nvidia's projections suggest the shift to HVDC could improve data center power efficiency by 5%, cut copper use by 45%, and reduce maintenance costs by up to 70%. For hyperscale operators managing thousands of racks, these improvements translate to millions in operational savings. Navitas' gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors are central to delivering this transformation. Its GaNFast and GeneSiC technologies enable the high-frequency switching and thermal efficiency required for 800V systems -- capabilities that traditional silicon simply cannot match. What sets Navitas apart isn't just its technology -- it's the company's integrated approach. While competitors focus on individual components, Navitas has developed complete power system solutions. Their recent demonstration of an 8.5 kW AI data center power supply achieving 98% efficiency isn't just impressive -- it's production-ready. The company's GaNSafe power ICs (integrated circuits) include integrated protection features that traditional discrete solutions lack. Meanwhile, its GeneSiC silicon carbide devices utilize proprietary \"trench-assisted planar\" technology that delivers superior performance and reliability. The magnitude of the stock's move wasn't driven by fundamentals alone. As of the latest report, 12.8% of Navitas' float was sold short -- an unusually high level for a small-cap tech name. This situation created a powder keg waiting for a catalyst. Short squeezescan be violent and brief, and the rally from under $2 to nearly $5 in a single session reflects a technical unwind as much as a fundamental repricing. The high short interest suggests many investors had written off Navitas as another struggling semiconductor company. The Nvidia announcement forced a rapid reassessment. But here's what makes this different from typical short squeezes: The underlying catalyst has substance. This isn't a meme stock rally driven by social media hype -- it's a fundamental shift in how one of the world's most important technology companies approaches power infrastructure. Despite the excitement, Navitas' financials still demand caution. The company generated approximately $83 million in revenue in 2024 but posted a net loss of nearly the same amount. The bottom line is that the path to consistent profitability remains unclear without significant design wins and volume ramps. That's not surprising given the large short interest, and this Nvidia news doesn't immediately change the situation. Navitas remains a speculative stock, but the asymmetric upside has sharpened considerably. The Nvidia partnership validates both the technology and market opportunity while providing a credible path to scale revenue. A market cap under $900 million leaves substantial room for revaluation if the collaboration leads to broader industry adoption. What's the investing takeaway? Navitas has suddenly moved from obscurity to center stage in the next phase of the AI infrastructure build. The stock may give back some of its recent gains as momentum fades, but the company's opportunity has suddenly expanded in a way that's impossible to ignore. That said, this small-cap tech stock should still be viewed as a high-risk, high-reward option on the larger AI infrastructure build.",

        "content": "There aren't too many investors with better track records than Stanley Druckenmiller. Over a 30-year period, which included 12 years working as a portfolio manager for George Soros at the Quant Fund, Druckenmiller generated average annual returns of 30%, according to Hedge Fund Alpha. Today, Druckenmiller is still investing his own money through his family's fund, Duquesne Capital Management. In the first quarter of the year, Druckenmiller slashed his position in the electric-car makerTesla(TSLA-1.61%)by about 50% and more than quadrupled his stake in another artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 2,800% since its initial public offering (IPO). Filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission show that Duquesne lowered its stake in Tesla by about 50% and now holds about 18.8 million shares. Following President Donald Trump's election victory in November, shares of Tesla rocketed higher as investors believed the stock would benefit from CEO Elon Musk's close relationship to the president. However, in the first quarter of the year, most of those gains evaporated, as Tesla's core electric-vehicle (EV) business struggled and investors worried about how Musk's foray into politics might impact the brand.  TSLAdata byYCharts. Druckenmiller is certainly a believer in AI but also remains disciplined on valuation, as his past investments have showed. The legendary investor didn't hesitate to sell the AI chip giantNvidiawhen he thought that valuation rose to unsustainable levels. Tesla always traded at a nosebleed valuation due to Musk's larger-than-life brand and the company's promising future initiatives. These include full-self-driving (FSD) technology and the Optimus robots that will supposedly be able to complete regular household chores. All eyes are now on an upcoming FSD demonstration in Austin some time in June that could renew investor excitement for the stock. But with the core EV business still struggling, particularly in China, where competitors likeBYDhavetaken significant market share, Tesla needs to keep future initiatives on track to maintain its high valuation. Image source: Getty Images. In the first quarter, Duquesne also more than quadrupled its position inTaiwan Semiconductor(TSM-2.00%), purchasing an additional 491 million of shares in the quarter. Nvidia is viewed as one of the main pick-and-shovel AI plays, given that its chips help power AI applications. But Taiwan Semiconductor goes a layer deeper and is currently one of the most advanced manufacturers of graphics processing units (GPUs). The company manufactures Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang previously called Taiwan Semiconductor the premier chip manufacturer in the world by an \"incredible margin.\" He said if something were to happen to the company or Nvidia wasn't able to partner with them, the company could still produce chips but it would be much more difficult. \"Maybe the process technology is not as great. Maybe we won't be able to get the same level of outperformance or cost, but we will be able to provide the supply,\" Huang said. In the first quarter of the year, Taiwan Semiconductor reported solid earnings ahead of Wall Street consensus estimates, while guiding for revenue growth in the mid-20s percentile in 2025, driven by AI-associated revenue, which the company expects to double this year. This seemed to suggest that tariffs haven't impacted the company yet and that management is still seeing strongAI demand. Taiwan Semiconductor certainly faces challenges from export restrictions set by the Trump administration on Nvidia and other U.S. chip players that do business in China, but the stock trades at a fairly reasonable forward earnings multiple of 18, which isn't expensive as far as the AI space goes.",

        "content": "If you're eager to earn passive income,real estate investment trusts(REITs) offer a straightforward way to access consistent returns from real estate without the hassle of managing properties. And they\u2019ve outperformed traditional stock market indexes over long-term investing periods. REITs are the ideal asset class for someone who wants toinvest in real estatewithout directly buying and managing properties, said San Francisco-based financial advisorSaid Israilov, co-founder of Israilov Financial. Israilov recently recommended REITs to a client who reached out eagerly wanting to invest in real estate after seeing his neighbor generating rental income from several properties. However, the client also had a demanding day job and two young kids, so he didn't have enough time to properly manage a rental property and its tenants. REITs were a good alternative for him. Through REITs, Israilov said, you can gainexposure to real estatethat\u2019s already professionally managed without necessarily making a large initial investment, in addition to dividend yields of about 4%. That compares to a S&P 500 dividend yield of 1.27%.Plus, REITs can provide sector diversification through office, residential, and commercial real estate offerings. When looking at average annualized returns from January 1990 to October 2020, REITs outperformed U.S. stocks more than 56% of the time, according to an analysis by Nareit, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.REITs were even more likely to outperform U.S. stocks over long-term investment periods of 19 years or more. Investors can gain exposure to REITs by buyingpublicly traded REITsorETFsthat own REITs. You buy these on an exchange orbrokeragejust as you would other stocks and ETFs. Financial advisorChad Olivier, CEO of the Louisiana-based Olivier Group, said buying individual REITs such as Prologis and Equity Residential can offer higher yields than REIT ETFs, but the lack of diversification comes with more risk. \u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to buying an individual stock, so you need to make sure you\u2019re on top of the research,\u201d Olivier said. \u201cEach REIT is different, and oftentimes, one might be more concentrated in certain sectors.\u201d On the other hand, REIT ETFs\u2014such as the Vanguard Real Estate ETF and the Schwab US REIT ETF\u2014can provide you with broader exposure because they own many different individual REITs. The funds pool each REIT\u2019s profit and distribute that to investors. As a result, REIT ETFs generally providelower risk to investorsand more moderate yields in the 2.5% to 4% range. For example, the MSCI US REIT Index had a dividend yield of 4.10% as of April 2025.Just be aware that most REIT dividends are taxed as ordinary income, unlikequalified dividendsfrom stocks that are taxed at the lower capital gains rate. In the long term, REITs tend to beat out the S&P 500 on total return. As of April 2025, the FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index, which tracks the performance of the U.S. REIT industry, had outperformed the S&P 500 over one-year, 25-year, and 50-year periods. The FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index had a 25-year annual total return of 9.53%, compared to 7.52% for the S&P 500. If you\u2019re looking to earn passive income through other means,Cynthia Meyer, the founder of Real Life Planning, suggestsreal estate crowdfundingor \u201chouse hacking,\u201d which involves buying a multifamily property, living in one property, and renting out the others\u2014or using a property you already own to generate extra income. Think: Airbnb or taking in roommates. \u201cIt's passive income on your tax return, but it still takes a lot of work,\u201d Meyer said. REITs make real estate investing accessible to everyday investors while offering steady dividends with long-term growth potential. Forrisk-averse investors, REIT ETFs are a solid choice, but good research can help you land higher-yield options. No single method suits everyone, so explore multiple options to diversify your passive income.",

        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) -An earnings report from semiconductor giant and artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia takes center stage for Wall Street in the coming week, as stocks hit a speed bump of worries over federal deficits driving up Treasury yields. U.S. equities have pulled back this week after a torrid rally, as investors turned their attention to tax and spending legislation poised to swell the U.S. government's $36 trillion in debt. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields rose amid the fiscal worries, with the 30-year yield topping 5% and hitting its highest level since late 2023. Focus will shift to Wednesday's quarterly results from Nvidia, one of the world's largest companies by market value whose stock is a major influence on benchmark equity indexes. \"All eyes are going to be on Nvidia's report,\" said Chuck Carlson, CEO of Horizon Investment Services. \"The whole AI theme has been a major driver of the market and Nvidia is at the epicenter of that theme.\" Nvidia will be the last of the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap tech and growth companies to report results for this period. Their stocks have been mixed in 2025 after leading the market higher as a group in the last two years. Nvidia shares are down 1% this year after soaring over 1,000% from late 2022 through the end of 2024 as its AI chip business spurred massive increases in revenue and profits. Nvidia's first-quarter earnings likely jumped about 45% on revenue of $43.2 billion, analysts estimated in an LSEG poll. After big tech companies earlier in the quarter signaled robust AI-related spending, Nvidia can deliver a strong message about AI and how companies' spending plans are faring, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. \"Nvidia can reinvigorate the enthusiasm for that theme.\" Nvidia, popular among smaller retail shareholders, is an investor sentiment indicator, said Wasif Latif, chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners. \"Given its sheer size and attention that it is commanding, there are going to be a lot of people looking for what happens with the stock,\" Latif said. U.S.-China relations could also be in focus with Nvidia's report. The company said last month it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China. Trade developments have whipsawed the stock market this year, especially after U.S. President Donald Trump's April 2 announcement of sweeping tariffs on imports globally set off extreme asset price volatility. Since then, Trump's easing of tariffs, especially a U.S.-China truce, has helped equities rebound. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended on Thursday down less than 1% for 2025, and down about 5% from its February record high. Investors shifted attention this week to the fallout from Trump's fiscal plans, especially after Moody's downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating due to concerns about the nation's growing debt pile. The U.S. House of Representatives, controlled by Trump's Republican party, on Thursday narrowly passed a tax and spending bill that would enact much of his agenda while adding an estimated $3.8 trillion to the debt over the next decade. The bill is heading to the U.S. Senate for its review. Long-dated government bond yields have been rising globally amid a selloff. In the U.S., benchmark 10-year Treasury yields this week hit their highest since February. Bond prices move opposite to yields. Higher yields can diminish the appeal of stocks as they represent higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers, while making fixed income assets relatively more attractive. \"The biggest concern from an investment standpoint is that higher rates represent more competition for equities,\" said Horizon's Carlson. \"If rates continue to move higher, that is going to put increasing amounts of pressure on where investors are putting their money.\" (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Richard Chang)",

A frequent guest on CNBC, Terranova is a\u00a0senior managing director of Virtus Investment Partners. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be benefiting from \"very strong, consistent demand,\" Terranova said, noting that Abu Dhabi intends to purchase 18,000 chips from the tech giant. Huang's confidence indicates that Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will not have trouble meeting the demand for its chips, Terrranova suggested. The owners of NVDA stock should be pleased by the CEO's self-assurance, added the investor. In the last month, the shares have climbed 28%, while they have lost 5% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "content": "Kley Parkhurst; Senior Vice President and Assistant Secretary; ePlus inc Mark Marron; President, Chief Executive Officer, Director; ePlus inc Elaine Marion; Chief Financial Officer; ePlus inc Gregory Burns; Analyst; Sidoti & Company Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the ePlus fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings results conference call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kley Parkhurst, Senior Vice President. Sir, you may begin. Kley Parkhurst Thank you for joining us today. On the call is Mark Marron, CEO and President; Elaine Marion, CFO; and Erica Stoecker, General Counsel. I want to take a moment to remind you that the statements we make this afternoon that are not historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements and are based on management's current plans, estimates and projections.Actual and anticipated future results may vary materially due to certain risks and uncertainties detailed in the earnings release we issued this afternoon and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other documents we may file with the SEC.Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of which the statement is made, and the company undertakes no responsibility to update any of these forward-looking statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, we will be using certain non-GAAP measures during the call, and we have included a GAAP financial reconciliation in our earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Information section of our website at www.eplus.com.I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark? Mark Marron Thank you, Kley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 earnings call. Our financial results continue to reflect the ongoing industry-wide shift towards ratable and subscription-based revenue models, which impacts how we recognize product revenue. In fiscal year 2025, we delivered higher gross profitability and margin expansion on lower net sales and gross billings. In our fourth quarter, operating metrics were strong with double-digit increases in gross profit, operating income, adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share.We also saw continued improvement in our gross margin, which increased 270 basis points since fiscal year 2024. During the quarter, we believe sales were slightly impacted by business uncertainty surrounding the tariffs and government spending. With our strong focus on services-led solutions, continuing to build out our security and AI capabilities that are in high demand by our customers and holding the line on expenses, we believe we are well positioned for future growth. Q4 net sales declined 10.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by a reduction in product sales due in part to economic uncertainty as well as a tough compared to the prior year when Q4 last year benefited from supply chain easing of networking product orders.Despite an increased gross to net adjustment caused by the industry-wide shift towards ratable and subscription-based revenue models, we saw strength in several areas. Gross profit rose by nearly 12% and gross margin expanded 580 basis points year-over-year to 29.3% in the fourth quarter due to a more profitable business mix between product and services and a higher proportion of netted down revenue. Gross profit increased and margin expanded in the full year for the same reasons. Our services revenue continued its rapid growth, increasing 33% in the quarter and 37% for the year.This is a key component of our trusted adviser status to our customers, which deepens the relationship and results in long-term customer loyalty. Our managed services continue to grow nicely, up 16.6% for the quarter and 24.6% in the year, which provides predictable long-term revenue and profitability. Let me take a moment to discuss our long-term strategy, which is centered on delivering solutions across 4 key growth focus areas: AI, cloud, security and networking, of which we expect to drive related consultative, professional and managed services growth.We are making strategic investments in the most promising opportunities, both organic and inorganic to expand our capabilities and meet evolving customer needs. AI adoption continues to be a significant potential business driver, and we are particularly well positioned to capitalize on its transformative growth across our expanding suite of products. Throughout the past year, we have discussed the positive reception from our customers of our AI Ignite workshops and Envisioning sessions.These are designed to share the latest AI trends and insights and demonstrate how this revolutionary technology can empower our customers' businesses. We combine these AI Ignite offerings with our AI Experience Center and our Generative AI Accelerator solution that helps customers navigate and rapidly test use cases in a secure private instance. We also believe ePlus is the only NVIDIA partner in North America that has achieved both the NVIDIA DGX ready SuperPOD specialization and DGX ready Managed Service Provider specializations. This achievement demonstrates our engineering expertise for enterprise-grade AI infrastructure deployments and capabilities to provide end-to-end life cycle services from initial design through implementation and management of AI workloads.And finally, as the capabilities and benefits of AI become more clear, we have stepped up our AI investments to meet our internal business needs as well. We have seen how AI can support our customers better, automate some internal processes and provide real-time information for our sales teams to leverage and provide value to their customers. Security remains a standout for ePlus. On a trailing 12-month basis, it now represents 22% of gross billings, underscoring our success in aligning with enterprise priorities around digital risk mitigation and will only be more relevant as AI becomes more prevalent in the market.In conclusion, we have a very strong balance sheet, which gives us the opportunity to make strategic investments, both organically and through acquisitions. We exited the year with a record cash position of approximately $389 million. This financial flexibility provides a solid foundation as we navigate macroeconomic uncertainty and supports our growth initiatives. As always, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation and driving long-term shareholder value.I will now turn the call over to Elaine to discuss our financial results in more detail. Elaine Marion Thank you, Mark, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will provide additional details about our financial performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and review our full fiscal year results, which ended March 31, 2025. Consolidated net sales in the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter were $498.1 million, down from $554.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. And our consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $43.8 million, up from $36.8 million in the prior year, which exceeded our expectations as we captured increased gross profit from the sales of product.Technology business net sales declined 10.4% year-over-year to $487.2 million, reflecting lower product sales, which continue to be impacted by the industry-wide shift towards ratable and subscription-based services, resulting in more netted down revenues. Product sales also faced a tough year-over-year comparison as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 benefited from elevated deliveries of networking products. Partially offsetting the decline in product sales with strong demand for our services offerings, which we have strategically emphasized and grown.ePlus' services-led approach is evident in our results as our service revenues increased 33% year-over-year. Professional services revenues were up 48% as the segment continues to benefit from the Bailiwick acquisition, while revenues for our managed services rose 17%, led by sustained growth in enhanced maintenance support, or EMS, and cloud-managed services. Managed services bookings remain strong, underscoring our confidence in the segment.Technology business gross billings declined 5.4% in the quarter due to softer demand from enterprise customers as well as a challenging comparable in the prior period. Telecom, Media & Entertainment and SLED were our 2 largest customer end markets, accounting for 23% and 17% of technology business net sales on a trailing 12-month basis. Technology, health care and financial services accounted for 15%, 14% and 9%, respectively, with the remaining 22% from other end markets. In our financing segment, net sales rose 4.9% to $10.9 million, primarily due to higher transaction gains and portfolio earnings.Fourth quarter 2025 consolidated gross profit increased 11.8% to $145.8 million, representing a gross margin of 29.3%, comparing favorably to gross profit of $130.3 million and gross margin of 23.5% in the prior year fourth quarter. The increase in gross margin was led by our technology business, which saw product margin expand from 19.3% to 26.6%, reflecting more profitable mix and a larger proportion of sales of product that were recognized on a net basis as well as additional gross profit from our services business.In our services business, professional services gross margin was 35.9% versus 50% in the comparable prior year period. Bailiwick, which we acquired in August of 2024, has lower professional services gross margin due to a higher concentration of third-party costs in the business model, contributing to the year-over-year decline. Managed services gross margin of 29.1% declined modestly from the 30.5% reported in the prior year due to an expanded mix of services provided. Fourth quarter 2025 operating expenses of $111 million increased 9.6% from the prior year quarter as we recognized costs related to increased headcount from the Bailiwick acquisition. Our headcount at the end of the quarter increased to 2,199 from 1,900 a year ago, reflecting an increase of 299 employees, of which 272 were customer-facing.Sequentially, our headcount decreased from 2,291 at December 31, 2024. Benefiting from our strong margin performance, consolidated operating income and earnings before taxes rose 19.6% and 14.9%, respectively. Other income totaled $1.1 million, driven by interest income of $2 million, partially offset by foreign exchange losses. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 29.7%, slightly higher than the 29.5% reported in the prior year quarter. Consolidated net earnings were up 14.6% to $25.2 million or $0.95 per diluted share versus net income of $22 million or $0.82 per diluted share a year ago.Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.11, representing an increase of 19.4% year-over-year and weighted average diluted share count decreased slightly from the prior year's fourth quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased 19.1% to $43.8 million, with 97% of the increase from our technology business.Moving on to our results for the full year of fiscal 2025. Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year were $2.07 billion, down from $2.23 billion in fiscal 2024. The decline was driven by a 13.7% decline in product sales, partially offset by 37.1% growth in services and strong performance in the financing segment. Technology business gross billings of $3.3 billion were down slightly year-over-year. Fiscal 2025 consolidated gross profit rose 3.3% to $569.1 million, led by growth in both the technology business and financing segment.Gross margin expanded 270 basis points to 27.5%, reflecting favorable product mix, a larger proportion of netted down revenues and additional services revenue in the technology business.Operating income was $141.4 million versus $158.3 million a year ago. The decline was primarily a function of lower product sales and increased operating expenses, which rose 9% year-over-year due to the Bailiwick and PEAK acquisitions as well as continued investments in technology and customer-facing headcount. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 27.5% below the 28.1% reported in the prior year due to lower state taxes. Consolidated net earnings were $108 million or $4.05 per diluted share in fiscal 2025, this compares to $115.8 million or $4.33 per diluted share in the year ago period.Non-GAAP diluted EPS amounted to $4.67 per share, down from $4.92. Fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.4% to $178.2 million. Our balance sheet remains solid with assets over $1.8 billion, highlighted by our cash position of $389.4 million at the end of fiscal 2025, well above $253 million at the end of fiscal 2024, reflecting strong operating cash flows of $302.1 million compared to $248.4 million in fiscal 2024. As of March 31, 2025, our inventories were $120.4 million. While inventories were higher sequentially, they were below $139.7 million reported at the end of fiscal 2024.Stockholders' equity was $977.6 million compared to $901.8 million at the end of fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2025, we repurchased more than 557,000 shares under our repurchase program, leaving 26.5 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2025. Our cash conversion cycle was 29 days compared to 46 days a year ago as inventory days outstanding declined from 23 days in fiscal 2024 to 14 days at the end of March 2025, highlighting a more normalized supply chain. Our strategy of focusing on high-growth areas and anticipating our customers' needs continues to position us well for the future. We remain focused on strategic capital allocation with an eye toward organic and inorganic investments in an effort to add geographies and increase our service offerings.With that, I will turn the call back over to Mark. Mark? Mark Marron Thank you, Elaine. Our core business is solid, and our team is executing well. This is reflected in our financial results with solid gross profit growth and margin expansion. We continue to review our portfolio of products and services, identifying new sources of growth in our core markets. Our strong balance sheet provides us the opportunity to invest organically and make acquisitions when the right opportunity comes along.As always, we will continue to take a balanced and disciplined approach to building our company and evolving our business model for the future.Moving next to a comment about guidance. We are cautiously optimistic as we head into fiscal year 2026 but want to be prudent when considering the entire year and the trends we are experiencing with regard to ratable and netted down revenue. Today, we are initiating fiscal year 2026 guidance for net sales growth of low single digits, while we expect gross profit and adjusted EBITDA to grow at mid-single digits over the prior fiscal year. This guidance assumes some level of impact from economic uncertainty but does not factor in recessionary conditions or other unexpected developments.To sum up, our strategic pivot towards services, subscriptions and high-growth technology areas is gaining traction. We believe these foundations, combined with our financial strength and customer-first approach position us well to support our customers' evolving and growing business needs. We believe we are well positioned for the opportunities ahead and remain committed to delivering value for all of our shareholders.Operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator (Operator Instructions) Greg Burns, Sidoti & Company. Gregory Burns Where do you -- where is the demand environment currently? Like did you see any improvement throughout the quarter? Are you still seeing soft demand on the product side of the business. Can you just maybe give us an update on what you saw during the quarter, how it evolved and kind of where we are currently? Mark Marron Greg, a couple of different things we're seeing in the market. We are seeing pickup in the data center, cloud and security space. That's not surprising. When you think about some of the AI initiatives that are going on, some of the things that folks have to think through is security in terms of governance and risk, data readiness and things along those lines.They also make a lot of times the simple choices to move to the cloud. So we saw some nice pick up there. We did not see a pickup in networking year-over-year. So networking was down pretty big still for us.And then if I look at net sales just overall generically, what we kind of saw was, as we looked over the last couple of years, a few things. For this quarter, it was a big gross to net that affected our net sales. We had a tough compare, no excuses. We were up 12% last year. So that was another -- and we had a few customers that are digesting some of the supply chain, specifically in the networking space.We think they'll start to come back into play in the coming quarters. So overall, data center cloud, security, nice pickup. Networking still needs to improve. Gregory Burns Okay. And then when you look at the AI opportunity, most of the investment has been going into like the hyperscaler data center environment. Where does like enterprise AI adoption, enterprise investment stand? And do you think that -- I guess, maybe in your guidance for next year, does that contemplate any kind of acceleration in maybe AI demand? Mark Marron Yes. Not yet, Greg. Maybe towards the end of the year, beginning of next year. So you're right, most of the spend with NVIDIA and the bigger players is going towards the hyperscalers. What we're seeing is customers are taking advantage of some of our workshops and envisioning sessions.We've got a hosted proof of concept, basically a private GenAI chatbot that we -- that gives customers the ability to kind of test and play around with their data to come up with use cases. So we think a lot of that will be on the services side that will drive for us, which is a good thing. It's our most profitable business. And then we think the infrastructure stuff will start to pick up. We've made investments with the training of our sales teams. We also just got the NVIDIA SuperPOD specialization, which is their high-end computing. So over time, we think that infrastructure spend will pick up, but it will take a little bit of time. Operator And there are no further questions. So I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Marron for closing remarks. Mark Marron Okay. Thanks, Abby. Thank you, everyone, for attending our Q4 and full year earnings call. I hope everybody gets to enjoy the long Memorial Day holiday, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our next earnings call. Take care and be safe. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

        "header": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Nvidia Next?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-2.25%)was unstoppable last year, when it added over $2 trillion to its market cap. Along the way, it split its stock for the second time this decade and the sixth time overall since going public in 1999. Companies often outperform the market after splitting their stock, and that was the case for Nvidia after its most recent stock split. But the tech giant has slowed down quite a bit in 2025. It has been volatile, like many major tech stocks, and its share price is down 3% year-to-date at the time of this writing. Is another stock split in the cards to boost Nvidia's share price? Here's what to expect and a look at Nvidia's recent results. Image source: Getty Images. I won't keep you in suspense -- I highly doubt Nvidia will split its stock in 2025 or 2026. The primary benefit of astock splitis that it lowers a company's share price, which makes investing in that company seem more affordable. \"Seem\" is the operative word here. The number of outstanding shares increases, but the company's overall value doesn't. If a company is trading for $1,000 or $2,000, some investors will likely think twice about investing because of how much it costs to buy in. It's not a huge barrier, now that many brokers let investors buyfractional shares, but a lower share price can help increase the appeal of a stock. After Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split on June 10, 2024, it went from a share price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. For new investors, especially those on a budget, it's much easier to buy a stock for $120 than for $1,200. Nvidia's value has gone up by 10.2% since its stock split. Since the share price has only changed a relatively small amount, another stock split doesn't serve much of a purpose. Nvidiahas been one of the biggest winners as tech companies have increased spending on artificial intelligence (AI). Revenue has grown for eight consecutive quarters, and by a sizable amount -- it reported $130.5 billion in revenue for its 2025 fiscal year, up 114% year over year. About 88% of that revenue comes from data centers and the graphics processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia develops for them. While data centers now make up a dominant portion of Nvidia's business, it's also a leader in gaming GPUs and reported $11.4 billion in revenue from that segment during its 2025 fiscal year. In addition to its revenue growth, Nvidia is a highly profitable company.Gross marginfor the 2025 fiscal year was an impressive 75%, and its net income of $72.9 billion was a 145% year-over-year increase. Nvidia has its next quarterly earnings report on May 28, and it has consistently surpassed analysts' expectations in recent years. There may not be a stock split on the horizon, but a positive earnings report is even better. Most importantly, Nvidia is doing well financially because of the strength of its business. Demand for GPUs has skyrocketed since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia is the leading GPU company, including gaming GPUs and the most advanced AI GPUs. The global GPU market is projected to keep growing, with Arizton Advisory & Intelligence estimating it will go from $70 billion in 2024 to $237.5 billion in 2030. Given Nvidia's dominant position, it will almost certainly take a large slice of the market's growth. The biggest challenge Nvidia is currently facing is the effect of tariffs and a potential U.S.-China trade war. It already reported that it will take a special charge of about $5.5 billion this quarter for exporting H20 processors to China and other locations. And Nvidia manufactures its products in countries that were hit with high tariff rates, although they've been lowered for the time being. In response to the tariff announcement, Nvidia announced plans to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. within the next four years. These plants will produce Nvidia AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. Tariffs could be a headwind in the short term, but Nvidia should be able to navigate them, and there's always the possibility of a trade deal. Stock splits may get investor attention, but a company's financial results and long-term growth prospects are what really matter. Those are two areas where Nvidia shines. I wouldn't expect a repeat of its 2024 results, but I think it's one of the bettertech stocksand will continue to outperform the market.",

        "content": "Warren Buffett once proclaimed that Vanguard founderJack Bogle\u201chas probably done more for the American investor than any man in the country.\u201d Buffett\u2019s praise appeared to affirm his longstanding appreciation for theindex-tracking fundsthat Bogle helped bring to the masses. But there was actually more to it than that. Just days earlier, one of Bogle\u2019s funds had helped Buffett win a $1 million wager. AtBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s 2006 annual meeting, Buffett boldly claimed that an index fund tracking the U.S. stock market would deliver greater returns over one decade than any hedge fundmanager. He invited attendees who disagreed to bet against him. Buffett\u2019s love for index funds was well known by this time. The Oracle of Omaha had been advising investors for decades to choose cheappassive index fundsthat blindly buy the whole market instead of expensive actively managed funds seeking to do better. Once fund managers get paid and trading costs are included, he said, the returns will inevitably be lower than the broader market. Hedge fund manager Tom Sedies disagreed and with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners LLC, a money management firm he founded that runsfunds of hedge funds, accepted Buffett\u2019s challenge. The bet was set at $1 million, with the proceeds going to charity. Initially, it looked like Sedies and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would succeed as the2008 financial crisisdecimated stock markets. However, by the end of the decade, Buffett won the wager by a huge margin. His pick, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, which tracks the S&P 500, returned 126%, while the quintet of funds-of-hedge-funds chosen by Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 delivered an average return of 36%. In the end, not even one of them beat Buffett\u2019s index fund. Just days after Seides officially conceded defeat, Buffett was due to give his trademark speech atBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. Bogle had been invited to the event for the first time, but wasn\u2019t aware why. It wasn\u2019t until later that the reason became clear. After the usual jokes and presentation of Berkshire\u2019s financial results, Buffett, in front of thousands of people, started giving his much less famous special guest his due, claiming he \u201chas probably done more for the American investor than any man in the country.\"\"I estimate that Jack, at a minimum, has saved and left . . . tens and tens and tens of billions into their pockets, and those numbers are going to be hundreds and hundreds of billions over time,\u201d said Buffett, before thanking Bogle on behalf of American investors. Warren Buffett spent much of his career criticizing thefees collected by active fund managers, urging most investors to buy passive index funds. After he won his $1 million bet, he publicly gave thegodfather of index investingand founder of the fund that helped him win the wager his due. In front of thousands of people, Buffett told Bogle he was an under-appreciated American hero who had made investing much more lucrative for the average person. Bogle not only had a hand in Buffett winning $1 million. He helped him vividly illustrate that most fees collected by active managers weren't justifiable.",

        "header": "Where Will AMD Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-2.02%)is an important player in the global semiconductor industry as its chips power multiple applications such as personal computers (PCs), gaming consoles, data center servers, and communications and aerospace equipment, among others. But its performance on the stock market has left a lot to be desired in the past three years. AMD stock has been weighed down by factors such as sharp declines in PC shipments in 2022 and 2023, the poor performance of its embedded business on account of tepid demand from telecom customers, and soft demand from the gaming segment. Additionally, the company's inability to corner a substantial chunk of the boomingartificial intelligence (AI)chip market, whereNvidiahas established itself as the clear leader, has also dented investor confidence. All this explains why AMD stock has clocked just 17% gains in the past three years. That's way lower than the 68% jump in theNasdaq Compositeindex over the same period. However, AMD's financial performance has been picking up pace in recent quarters thanks to a solid jump in sales of its PC and data center chips. But will the company be able to sustain this momentum over the next three years and deliver market-beating returns? AMD has witnessed a nice jump in its revenue and earnings in the past couple of years. This is evident from the chart below.  AMD Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts This impressive turnaround can be attributed to the gradual recovery in the PC market, as well as AMD's entry into the data center graphics processing unit (GPU) space. Sales of PCs were up by 3.9% last year, and they are expected to head higher on the back of the growth in AI-enabled PCs and the end of support for Windows 10 PCs in October. Market research firm TechNavio is expecting the PC market to clock a compound annual growth rate of almost 8% through 2028. This suggests that the next three years for the PC market are likely to be much better than the last three. This is great news for AMD investors as the company's client central processing unit (CPU) business has been in fine form in recent quarters. For example, AMD's client segment revenue shot up an impressive 68% year over year in Q1 to $2.3 billion, accounting for 31% of its top line. This was extremely impressive when you consider that global PC shipments rose 6.7% year over year in Q1. AMD has been consistently gaining share in the client CPU market in recent quarters, and this explains why its growth significantly exceeded the broader market. According to Mercury Research, AMD's revenue share of the client CPU market shot up by more than 10 percentage points in the first quarter of 2025 to 26.5%. This was better than the increase of 3.5 percentage points in its unit share to 24.1%, suggesting that AMD is enjoying stronger pricing power for its processors. AMD's market share numbers also tell us that the company still has a lot of room for growth. Management remarked on the latest earnings conference call that it is confident it can grow \"client processor revenue well ahead of the market in 2025,\" a trend that's likely to continue over the next three years consideringthe problems faced byIntel, AMD's rival in this market. So, a combination of higher market share along with the PC market's recovery over the next three years could turn out to be a big growth driver for AMD. Meanwhile, AI data centers are boosting demand for AMD's server CPUs and GPUs. This explains why the company's data center revenue shot up an impressive 57% year over year in the first quarter of 2025 to $3.7 billion. Just like the client CPU market, AMD has been eating into Intel's share of data center CPUs. Its revenue share of the server CPU market increased by more than 6 percentage points in Q1 to 39.4%. Image source: Getty Images. There is a good chance that AMD will be able to corner a bigger share of the server CPU market in the future as major cloud computing providers and enterprise customers have been turning to this platform to power their data centers. Moreover, AMD believes that the launch of its next-generation server CPU platform, which will start shipping in the second half of the year, should continue to power the growth of this segment. This won't be surprising as the company estimates that the fifth-generation processors based on the Turin architecture could deliver 17% better performance while tackling enterprise and cloud workloads as compared to the previous generation processors. Even better, they are expected to deliver a 37% improvement in performance during AI and high-performance computing tasks. On the other hand, AMD's customer base for its data center GPUs is also expanding. The company is not only adding new customers for its Instinct series of data center graphics cards, but is also bringing new ones on board. The company's momentum in the data center GPU market could get better once it launches its upgraded MI350 accelerators this year. AMD is promising big performance gains by \"increasing memory capacity and bandwidth 1.5x, adding support for new data types, and improving network efficiency to deliver 35x higher throughput and performance compared to MI300x.\" Not surprisingly, AMD says that the demand for its upcoming AI GPUs is solid, with the likes ofOraclealready set to deploy clusters powered by its new chips. Again, investors would do well to note that AMD doesn't need to become the biggest player in the AI GPU market. It could witness a significant jump in its data center GPU revenue over the next three yearseven if it plays second fiddle to Nvidia. AMD stock is currently trading at 28 times forward earnings, which is a discount to theNasdaq-100index's earnings multiple of 31.5. What's more, the stock has a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 0.58 based on its projected earnings growth over the next five years, according to Yahoo! Finance. A PEG ratio of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued when you take into account the growth it could deliver over the next five years. Not surprisingly, consensus estimates are projecting AMD's earnings to increase to $6.88 per share in 2027, which would be more than double its 2024 earnings of $3.31 per share. Assuming AMD trades at 27 times earnings after three years (in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple) and does hit the consensus earnings estimate, its stock price could jump to $188. That would be a 66% jump from current levels, suggesting that thistech stockcould deliver a much-improved performance over the next three years.",

        "content": "Investors are poised for a crucial update on Nvidia\u2019s earnings after the AI chip maker has been caught up in the fallout of Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy overhaul. The US technology giant will unveil its financial results for the first three months of 2025 on Wednesday. As the second most valuable listed company in the world, behind Microsoft, Nvidia is watched closely by global traders. Nvidia was among global technology firms to suffer sharp drops in their share price following Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariff announcements last month. However, they have rallied since and most of the losses suffered on Wall Street in the wake of the announcements have been regained. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that analysts will \u201cdoubtless\u201d look for comments from Nvidia\u2019s chief executive, Jensen Huang, on tariffs. He added that they will also be closely watching for an update on the impact of the US government tightening rules on chip exports to China, after the company warned over a 5.5 billion US dollar (\u00a34.1 billion) cost hit from the move. Nvidia said it has been informed by the US government that it needs a licence to export its H20 AI chip to China, including Hong Kong, for the \u201cindefinite future\u201d. Mr Huang recently blasted the country\u2019s wider export controls as a \u201cfailure\u201d, saying they had backfired against US companies by spurring on Chinese developers. Meanwhile, the boss has tried to soothe investor concerns about Chinese AI firm DeepSeek emerging earlier this year as a lower-cost rival to the US giant. \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs and trade policies are blotting out many other issues right now, but this one is yet to go away,\u201d Mr Mould said. \u201cThe (DeepSeek) product challenged the consensus view that AI required more \u2013 more chipsets, more computing and server power, and more energy \u2013 and AI-related stocks have yet to fully recover their poise.\u201d \u201cNvidia did offer fairly cautious guidance for the first quarter, which runs from February to April, but it has had the happy knack of beating estimates for the quarter,\u201d he added. Nvidia is expected to report sales of about 43 billion US dollars (\u00a331.9 billion) for the first quarter, about two-thirds higher than the 22.1 billion dollars (\u00a316.4 billion) generated this time last year.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) will report its fiscal first quarter results after the bell on Wednesday in the most-anticipated earnings announcement of the season. Nvidia\u2019s stock has fluctuated wildly since the start of the year as the company has dealt with setbacks ranging from the Trump administration\u2019s ban on shipments of its H20 chips bound for China to concerns related to expected semiconductor tariffs. But a last-minute reprieve from Washington\u2019s planned AI diffusion rule, which was put in place by the Biden administration to limit GPU sales to certain countries, and major investment announcements during Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East have pushed Nvidia\u2019s share price to just about flat year to date and up roughly 40% over the last 12 months as of Thursday. Nvidia\u2019s report follows the company\u2019s showing at the annual Computex Taipei tradeshow in Taiwan, where it showcased new technologies, such as its new cloud offering, which gives customers access to cloud-based versions of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs via third-party providers, including CoreWeave (CRWV) and Foxconn (2354.TW). For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year. Wall Street anticipates Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenue to top out at $39.2 billion, up from $22.5 billion, which works out to a 74% year over year increase. Gaming revenue, the company\u2019s second-largest segment, is set to hit $2.8 billion, up from $2.6 billion. Read more:How does Nvidia make money? Analysts anticipate Nvidia\u2019s China revenue to come in at $6.2 billion, up 150% from the $2.4 billion it sold in the region in Q1 last year. The US is expected to account for $21.6 billion of the company\u2019s sales. Nvidia, however, says it will have to write down $5.5 billion in charges related to the Trump administration\u2019s ban on sales of its H20 chip. The company announced the newsin an April regulatory filing. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to meet the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on AI chips destined for China. But DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Washington, and Wall Street, when it proved it could produce powerful AI models using below top-of-the-line Nvidia chips. As a result, Trump imposed tighter restrictions on the company\u2019s chips, banning the sale of H20s in the country. According to Reuters, Nvidia is now working on a modified version of the H20 that meets the Trump administration\u2019s performance requirements. During a press conference at Computex, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came out swinging against the US\u2019s policies, saying that they\u2019ve been a failure and that they benefit China\u2019s own AI chipmakers,according to Bloomberg. Nvidia received relief from some export restrictions when the Trump administration axed the Biden administration\u2019s planned AI diffusion rules, which would have created a tiered system that determined which countries could purchase AI chips and which required special licenses or couldn\u2019t get them at all. The administration plans to introduce a new set of export requirements in the future. The move set up Nvidia\u2019s announcement that it will providehundreds of thousands of GPUs over the next five years to Humain, an artificial intelligence startup backed by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The news came during Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East, which also included theannouncement of a second Project Stargatethat will be built in the United Arab Emirates using Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell systems. \u201cFor investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deeppocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,\u201d Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in an investor note.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid onApple Podcasts,Spotify,YouTubeor wherever you find your favorite podcasts. In the continuing saga of humans vs. the AI revolution, fear is common for anyone fretting about its impact on their job or quality of life. \"Listen, this [AI] is just another transition, like before Excel, after Excel, or before or after you could use a search engine,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) chief investment officerMarco Argentitold Yahoo Finance Executive EditorBrian Sozzion a new episode of theOpening Bidpodcast (see the video above or listen below). \"It's more about what part of your job is like something that you really feel that you add unique value,\" he continued. \"It elevates your work rather than doing repetitive tasks.\" Argenti is fluent in the dance between human and machine. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he was involved in tech integration across several departments within Amazon's (AMZN) AWS cloud services division. \"I came in 2013, which was almost at the beginning of a mega cycle of cloud computing,\" he recalled. Argenti joined Goldman Sachs in 2019, just as AI was beginning its rise in everyday use. \"I would estimate that at this moment, close to two-thirds of the organization in one way or another is exposed to an AI tool,\" he said of the investment bank. AI adoption comes in waves, starting with using it to make existing processes more efficient, followed by deeper integration into the organization, Argenti said. Another milestone is using AI agents to perform tasks such as analysis and data extraction in reports. \"The way you scale those agents is that [they] are outsourced to other agents,\" he said. \"The same way as you have managers.\"  Early on, fear of AI's negative impacts on the human workforce reigned supreme. In2023, critics cited lack of human insight, creativity, and privacy issues among their concerns. That same year, Goldman Sachs estimated AI could upend as many as 300 million jobs, and Resume Builder surveyed 750 business leaders about their attitudes toward AI.Of the companies using AI, 37% said the technology would replace some of their workers. In 2024, a separate poll found that 44% of employers would \"definitely or probably\" lay off workers due to AI. Meanwhile, the economy has had its AI-related ups and downs. Last summer, AI chip king Nvidia (NVDA) disrupted the \"Magnificent Seven\" and briefly becamethe highest-valuedcompany. Later, upstarts likeDeepSeekentered the arena, threatening incumbent large language models (LLM) by doing a similar job for cheaper. Yet, it isn't as simple as replacing humans with machines. Everything has a shelf life, and according to Argenti, AI agents aren't immune. \"Essentially, you shut them down or retrain them,\" he said of the risks of an AI workforce. \"You can actually put them back to the drawing board and retrain them.\" Argenti envisions a world where humans and machines coexist, with their best talents being put to use. \"You might have some job displacement at the beginning, but then those industries tend to create a lot of new jobs,\" he said. \"We have 12,000 developers within Goldman Sachs out of 45,000 people. If we didn't have computers, we wouldn't have those people, and so generally it rebalances itself.\" \"I think that will be the same for AI, except there is a certain velocity,\" he said.

The McLean, Va.-based firm projected fiscal 2026 adjustedearnings per share (EPS)between $6.20 and $6.55 on revenue of $12.0 billion to $12.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $6.92 and $12.82 billion, respectively. In Friday's earnings call, CEO Horacio Rozanski said the Trump administration's focus on cutting costs is impacting its contracts with civilian agencies, leading the company to \"restructure and reset\" its civil business, with cost reductions and layoffs \"to match anticipated demand.\" CFO Matt Calderone said the company expects to cut about 7% of its staff in the first quarter, \"heavily concentrated\" in its civil business, as the company expects its defense and intelligence segments to continue growing this year. As of March 31, Booz Allen had roughly 35,800 employees, putting the 7% layoff figure likely around 2,500 people. For the fourth quarter, the company reported adjusted EPS of $1.61 on revenue that increased 7% year-over-year to $2.97 billion.

        "content": "Developments around US trade relations and economic concerns continue to occupy much of investors' attention, but earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA), among others, will also be in the spotlight in the coming week. There will be a quieter start to the week with US markets closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. UK markets will also be closed on Monday for the late May bank holiday. After traders return from the long weekend, the major focus will be on Nvidia (NVDA), which is due to release first quarter earnings on the Wednesday, as the last of the Magnificent 7 tech behemoths to report this earnings season. Salesforce (CRM), which provides customer relationship management (CRM) software, is another key tech name reporting on Wednesday. Computer maker Dell (DELL) is then set to report on Thursday, on the back of it unveiling new AI servers powered by Nvidia (NVDA) chips this week. In the retail sector, investors will be looking at wholesale retailer Costco's (COST) latest results, to help gauge US consumer sentiment amid economic uncertainty. On the London market, investors will be hoping that B&Q-owner Kingfisher (KGF.L) has benefitted from the UK's rise in retail sales, thanks to warmer weather in April. Here's more on what to look out for: Expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia (NVDA) earnings, which was demonstrated in the market reaction to its full-year results in February. Shares fell after the release of the results, despite the chipmaker beating estimates on the top and bottom line. Revenue of $39.3bn (\u00a329.1bn) beat estimates of \u00a338.2bn and earnings per share of $0.89 were also ahead of forecasts of $0.84. In addition, the company said it expected to generate revenue of $43bn for the first quarter, better than the $42.3bn expected. However, Nvidia (NVDA) guided to gross profit margins of 70.6% to 71% in the first quarter, which would be down on the 73% it reported in the fourth quarter. Ahead of its latest earnings, Nvidia (NVDA) made a flurry of announcements around new technologies at the start of this week, with CEO Jensen Huang revealing more details at the Computex tech expo in Taipei, Taiwan. This included showcasing Nvidia's (NVDA) Isaac GR00T-Dreams, which the company described as a blueprint that helps generate large amounts of synthetic motion data that physical artificial intelligence (AI) developers can use to teach robots new behaviours. Read more:Five 'buy' rated European travel stocks In addition to its robotics capabilities, Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled its new NVLink Fusion offering, which allows customers to build custom servers using Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Grace CPU and a third-party AI chip paired with Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) various server infrastructure offerings. At the event on Wednesday, Huang also called on Jensen Huangcalled on the Trump administration to ease Biden-era curbson AI chip exports to China. Attention will now turn to Nvidia's (NVDA) first quarter results, which are due out on Wednesday, 28 May. AJ Bell's investment experts, Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth said that Nvidia (NVDA) \"has had the happy knack of beating estimates, which on this occasion will be benchmarked against the guidance given by chief executive Jensen Huang alongside the full-year results back in February. Just as important will be any steer or forecasts for the second quarter, which runs from May through to July.\" \"Note that Nvidia (NVDA) has already signalled it may take a $5.5 billion one-off charge against its first-quarter results, relating to US bans on shipment of silicon chips to China,\" they said. \"These costs relate to the H20 chipset and cover materials and penalties, although the company is likely to present this cost as extraordinary and strip it out of the published figures.\" In terms of guidance for the second quarter, they said that analyst consensus had a forecast of $45.4bn in sales and $1 for earnings per share. In addition to Nvidia's announcements, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet-owned Google (GOOG,GOOGL) have alsounveiled new tech featuresthis week, including developments around AI agents. AI agents, which has emerged as one of biggest trends in tech, are semi- or fully autonomous pieces of AI software that can perform certain tasks for users. Salesforce (CRM) is another player in this space, so investors will be keen to understand the take-up of its technology, when it reports first quarter earnings on Wednesday. Its platform Agentforce allows companies to build and customise AI agents to help automate certain functions for customer service. In its full-year results in February, Salesforce (CRM) guided to total revenue of $9.71bn to $9.76bn for the first quarter, which would represent 6% to 7% growth year-on-year. Diluted earnings per share are expected to come in at between $1.49 and $1.51 for the quarter. For the year, Salesforce (CRM) has guided to revenue of $40.5bn to $40.9bn, which would be up 7% to 9% on its 2025 fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for the 2026 fiscal year are expected to be in the range of $6.95 and $7.03. Read more:Stocks that are trending today Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said this latest set of results follow a year of \"modest revenue growth\". \"Having spent the past year or two rightsizing the business, costs are in a much better place, and both profits and cash flows are feeling the benefits,\" he said. \"While this was a necessary step, the focus now shifts back to driving top-line growth.\" Chiekrie said that revenue growth guidance for the first quarter was \"softer than markets were hoping for at the time.\" \"This reflects a tricky macroenvironment where businesses are still being selective of their software spending,\" he said. \"Missing this target range next week would likely weigh heavily on investor sentiment.\" \"Investors were excited to hear Salesforce\u2019s (CRM) AI platform, Agentforce, gained early momentum late last year with over 3,000 paid AI deals,\" Chiekrie added. \"But with around 150,000 customers, these deals aren\u2019t dial movers just yet. Some analysts think it\u2019s just a matter of time, and markets are keen to hear whether the positive momentum has continued into the new year.\" Computer maker Dell (DELL) also hosted its own tech event this past week, which came with it sharing details of its collaboration with Nvidia. On Monday, Dell unveilednew AI servers, powered by Nvidia's (NVDA) Blackwell Ultra chips. At the Dell Technologies (DELL) World 2025 event, the company's CEO Michael Dell and Nvidia's (NVDA) Huang talked about a range of new offerings as part of itsDell AI Factory ecosystem, which together with the chipmaker, is aimed at making AI accessible to business of all sizes. Dell (DELL) said he envisioned a future where AI becomes \"as essential as electricity\" and that it could unlock an estimated $15tn in global economic value by 2030. Read more:More interest rate cuts in doubt after surprise inflation surge In terms of company performance, Dell (DELL) reportedmixed fourth quarter resultsin February. Revenue of $23.93bn fell short of estimates of $24.65bn, but adjusted earnings per share of $2.68 beat analyst forecasts of $2.53. For the first quarter, Dell (DELL) also issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance, forecasting sales forecasting sales between $22.5bn and $23.5bn, slightly missing the Street's expectations of $23.55bn. Shares in Dell (DELL) declined following the release of the results and have since recovered but the stock is still trading nearly 3% in the red year-to-date. Earnings from major US retailers are being closely watched, to help understand consumer behaviour, as concerns about the economy persist amid uncertainty about US president Donald Trump's tariffs. Shares in Walmart (WMT) slid after it released a set ofmixed quarterly resultsearlier in May, beating earnings per share estimates but missing revenue expectations. In addition, the retailer alsosignalled price hikeswould be in store due to Trump's tariffs. Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said: \"We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible, but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.\" Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio He added on an earnings call that tariffs had already led to price increases in April and May. McMillon said the \"reset of costs\" will continue throughout the year, adding for an \"imported item, you pay the tariff at the time it comes through customs ... even if the tariff rate comes down later, the cost has been elevated.\" Investors will be looking at Costco's (COST) to see if the wholesale retailer offers any commentary on tariffs. Shares in Costco tumbled after the release of itssecond quarter earningsin March. The stock has since rebounded but is up just 11% year-to-date. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.02 were below Bloomberg consensus estimates of $4.11, though revenue of $63.72bn came in slightly ahead of expectations of $63.01bn. In its most recent sales figures, released earlier in May, the retailer reported net sales of $21.18bn for the month of April, which was up 7% on the same period last year. Data released on Friday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that retail sales were estimated to have risen by 1.2% last month, which was the sunniest April on record. \"With the unusually warm spring weather sending homeowners into a craze of refreshing homes and gardens, it bodes better, in the short term, for B&Q owner Kingfisher (KGF.L),\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"In April, DIY sales saw a significant increase, with consumer spending boosted for outdoor related products, in particular.\" \"Also, a surge in property completions due to the end of the stamp duty holiday is likely to have led to higher sales of products used in renovations,\" she added. Read more:UK 'bargain' stocks that have outperformed the market long-term However, she said that \"problem is that the expected uplift could just be a flash in the pan for Kingfisher (KGF.L), rather than the start of a more sustained increase in sales.\" Streeter pointed out that the last financial year had proved \"highly difficult\" for Kingfisher (KGF.L), with it posting a 35% drop in pre-tax profit to \u00a3307m ($414m). Sales were also slightly lower for the year, dipping 1.5% to \u00a312.8bn. \"Although there is more strength in its digital operations and trade business in the UK, other markets are problematic,\" she said. \"In France, consumer confidence has fallen to a three-month low, which won\u2019t help efforts to turn around its struggling Castorama chain.\" In its full-year results in March, Kingfisher (KGF.L) guided to adjusted pre-tax profit of \u00a3480m to \u00a3540m. \"With some fears about the economic outlook lifting, investors will be hoping Kingfisher (KGF.L) might be able to unveil an improved outlook for the rest of the year for the group, but the signs right now are not super-positive,\" said Streeter.

In its first-quarter results after the bell Thursday, Ross Stores reported earnings per share of $1.47 on revenue of $4.98 billion. Both metrics came in slightly above Visible Alpha consensus.

        "header": "Big Tech's spending drove Nvidia's rise",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) rise has been fueled by Big Tech\u2019s spending on its AI chips. Its fellow members of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of Big Tech stocks are also its biggest customers. Microsoft (MSFT) is the largest driver of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, followed by Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), according to Bloomberg estimates. Tesla (TSLA) is Nvidia\u2019s 15th largest customer. As of Nvidia\u2019s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter (the three months ending on Jan. 26 of this year), Bloomberg estimates that Microsoft spends roughly 47% of its capital expenditures directly on Nvidia\u2019s chips and accounts for nearly 19% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue on an annualized basis. Bloomberg compiles its data from publicly available documents, such as company financial reports and presentations and news stories, and adjusts its numbers on an annualized basis for comparison. Meanwhile, 25% of Meta's capital expenditures go to Nvidia and the company accounts for just over 9% of Nvidia\u2019s annual revenue. And that\u2019s alldirectspending on Nvidia. Big Tech also props up Nvidia indirectly. For example, Microsoft spends big sums renting data center capacity from cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV), which spends billions of dollars on Nvidia\u2019s chips for those data centers. Microsoft accounted for 72% of CoreWeave\u2019s revenue in the company\u2019s most recent fiscal quarter. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are set to spend north of $330 billion, cumulatively, this year, fueled by their spending on AI investments. \u201cWe believe NVIDIA is reliant on a handful of large technology companies for about half their revenue,\u201d DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email. \u201cThat portion of revenue has gone up dramatically the last couple of years but appears to be moderating its growth.\u201d Just three years ago, Microsoft spent less than 1% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia chips and similarly accounted for less than 1% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue on an annualized basis, according to Bloomberg data based on Nvidia\u2019s 2022 fourth quarter earnings. \u201cThis spend may further slow down as these customers increasingly use the chips they developed in-house,\u201d Luria added. \u201cWhile NVIDIA chips have a very large advantage on AI pre-training, the cost performance of the custom chips is much more competitive.\u201d Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon have all developed their own custom AI chips tailored to their specific AI workloads, making those chips more efficient for each company\u2019s needs. On top of that, rival chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) are developing custom AI chips for their customers, whereas Nvidia\u2019s GPUs (graphics processing units) are for more general-purpose AI computing. There\u2019s also aconcern that Big Tech firms could moderate their spending on AI hardware, generally, as investors question how they can monetize the technology and generate a return on their investment. Nvidia is set to report its fiscal year 2026 first quarter results on May 28. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect spending on Nvidia's AI chips for data centers will continue to decelerate. Nvidia's data center revenue is expected to jump more than 74% to $39 billion in the first quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus data. By comparison, data revenue rose a whopping 427% in the first quarter of Nvidia's fiscal year 2025. For now, the largest tech companies areholding steadfast to their staggering spending plans. In late April, Microsoftreiterated its $80 billion spending plan to build out AI data centers, with more than half of that spending going toward the US. Meta, meanwhile, raised its capital expenditure outlook for 2025, forecasting spending will now fall between $64 billion and $72 billion, up from its prior range of $60 billion to $65 billion.

Revenue is expected to reach a record $43.3 billion, compared to $26 billion in the same quarter last year, reflecting the continuing demand for AI chips. However, the upcoming results will be clouded by a $5.5 billion write-off tied to the company's H20 chips, which were designed for China. U.S. export restrictions blocked sales, leaving a major gap in Nvidia's international sales footprint. CEO Jensen Huang is expected to address that gap during the earnings call, with particular attention on whether growth from regions like the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, might help offset the China shortfall. Investors will also look for updates on demand across global AI markets and any strategic shifts in customer base, including potential pivots away from Big Tech toward governments and sovereign buyers.

U.S. stocks lagged, with international equities surpassing them by nearly 10% due to a weakening dollar and a significant tariff shock after the quarter's close.

Polen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2025 investor letter: \"NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) (not owned) is a large index constituent that saw share prices fall nearly 20% in the quarter. In recent years, NVIDIA has become the poster child of the generative AI infrastructure build out, given the critical role of its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in powering the technology. In late January, the stock sold off more than 17% in a single day on the back of the DeepSeek news out of China. The news prompted investors to question the need for growing GPU-related capex if large language models (LLMs) could achieve similar results more cost-effectively. While the stock partially recovered in the following weeks, concerns again intensified on news that NVIDIA\u2019s leading-edge Blackwell GPUs\u2014 banned from export to China\u2014were making their way to China via a Singapore-based shadow network. This revelation\u2014combined with mounting U.S.-China geopolitical tensions\u2014introduced new concerns that the U.S. could take an even more restrictive stance on exports to China. Consistent with our commentary over the past couple of years, we maintain a cautious stance around NVIDIA, given our inability to predict its long-term growth with a high degree of confidence.\" A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.

        "content": "Shares ofQuantum Computing(QUBT10.11%)soared higher this week. The company's stock jumped 7.3% as of 1:09 p.m. ET on Friday, but gained as much as 9.8% earlier in the week. The rise comes as theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.67%)lost 2.5% and theNasdaq-100lost 2.2%. A string of positive news from other quantum companies boosted the company's stock. This comes on the heels of the company's earnings release late last week that showed a profitable quarter. Given that the technology is in its infancy, investors have, by and large, been rewarding all quantum stocks when there is positive news from any one company. Early this week, fellow quantum computing companyD-Waveannounced its newest and most advanced computer, Advantage2, was available for use via the cloud. Then, on Thursday,IonQCEO Niccolo de Masi toldBarron'sthat he sees his company as the \"Nvidia\" of quantum, saying quantum companies are \"in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,\" adding, \"I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player.\" While it's not unusual for CEOs to make bold claims, the comparison was a compelling one, leading to a rally across the sector. Image source: Getty Images. While there are positive developments here, quantum computing is many years away from real viability in commercial applications. It will be a long time before any company can produce a solution that is robust, powerful, and stable enough to generate a return on investment. Quantum Computing's technology shows promise, but it is too early to tell which approach and companies will succeed. If you have a particularly high risk tolerance and the ability to wait a decade or more for your investment to pay off, Quantum Computing is a solid addition to your portfolio, but you should look tospread your quantum investment around to many companies in the space.",

        "content": "(Reuters) -Oracle will spend around $40 billion on Nvidia's higher-performance chips to power OpenAI's new U.S. data center, the Financial Times reported on Friday. The data center, situated in Abilene, Texas, is part of the U.S. Stargate Project, led by top AI firms in the country, to boost America's heft in the artificial intelligence industry amid heating global competition. The cloud service provider will purchase around 400,000 of Nvidia's most powerful GB200 chips and lease the computing power to OpenAI, the report said, citing several people familiar with the matter. OpenAI and Oracle did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while an Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment. The data center is expected to be fully operational by mid-next year, and Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years, the report said. JPMorgan has provided a bulk of the debt financing across two loans totaling $9.6 billion, while the site's owners, Crusoe and U.S. investment firm Blue Owl Capital, have invested around $5 billion in cash, the FT report added. The data center will help OpenAI reduce its dependence on its largest backer Microsoft as the ChatGPT maker's demand for power has outstripped the supply Microsoft can provide. For Oracle, the data center and Stargate present an opportunity for the firm to boost its cloud computing capabilities and catch up to market leaders Microsoft, Amazon and Google. OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia are also involved in a Stargate project in the Middle East, where a new massive AI data center will be constructed in the United Arab Emirates, likely using over a hundred thousand Nvidia chips.

The site in Abilene, Texas, has been billed as the first US Stargate project, the $500bn data centre scheme spearheaded by OpenAI and SoftBank, and will provide 1.2 gigawatts of power when it is completed next year, making it one of the largest in the world.  Oracle will purchase around 400,000 of Nvidia\u2019s GB200 chips \u2014 its latest \u201csuperchip\u201d for training and running AI systems \u2014 and lease the computing power to OpenAI, according to several people familiar with the matter.  The site\u2019s owners, Crusoe and US investment firm Blue Owl Capital, have raised $15bn in debt and equity to finance the Abilene project, which will encompass eight buildings and first broke ground in June last year.  The data centre is expected to be fully operational by mid-2026. Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years. Stargate, which incorporated earlier this year, has not invested in the site.  JPMorgan has provided the bulk of the debt financing across two loans totalling $9.6bn, according to people close to the matter, including a $7.1bn loan announced this week.

Amazon is building a data centre in northern Virginia that will be larger than 1GW.  The Abilene data centre is a crucial step in OpenAI\u2019s move to reduce its dependence on Microsoft. Previously, the $300bn-start up has exclusively relied on the US software giant for its computing power, and a large chunk of Microsoft\u2019s near-$14bn investment in OpenAI has come in the form of cloud computing credits.  OpenAI and Microsoft agreed to terminate their exclusivity agreement earlier this year after the start-up became frustrated that its demand for power far exceeded the US tech giant\u2019s supply. The two groups are negotiating to determine how long Microsoft will retain licensing rights to OpenAI\u2019s models.  Stargate will play a key role in providing OpenAI\u2019s future computing power. The high-profile venture, billed as a huge infrastructure project to boost the US AI industry, is raising $100bn to spend on data centre projects, with the figure rising to as much as $500bn over the next four years.  OpenAI and SoftBank have each committed $18bn to Stargate, which was unveiled in January by US President Donald Trump. Oracle and MGX, an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, committed a further $7bn each, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The four groups will hold equity stakes in the project, with SoftBank and OpenAI the majority owners, according to a second person with knowledge of the matter. Stargate has not committed capital to any data centre project so far.  OpenAI has also expanded its Stargate project overseas, with plans to build a massive data centre in the UAE that was announced as part of Trump\u2019s Gulf tour last week. The 10 sq mile UAE-US AI campus, located in Abu Dhabi and built by Emirati AI company G42, is planned to have 5GW of data centre power \u2014 equivalent to more than 2mn of AI chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s latest generation of GB200 chips.  Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. JPMorgan and OpenAI declined to comment.",

        "content": "Investors on Friday morning got an unpleasant reminder that President Trump still really likes tariffs. Stockstumbled on Fridayafter Trump shot off a couple of early morning Truth Social posts aimed at two of his favorite targets. Trump first insisted that Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on all iPhones made outside the U.S.About 30 minutes later, the president posted: \u201cThe European Union\u2026 has been very difficult to deal with\u2026 Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\u201d The social media posts were a harsh reminder that Trump will continue to use tariffs\u2014and the threat of them\u2014as a foreign and economic policy cudgel, and that U.S. policy will be set according to the president\u2019s whims. Trump\u2019s threats injected fresh uncertainty into a market buoyed in the last month by optimism that tariffs will settle below the rates that, when unveiled in early April,tanked stocks. Trump\u2019s decision to pause his sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs the day after the S&P 500closed near a 1-year lowreassured investors that the president was paying attention to Wall Street, despite his saying he wasn\u2019t. Unfortunately for investors, Friday\u2019s threats are arguably a sign that Trump is watching markets, and that he may feel emboldened when stocks are rising. \u201cTariffs are a dial, not an on-off switch,\u201d market research firm Renaissance Macro Research posted to X on Friday morning. \u201cStocks go up, he may feel like he has license to turn the dial back on. Stocks go down enough, the opposite is true.\u201d Despite Friday\u2019s jolt, many analysts remain confident that the economy can weather tariff-related turbulence. \u201cAlthough policy uncertainty injects more investment uncertainty, we believe this is part of the negotiating thesis to cut individual or regional deals,\u201d said Eric Teal, Chief Investment Officer for Comerica Wealth Management, of Trump\u2019s EU tariff threat. \u201cWe still believe that most companies and the economy are well positioned to power through the temporary higher import prices.\u201d Stocks are also expected to pull through. \u201cWe remain positive on equities,\u201d wrote John Stoltzfus, Chief Investment Strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, in a note earlier this week. Stock market fundamentals, he said, paint a picture of \u201ca very much intact bull market,\u201d driven by the Fed\u2019s success in tempering inflation, solid corporate earnings growth, and a stable job market. UBS earlier this month downgraded U.S. equities from Attractive to Neutral, citing limited upside after the market\u2019s strong post-\u201cLiberation Day\u201d rebound and the likelihood of elevated volatility. Still, the firm expects \u201cgrowing political, business, and legal challenges will generally see [reciprocal tariffs] reduced or removed,\u201d wrote Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer of Global Wealth Management at UBS, in a note on Thursday. UBS expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 6,000\u2014about 4% above its level on Friday\u2014and stand at 6,400 next June. \u201cIn other words, our tactical Neutral view is not bearish, nor is it a call to sell equities,\u201d wrote Haefele.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) plans to invest approximately $40 billion in high-performance chips from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power OpenAI\u2019s new AI-focused data center in Texas, according to a report from The Financial Times. The move underscores the accelerating arms race among tech giants to secure the infrastructure needed to support next-generation artificial intelligence models. The facility, located in Abilene, Texas, is part of a $500 billion initiative led by OpenAI and SoftBank Group. As the first Stargate U.S. site, the data center is expected to support 1.2 gigawatts of computing power when fully operational by mid-2026. Oracle intends to acquire roughly 400,000 of Nvidia\u2019s GB200 chips, the company\u2019s most advanced processors for AI training and inference. Rather than operate the center directly, Oracle will lease the computing capacity to OpenAI under a reported 15-year agreement. The Texas site will be among the world\u2019s largest when completed, solidifying both Oracle\u2019s and OpenAI\u2019s ambitions in large-scale infrastructure. The announcement follows a separate collaboration unveiled this week between the three companies, alongside G42, SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984), and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), to build Stargate UAE, a 1-gigawatt AI cluster headquartered in Abu Dhabi. The UAE facility will be housed within the larger UAE\u2013U.S. AI Campus and is designed to support global-scale AI advancement across industries. As chip demand surges, Oracle\u2019s multi-year investment signals confidence not only in Nvidia\u2019s hardware but also in OpenAI\u2019s ability to lead the next era of compute-intensive applications. \u201cAI is the most transformative force of our time,\u201d said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week. \u201cWith Stargate, we are building the infrastructure to power the future.\" Related articles Oracle to spend $40 billion on Nvidia chips for OpenAI data center - FT TSX closes mixed amid more Trump trade turmoil U.S. Steel shares surge after Trump supports Nippon pact",

        "content": "US equities (^DJI,^IXIC,^GSPC) took a hit in Friday's session after President Trump threatened a new 50% tariff against European Union (EU) nations. The indexes ended up closing out the trading week at a loss of over 2% each. Argent Capital Management Portfolio Manager Jed Ellerbroek comes on Market Domination to discuss his latest stock picks in industrial equipment company United Rentals (URI), Oracle (ORCL), and \u2014 ahead of its earnings release on Wednesday, May 28 \u2014 Nvidia (NVDA). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Against that backdrop, Jed, as I said, listen, you have to put money to work. You got to find opportunities. I'm interested in reviewing some of those. So let's give people some some investment ideas. One name you like, United rentals, uh, Jed, ticker URI. Why is that one of buy in your opinion? Yeah. Yeah, we've we've owned United rentals for years and we think it's an outstanding business. The the kind of core reason we like it is because in America and in most other developed countries, the users of construction equipment are gradually, but consistently, um, shifting from owning and maintaining the equipment themselves to renting it instead from the big rental yards like United rentals and Sunbelt. So that is a kind of a steady, consistent boost to demand for United rentals and its industry. And then on top of that, United is just a very well-managed company. They dominate the industry. They've got the most locations. Um, so that means with these big mega projects going on around the United States building semiconductor manufacturing, battery manufacturing, all the airport construction and hospital construction that you see when you when you drive around urban areas, those people want to use one contractor nationwide. And so United is the natural choice for big construction projects like that and the big contractors that serve them. So, uh, good business, consistent demand, and uh, demand is hanging in there pretty well despite what seems like a kind of uncertain economic environment. The company hosted an investor event earlier this week and had mostly positive things to say. So it's a stock that we continue to like and have as a big position in our urgent large cap portfolio. And then, Jed, um, let's talk about, uh, Big Cap tech and specifically the kind of AI related trade here, right? And is going to be a big event next week when we get earnings from that company. Um, there was a report today that Oracle was dropping what, something like $40 billion according to the FT on, um, on chips for some of the open AI data centers. So it seems like the the spigot is still on. What does that mean for investors? Yeah, I think, so you're right, earnings next week. We know about the bad news the company will report, you know, the right down to the H20 inventory that was going to be directed toward China. The company's going to take a five and a half billion dollar right off on that. They're going to lose future revenues that would have been tied to those products. So that's the negative that the company's already told us about. I think the the guide for next quarter will be will be decent despite that, which is pretty impressive. And then I think the company's going to speak toward optimism looking further out. And that's mostly tied to what what you mentioned, which is really a new class of customers for those accelerator chips. We're not just talking about, you know, the the hyperscalars, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, buying video chips to put into their cloud computing data centers, but we're talking about enterprise demand for video chips, and we're talking about sovereign AI, which are these foreign countries wanting data centers built in their countries filled with video chips. So, uh, I think that Nvidia still faces a really, really strong demand environment. They are more more supply constrained than they are demand constrained.",

The S&P 500 recorded its fourth straight negative trading session on Friday, declining 0.7%. The Dow was down 0.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped 1.0%. Deckers Outdoor (DECK)\u00a0shares plummeted 20%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock. The parent company of the Hoka and Ugg footwear brandsrefrained from providing full-year guidancefor fiscal 2026, citing uncertainties related to tariffs and trade policy. The company has a significant manufacturing footprint in China, and its nearer-term net sales forecast (for the fiscal first quarter) came in below consensus estimates. Alackluster subscription revenue outlookweighed on shares of cloud-based software provider Workday (WDAY), which sank about 13%. Although the company topped sales and profit expectations, Workday predicted softening spending on its human capital management software by its enterprise clients. Analysts have also pointed to potential pricing pressure amid stiffening competition in human resources and financial management software. Discount retailer Ross Stores (ROST)\u00a0alsoshelved its full-year guidance, pointing to a lack of visibility on tariffs and their potential business impact. The company's CEO indicated that, while direct imports account for a limited fraction of its merchandise, more than half of the products sold at Ross originate in China, so higher tariffs could hinder profitability. Ross shares plunged 9.8% on Friday. Shares of tax and accounting software firm Intuit (INTU) secured the top daily performance in the S&P 500, surging 8.1%. The owner of TurboTax and Credit Karmasurpassed sales and profit projectionsfor its fiscal third quarter, while its increased full-year forecasts also topped consensus expectations.

        "content": "Early in the year, Nvidia (NVDA) shares sank on the news of DeepSeek and worries that it could lead totech giants spending less on AI. That, combined with concerns about export restrictions, has some investors nervous. Find out what Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson thinks about it all in the video above. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. You know to to start the the year Matt, was it true that the stock was struggling? There's different reasons for that. One reason was Deep Seek. and Nvidia executives addressed that. In your opinion, did they did they address that concern to your satisfaction, Matt? Do you think that concern is in the rear view mirror? I I certainly think it's in the rear view mirror, Josh. So if you look at what actually happened um with Deep Seek, so predominantly a China phenomenon. Deep Seek was driving significantly more demand than expected for AI servers in China. Um and so I I think at the end of the day, um what you saw from Deep Seek was it it was good news for Nvidia. It was more demand. Um so I think that concern is certainly behind them. Matt, one of the other um reports related to Nvidia that we got today came courtesy of the Financial Times, which said Oracle was planning to spend about $40 billion on Nvidia's GB200 chips um to power OpenAI's new data center. I I I don't know if this is a surprise because if they were building the data center, it was likely they were going to get Nvidia's chips. But um but it does speak to the reliance of Nvidia on spending from the hyperscalers. So what can we expect in terms of cadence with that spending? Yeah, so you saw earlier Crusoe um also announced that they'd secured funding to build out those facilities. So, and I I think when you look at the news from the Financial Times, let's assume it's accurate. They're talking about GB200 chips. So the the current generation of product, that tells you that's going to come earlier, uh let's call it in the next two, three, four quarters. Um and so from a from a cadence perspective, Julie, I think if it doesn't show up in Q2 um for Nvidia it shows up in Q3, Q4 uh because when you get beyond um Q4, you really start to see GB300, the the next generation of chip becoming the the larger portion of volume out of Nvidia. Matt, another big question of course top of mind for Nvidia investors was the AI boom and whether Big Tech would continue to invest so much in that boom. You heard those last earnings reports, Matt, you know, from Meta and Microsoft and Alphabet and and when they talked about their capex guides, they they remain confident. I'm just curious when you look past 2025, Matt, you try to look in 2026, what do you see AI spending looking like from from the hyperscalers? Yeah, so it's it's hard to peg how much hyperscale growth there will be in 2026, and that's always that's always kind of been the question, right? Can we continue to see the the large clouds grow their spend like we've seen the the last few years. Um the difference this time I think, um and I think your prior guest talked to this, we have all this incremental additional spend coming from uh these these projects that are outside the hyperscalers. Um so in particular the sovereign deals we've got uh both Saudi Arabia and UAE and remember that I believe it was the UAE number in terms of chips that was larger than the amount of product that Oracle is supposedly buying. Um so these large deals are really additive and and I don't see the cloud stepping away. Um the last thing I'd add there is, so one of the concerns has simply been that applications aren't going to show up. I I think when you see Open AI go out and spend uh the significant amount amount of money they did on Johnny Ive startup, that tells you that there are edge products that are getting close to being ready. And I think those edge products are going to be AI driven and again, um at the end of the day, that ends up creating growth for AI silicon like Nvidia produces.",

That said, let\u2019s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company\u2019s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia\u2019s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI venture, Humain. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Based on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Regarding Nvidia\u2019s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125. Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLAbut being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia\u2019s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant\u2019s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.

        "header": "Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture",
        "content": "The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week\u2019s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members. It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back. A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia\u2019s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia\u2019s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper. Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up. While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it. In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren\u2019t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues. You can see this Q1 earnings growth in the chart below, which also shows the deceleration in the Mag 7 group\u2019s earnings growth over the coming periods. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Beyond Nvidia, the earnings focus will remain on big-box retailers, with Costco coming out with results. Costco has been a true category leader, with a higher-income customer group that is loyal to the company\u2019s value offerings. Costco is better positioned to navigate the uncertain tariff environment than many other retailers. The company\u2019s U.S. business accounts for more than 70% of its revenues, and two-thirds of the merchandise in Costco U.S. is sourced domestically. Of the imported merchandise, roughly one-third of the total comes from China, Mexico, and Canada combined, and no one country is a dominant supplier. Costco is expected to report $4.25 per share in earnings on $63.1 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +12.4% and +7.9%, respectively. Estimates have inched up since the quarter got underway, with the current $4.25 estimate up from $4.24 a month back and $4.23 two months ago. Costco\u2019s earnings and revenues in the current fiscal year (ends in August 2025) are expected to increase +11.5% and +7.9% from the preceding year\u2019s levels, respectively. The company remains well-positioned to sustain this growth momentum in the following year as well on the back of mid-single-digit comp growth and growth in membership fee income in high-single digits. No doubt, the stock has been a standout performer, handily outperforming the broader market (+10.3% vs. -1.2%) in the year-to-date period. With respect to theRetail sector 2025 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 28 of the 33 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes Costco, Walmart, other traditional retailers, online vendors like Amazon AMZN, and restaurant players. Total Q1 earnings for these 28 retailers that have reported are up +11.2% from the same period last year on +5% higher revenues, with 60.7% beating EPS estimates and only 57.1% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As you can see above, the EPS and revenue beats percentages for these companies are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. Concerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 28 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +42.6% on +8.6% higher revenues, beating EPS and top-line expectations. As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the COVID-19 lockdowns. The two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As you can see above, earnings for the group outside of Amazon are down -5% on a +3.8% top-line gain, which points to margin pressures for the group. The Q1 Earnings Scorecard Through Friday, May 23rd, we have seen Q1 results from 478 S&P 500 members or 95.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. With less than two dozen S&P 500 members still to report results at this stage, the Q1 reporting cycle has actually ended for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with just a few companies still left to report for each of the remaining 6 sectors. Earnings for these 478 index members that have reported results are up +11.6% from the same period last year on +4.3% revenue gains, with 74.3% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 63% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates for these index members in a historical context. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As you can see here, the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 74.3% comparing to the average for the same group of 78.3% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). The Q1 revenue beats percentage of 63% compares to the 5-year average for this group of index members of 71.1%. Is the Turnaround in Estimates for Real? Looking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 478 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +12.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, which would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period. The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2025 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research We have been flagging consistently in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, as you can see in the chart below. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The magnitude of cuts to 2025 Q2 estimates since the start of the period is bigger and more widespread relative to what we have become used to seeing in the post-COVID period. But you have likely noticed in recent weeks that we have been pointing to signs of stabilization in Tech sector estimates, both for Q2 as well as full-year 2025. The chart below shows how Tech sector earnings estimates for the period appear to bottom in the second half of April, but may have started coming down again. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research We see this same trend at play in annual estimates as well. The chart below shows the Tech sector\u2019s evolving earnings expectations for full-year 2025. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research We knew something was up, as the early signs of these revision trends started showing up in the data. It may be premature to say that the trend has completely reversed. But it nevertheless shows that the revisions trend has stabilized. The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.
