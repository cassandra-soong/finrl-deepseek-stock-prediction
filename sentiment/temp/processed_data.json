        "header": "AMD vs. Nvidia: Which Artificial Intelligence Stock Should You Buy on the Dip?",
        "content": "Has the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) stocks cooled off? Many top AI stocks are down this year, includingAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.31%), better known as just AMD, andNvidia(NVDA0.28%). They have both declined around 15% thus far in 2025, which is worse thanS&P 500's more modest drop of 4%. There's still massive potential for AI to revolutionize businesses and entire industries, but investors have been starting to scale back their positions in AI. If, however, you're looking at the long haul, then now can be a great time to add a top AI stock to your portfolio. Which of these two chip stocks is the better option right now: AMD or Nvidia? Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of $2.8 trillion. That has come down a bit amid its recent decline (last year it was well above $3 trillion), but it's still close to 17 times the value of AMD, which has a market cap of around $165 billion. While AMD isn't a small company by any means, when compared to Nvidia, it looks tiny. While you might think that Nvidia is the pricier of the two stocks given its massive valuation, based on earnings, it's actually thecheaperstock.  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts Last year, AMD reported $1.6 billion in profit, while Nvidia, which has a fiscal year that ends in January, has generated an incredible $72.9 billion in earnings over its last four quarters. Not only has its business been experiencing explosive growth, but Nvidia's bottom line has been growing quickly as itsprofit marginhas averaged 56%. That has enabled its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to remain relatively low. By comparison, AMD's profit margin is just 6%. And with a more modest bottom line, it's the more expensive stock of the two when taking into account its earnings per share. Both stocks have been struggling this year but when looking at the past 12 months, Nvidia is still up around 29% while AMD has fallen by 33%. A case could be made that AMD may be due for a rally, especially if its AI chips prove to offer formidable competition to Nvidia's high-priced options. AMD CEO Lisa Su previously forecast that the company could generate \"tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue\" in the near future due to its AI chips. If AMD can generate that much growth, it can certainly help attract more investors and propel the stock to a much higher valuation. Thus far, it's lagged behind Nvidia in a big way. Last year, AMD's sales rose by 14%, while Nvidia more than doubled its revenue during its most recent fiscal year. But what also matters are AMD's margins, which need improvement. Otherwise, its P/E multiple may not come down significantly even if its growth rate accelerates. And a high premium could deter investors. Nvidia is in pole position today, dominating the market and still innovating and coming up with new AI chips. AMD has to prove that it can put up some formidable competition. And until it does, that could limit its upside both in the near term and the long term. AMD can potentially be a great long-term investment but it has a lot of question marks around its operations; it's far from a slam-dunk buy at this stage and it comes with some risk. Not only does it need to show that its chips can provide real competition to Nvidia, but the company also has to improve upon its single-digit profit margin. With much stronger financials, a more attractive valuation, and a more dominant position in the market, Nvidia is the betterAI stockto buy today.",

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) will remain in the spotlight Friday after surging above theclosely watched $100,000 level on Thursdayfor the first time since early February. The legacy cryptocurrency ralliedalong with stocksafter President Donald Trump announced that theU.S. had reached a trade agreement with the U.K. The president also said that further deals could be on the way andexpressed optimism about trade talks with Chinathat are slated to take place this weekend. Bitcoin\u2019s price had fallen sharply between February and April, weighed down byuncertainty about tariffsand their potential impact on the economy, as well as disappointment with the pace of reforms by the Trump administration to support the crypto industry. With the latest surge, bitcoin is nearly 40% above last month\u2019s low and up 10% from the start of the year.

Below, we take a closer look at Bitcoin\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify crucial price levels worth watching out for. After reclaiming the200-day moving average (MA)last month, bitcoin traded within a narrow consolidation period before today\u2019s strongbreakoutabove the all-important $100,000 mark. The move sets the stage for a potential retest of the cryptocurrency\u2019srecord highestablished at $109,000 in late January.

It\u2019s important to note thattrading volumeson Coinbase (COIN), the largestcrypto exchangein the United States, have declined since bitcoin\u2019s move higher started in early April, indicating larger market participants may be sitting out the current rally. Let\u2019s identify two crucial overhead areas on bitcoin\u2019s chart worth watching while also locating keysupportlevels to monitor. The first overhead area to watch sits around $107,000. This location will likely attract significant attention near the prominent December and Januarypeaksthat marked adouble toppattern on the chart. Investors can forecast an overhead area to watch above the cryptocurrency\u2019s record high by using bars pattern analysis. To apply this technique, we take the price bars comprising bitcoin's move higher that preceded the recent consolidation period and reposition them from today\u2019s breakout point. The analysis projects a potentialupsidetarget of around $120,000 assuming acontinuationmove plays out. Short-term profit-taking could see the cryptocurrency\u2019s price revisit the $100,000 level. Following today\u2019s breakout above this keypsychologicalarea, the region may flip from priorresistanceinto future support. However, inability of bulls to successfully defend this level could trigger a more significantretracementin bitcoin's price to $92,000.

        "header": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Today",
        "content": "By the end of last year, \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks may have seemed out of reach for many investors. These top technology players saw their shares surge -- and they even led gains in theS&P 500index -- on optimism about the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize business and our daily lives. The Magnificent Seven players have been aggressively investing in AI, and many of them are leaders in the field, generating billions of dollars in revenue from the technology. But in recent weeks, these leading tech companies have seen their shares decline amid concerns about spending in a potentially difficult economy. President Donald Trump announced a plan for tariffs on imports -- and the concern is that will lead to higher prices on a wide variety of goods and eventually that situation will weigh on the consumer's wallet and corporate earnings. This is a near-term risk, but it's important to remember that many well-established companies have what it takes to manage headwinds and grow over the long term. That's why now is the perfect time to go bargaining hunting, picking out quality stocks trading at low valuations after these recent declines. With that in mind, here are two Magnificent Seven stocks that are screaming buys right now. Image source: Getty Images. I might surprise you when I say one of the best deals around right now isn't necessarily on a small high-risk AI player but instead on the world's top AI company -- one that's proven itself to be key to the industry's development. I'm talking aboutNvidia(NVDA0.28%), the leading maker of AI chips and a company that's generated record earnings quarter after quarter thanks to this market position. Yes, recent stock market declines even hurt Nvidia, dragging it lower so that it now trades at 25xforward earnings estimates-- that's down from about 50x earlier this year. Investors worried that any economic weakness could weigh on the spending plans of Nvidia's customers, but so far, that hasn't happened. In recent earnings reports, top customers such asMicrosofthavereiterated their focuson investing in AI. This bodes well for Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and the ones to follow. Meanwhile, Nvidia's innovation -- including a pledge to update its chips on an annual basis -- should keep it ahead of rivals. Today's tech giants are keen on using the very latest AI tools to supercharge their platforms, and that keeps them coming back to Nvidia. Finally, it's important to note that Nvidia's financial strength, with $43 billion in cash and a high level of profitability on sales -- gross margin has consistently surpassed 70% -- position it well to handle any potential headwinds and win over the long term. That's why, at today's price, it's a screaming buy. Want to get in on the very cheapestMagnificent Sevenstock right now? That's a great idea considering the overall strength of this company in two key markets. This player isAlphabet(GOOG1.97%)(GOOGL1.97%), global leader in the Internet search market through its Google Search platform -- it holds about 90% market share. And Alphabet, through Google Cloud, also is one of the world's top cloud computing companies. These two businesses are helping Alphabet generate billions of dollars in quarterly revenue -- and Alphabet's investment in AI has already started supercharging earnings potential. For example, demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI helped Google Cloud report a 28% increase in revenue in the most recent quarter. Alphabet is winning in AI by offering AI to customers through Google Cloud, and the company also is winning as it uses AI to improve its business. An example here is the company's development of large language model, Gemini, and how it's applied this tool to improve Google Search. In recent quarters, Alphabet has said its use of AI in Google Search has resulted in people relying on Google Search more and more. This is important because Alphabet makes most of its revenue through advertising across the Google platform -- and if people spend more time on Google, advertisers are more likely to keep spending here to reach that audience and even boost spending. All of this makes Alphabet, trading at only 17x forward earnings estimates, look like a buying opportunity you won't want to miss out on right now.",

        "content": "Investors often get an idea in their heads and run with it, pushing prices to extremes that aren't realistic. That's the risk that investors should fear today with artificial intelligence.Nvidia(NVDA0.28%)is pretty much the poster child of the AI industry, with Wall Street hanging on every word the management says. But it won't be a good AI choice for every investor. Here's why you may prefer high-yieldDominion Energy(D-0.27%)instead. Artificial intelligenceis impressive in many ways, and it has been developing very quickly, as well. Just about every major corporation has started to use, or at least experiment with, the technology. There probably isn't a day that goes by that AI isn't given space in a financial newspaper, website, or television channel. It is one of those big-picture trends that has captivated Wall Street. Image source: Getty Images. There are good reasons for that, but it still isn't clear just how impactful the technology will be in the long run. And, equally important, it isn't clear what companies will end up being the big winners or the big losers. Today,chipmakerNvidia is a clear leader, making what amounts to the \"brains\" of AI. And shockingly, Nvidia's valuation doesn't seem overly extreme right now, with its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios both currently below their five-year averages. That said, Nvidia's 39xP/E ratiois above the technology sector's average of around 33x. So it wouldn't be fair to call the stock cheap, either. And don't forget that the early leaders in an industry don't always remain the leaders. Just look at Yahoo!, which was once the go-to search engine but eventually got replaced byAlphabet'sGoogle search tool. In other words, investing in Nvidia today may seem like a good idea, but it still comes with some risks. There's another option when it comes to AI, and that's buying a regulatedelectric utilitylike Dominion Energy. If you want to invest directly in AI, Nvidia will be a better option than Dominion. But there's an important overlap here because AI can't exist without electricity. In fact, data center demand for power is expected to expand by 300% over the next 10 years to satisfy the AI industry's growth. That is going to require material capital investment in the power grid and, in turn, lead to growth for utilities. Dominion is an interesting stock in this regard. For starters, it has gone through a corporate repositioning that has resulted in it now being a pure-play regulated electric utility. However, along the way, the dividend was cut and the current rate is likely to stay the same for a few years while the company brings itsdividend payout ratioback down toward the industry average. The stock is out of favor, offering a dividend yield of 4.9% versus the utility average of 2.9% and Nvidia's itty bitty 0.05% or so. If you are a dividend investor you will clearly find Dominion more attractive than Nvidia. But there's an interesting wrinkle here. Dominion has a monopoly in one of the largest data center markets on the planet. To highlight that, it witnessed 88% growth in demand from data centers between July 2024 and December 2024. This is a core pillar behind the utility's long-term projection of 5% to 7% earnings growth. That's a good number for a utility, and if management can achieve that goal Wall Street will eventually afford Dominion a higher valuation. That kind of growth will also lead to an eventual resumption of dividend growth, which will also be viewed favorably by investors. In other words, Dominion is something of a low-riskturnaroundstory with an AI twist. For long-term dividend investors that will probably be a much more attractive opportunity than buying Nvidia and hoping that it remains in the pole position in AI indefinitely. To be fair, Dominion isn't the only electricity play in the AI sector. There are other utilities that will benefit and some new technology upstarts, too. For exampleBloom Energyoffers power cells that can be deployed more quickly than power lines can be built. AndNuScale Poweris attempting to build a business around small scale nuclear reactors that could be placed right next to AI data centers. But the combination of risk and reward, notably including the stock's loftydividend yield, Dominion offers is hard to ignore if you want to invest in AI but can't quite stomach owning a volatile technology stock.",

        "header": "3 Reasons Nvidia Stock Is Still a Top Artificial Intelligence Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.28%)stock hit some tough headwinds in 2025 -- shares of the chip designer are down 15% year to date as of this writing. However, evidence is piling up that this selloff may not be justified. The stock price pulled back for multiple reasons -- among them, fears of a potential drop inartificial intelligence (AI)hardware spending following the launch of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, the macroeconomic uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's tariffs, and concerns that Nvidia could face rising competition within the AI chip industry. Some of these concerns are overblown. Here are three reasons why Nvidia is a top AI stock to buy in the wake of its recent drop. Source: Getty Images Nvidia stocktook a big blow in Januaryafter Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek claimed that it had trained its R1 reasoning model for a fraction of what major tech companies spend on training theirlarge language models (LLMs). This sparked concerns that companies and governments who have been lining up to buy Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to train and deploy AI models in data centers might cut orders. So far, they haven't. When Nvidia released its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (which ended Jan. 26) results in February, management issued healthy guidance that should have assuaged investors' concerns about GPU demand. Its guidance for revenue of $43 billion in fiscal 2026's Q1 amounted to a year-over-year increase of 65%. That's impressive considering that Nvidia has already attained a big sales base: It ended fiscal 2025 with $130.5 billion in total revenue, more than double its top line in the previous year. Management credited its upbeat guidance to the robust demand for Nvidia's latest generation of Blackwell AI GPUs, which delivered stronger-than-expected revenue last quarter. Looking ahead, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia delivering another set of strong results this month. Recent commentary from tech giants such asMeta Platforms,Microsoft, andAlphabetindicates that their spending on AI data centers continues to remain healthy. Meta, for instance, increased its 2025 capital expenditure guidance by almost 9% to $68 billion at the midpoint of its new range. That higher spending will go toward bolstering the social media giant's AI infrastructure. Microsoft is on track for $80 billion in capital expenditures in its fiscal 2025, and it expects to raise its spending in the next fiscal year since it is facing AI capacity constraints. Even Alphabet has reaffirmed its $75 billion capex guidance for 2025, which would be a 43% increase compared to last year. All this explains whyMorgan Stanleyforecasted a sharp increase in sales of Nvidia's Blackwell processors to $30 billion in Q1 -- nearly triple the revenue it generated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. There have been concerns that competitors could dent Nvidia's terrific growth trajectory, but it looks like the chipmaker remains miles ahead of its rivals in the AI chip market. For instance, Nvidia sold $115 billion worth of data center chips in the previous fiscal year. That was well ahead ofAdvanced Micro Devices' estimated data center GPU sales of $5 billion. EvenBroadcom, which is considered to be the next most important chip company after Nvidia, sold just $12.2 billion worth of AI chips in its most recent fiscal year. Meanwhile,Intelisn't making much progress in data center chips. Chipzilla's revenue from its data center and AI segment was up just 8% in the first quarter of 2025 to $4.1 billion, which points toward a $16.4 billion annual revenue run rate. Moreover, Nvidia is likely to maintain its dominant share of the AI chip market in 2025 thanks to its solid control over the supply chain. The semiconductor bellwether is expected to corner 77% of the AI semiconductor wafers that will be produced this year, up from 51% in 2024. The wafer consumption shares of Intel and AMD are expected to shrink, indicating that Nvidia will continue to control the lion's share of the AI chip market. That should pave the way for terrific long-term growth in Nvidia's data center revenue as the AI chip market is projected to grow at an annualized rate of 35% a year through 2033 Nvidia stock's drop this year and the impressive growth that it has been clocking means that investors can buy it at an attractive valuation right now. Nvidia stock trades at 38 times trailing earnings, much lower than itsprice-to-earnings ratioof 62 at the end of January. Moreover, the forward earnings multiple of 25 points toward a big jump in its bottom line, and is also lower than the U.S. technology sector's earnings multiple of 42. Analysts expect a 48% increase in Nvidia's earnings this year, which would be significantly higher than the 8% average earnings growth that companies in theS&P 500index expect to clock. Nvidia could indeed deliver such strong growth this year thanks to the points discussed above, and there is a chance that it may even outpace analysts' expectations as its margins improve in the second half of the fiscal year, as the production of Blackwell processors ramps up further. So, buying thisAI stocklooks like a no-brainer right now in light of its attractive valuation, dominant position in AI chips, and the tech sector's robust spending on AI infrastructure.",

        "header": "Warren Buffett Grew Berkshire Into a $1 Trillion Company. Can Greg Abel Take It to $2 Trillion?",
        "content": "Between 1964 and 2024,Berkshire Hathaway(BRK.A-1.05%)(BRK.B-0.83%)achieved a staggering 5,502,284% gain compared to 39,054% for theS&P 500(^GSPC0.58%)with dividends reinvested. Compounded annually, Berkshire rose 19.9% versus 10.4% for theindex,with dividends reinvested. During those 60 years, Warren Buffett and his team built Berkshire from a small friends and family operation to a $1.1 trillion market cap at the time of this writing. That puts Berkshire in a league of its own when it comes to non-tech-focused valuations, as the only other U.S.-based companies with market caps of more than $1 trillion areMicrosoft,Apple(AAPL0.63%),Nvidia,Alphabet,Amazon, andMeta Platforms. At Berkshire's latest annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett announced that he wouldstep down as chief executive officer(but remain chairman) at year-end, passing the torch to Greg Abel. Abel runs Berkshire's non-insurance operations. Berkshire fell 5.1% on Monday in response to the news after hitting an all-time high on May 2, as some investors question if Abel can lead Berkshire as effectively as Buffett. Here's why Abel will have a far easier time growing Berkshire into a $2 trillion company than Buffett had building the company from scratch, and the advantages that could help Berkshire remain a compounding machine for years to come. Image source: Getty Images. Berkshire's history is a lesson in the power of compounding. It took Berkshire 54 years to reach a half-trillion-dollar market cap (at the beginning of 2018) and less than seven years to go from a half-trillion to $1 trillion in 2024. If Berkshire's stock price goes up 10% a year, which is roughly what the S&P 500 has averaged throughout Berkshire's history, then Berkshire would double in just over seven years. Even if Berkshire's stock price only goes up by 5% a year -- which is a pretty bleak forecast -- it would still double in just over 14 years. Berkshire can reach a $2 trillion market cap even with mediocre gains. But the better question is whether Berkshire has what it takes to be a winning investment for long-term investors. Three basic factors can drive Berkshire's stock price higher. Berkshire's stock price will naturally go up if the value of its stock holdings increases. This is what has happened over time with successful Berkshire investments such asAmerican Express,Coca-Cola, and, more recently, Apple. At the annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett said Tim Cook made more money for Berkshire than he ever made -- a nod to the enormous gain Berkshire booked on its Apple stake since 2016. If Berkshire deploys a significant amount of capital on another winner like Apple, it will drive Berkshire's stock price higher. The second factor is that Berkshire's operating earnings could increase from its controlled businesses, which would likely rise in value over time. Buffett has long preferred to focus on operating earnings rather than net income because operating earnings provide a better reading on how its controlled businesses are doing. Berkshire is coming off a record year of operating earnings thanks to outperformance from its insurance businesses. Last year was an outlier for underwriting due to a large difference between premiums collected and claims paid. Already in Q1 2025, Berkshire's underwriting earnings were significantly lower than Q1 2024, a sign that the business is normalizing. The more stable aspect of Berkshire's insurance businesses is its insurance investment income. Berkshire makes money on its float, which is the sum of premiums collected that haven't been paid in claims. The float acts as a safety net that Berkshire can tap into to cover claims. But in the meantime, it can invest the float and make a return. Over time, the float has compounded in value at an impressive rate. As of March 31, Berkshire's float was about $173 billion -- up from $130 billion five years ago and just over double the $83.5 billion it was 10 years ago. In the most recent quarter, Berkshire earned $2.893 billion in insurance investment income thanks to its huge float. Ten years ago, it earned just $1.087 billion in insurance investment income. The gradual growth of Berkshire's float is a straightforward way to compound operating earnings and drive Berkshire's stock price higher. Aside from the insurance businesses, Berkshire generates significant operating earnings from its manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses and its ownership of BNSF Railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). Abel has been instrumental in increasing operating earnings at BHE and has assumed increasing responsibilities over Berkshire's other controlled assets. Investor sentiment is the third factor that can drive Berkshire's market cap higher. This factor is more abstract than the others, but it has arguably had the biggest impact on Berkshire's stock price in recent years. Theprice-to-book (P/B) ratiohas historically been one of Buffett's preferred financial metrics for measuring Berkshire's intrinsic value because it focuses on Berkshire's assets. Whereasprice-to-earningsis based on earnings per share, which again can vary based on Berkshire's conglomerate model. A P/B below 1.1 or 1.2 used to be the level at which Berkshire wouldconsistently repurchase its shares. But Berkshire's P/B has soared in recent years, and Berkshire hasn't repurchased stock since Q2 2024 -- breaking a24 consecutive quarter streak. Berkshire's P/B ratio sits at 1.7 at the time of this writing, up from its 10-year median of 1.4. So by that metric, Berkshire's valuation is already a bit extended from historical levels. Berkshire is worth buying if you believe the company can continue making sound investments in public securities, increase the operating earnings of its controlled businesses, and that the stock deserves its elevated valuation. Berkshire has an impeccable track record of managing its controlled businesses. It has numerous advantages in insurance and does a good job earning income from its float while avoidingthe pitfalls of overleveragethat other insurance companies fall into. All told, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising if Berkshire blasted above a $2 trillion market cap in the next five to 10 years under Greg Abel's leadership.",

The company behind its namesake travel booking platform and others like Vrbo and Hotels.com reported revenue of $2.99 billion and $31.45 billion in total bookings, both up from the same time last year but below what analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected. Expedia posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.40, up 90% year-over-year and better than Visible Alpha consensus, but its reported net loss per share of $1.56 was more than triple the $0.42 that analysts had forecast. CEO Ariane Gorin said the company managed to grow bookings and revenue \"despite weaker than expected demand in the U.S.\" as consumer sentiment has worsened amid tariff-fueled uncertainty. Gorin added on the earnings call that travel trends continued to be soft through April, and said more European customers appear to be traveling to other locales like Latin America rather than the U.S., according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. CFO Scott Schenkel said Expedia projects 2% to 4% bookings growth and 3% to 5% revenue growth in the second quarter, but the company trimmed its full-year forecast for both metrics to 2% to 4% growth from the 4% to 6% rate they laid out in last quarter's earnings call.

        "header": "How Long Do Bear Markets Last?",
        "content": "Bear markets,\u00a0defined as a 20% or more pullback from recent highs, typically last for an average of between nine and fifteen months. They are an inevitable phase of market cycles that move from expansion to contraction and vice versa. However, these downturns eventually end, and the market climbs higher in the long run. Checking data from Yardeni Research, since and including the market crash that sparked the Great Depression, the S&P 500 index has had 22 bear markets, even as those invested long-term have had positive returns over time. Still, abear marketcan cause significant short-term losses for investors. Understanding how long they typically last and what influences their length can help you keep perspective when there's market tumult. Working with data from Yardeni Research, we get an average duration of about 11.4 months since 1928 for bear markets in theS&P 500 index, with a full recovery (back to the previous peak) typically around 2.5 years. The data can help you stay calm while others panic, though a lot depends on where you have your investments. For example, theNasdaq 100, an index of the 100 most valuable stocks on that exchange, which tends to be tech-heavy, took\u00a0more than 15 years to come back to its previous peak after thedot-com bust. There are three main categories of bear markets: Economic shocks and unexpected events, such as pandemics and geopolitical conflicts, can cause event-driven bear markets.\u00a0The early 2020 downturn triggered by the pandemic serves as a prime example.\u00a0Despite a rapid and steep decline of over 30%, this bear market lasted only about one month because of swift and coordinated policy responses that restoredinvestor confidence. Cyclical bear markets occur in tandem with broader economic slowdowns orrecessions.\u00a0These often last longer, as can be seen in the table below, because they develop from persistent macroeconomic issues, such as increasing interest rates, unemployment, and falling corporate earnings. Bear markets may also develop when fundamental shifts or imbalances occur afterspeculative bubblesburst or financial crises take place.Also known as \"secular\" bear markets, these can see drastic drops of more than 50% and require a longer recovery lasting years or even decades (e.g., Japan from the 1990s through the 2000s), as the economy recalibrates to the new reality. While the averages provide a useful guide, it's also helpful to know how short or long they have lasted: The bear market of March 2020, at theonset of the pandemic, is the shortest on record. The S&P 500 plunged more than 30% in just 33 trading days before rallying to new highs within four months.This rapid recovery was largely due tounprecedented fiscal stimulusand monetary policy support, along with investors\u2019 desire to quickly reenter the market after such a steep decline. While it's still too early to tell, the brief bear market that accompaniedTrump's sweeping tariffsmay end up being the shortest on record (a matter of just a few days), before the President reversed course, causing markets to rebound, though with significant volatility remaining. Determining which is the longest U.S. bear market depends on the method used. Looking at multiple indexes, researchers have identified a 61-month period (about five years) ending March 1942 as the longest.The 60% market decline was sparked by the economic and geopolitical disruptionsof World War\u202fII. Other metrics point to the 1929\u20131932 downturn of the Great Depression, which lasted 33 to 48 months (again, depending on methodology). This period saw the Dow lose up to 89% of its value before returning to steady gains.The S&P index's longest bear market came after the dot-com bubble burst. Bear markets typically last a little less than a year, but the duration and recovery time depend on the cause of the decline and underlying fundamentals. While downturns can be painful for investors, they do eventually end, and the stock market returns to a long-term growth trend.",

        "header": "When Experts Say 'The Stock Market Is Not the Economy,' What Do They Mean?",
        "content": "The market turmoil caused by President Trump's 2025 tariff announcements has experts reassessing a longstanding maxim: \"The stock market is not the economy.\" Brenton Harrison, a certified financial planner, founder of New Money New Problems, and a member of Investopedia's Advisor Council, pointed to reasons to rethink the dictum. Many investors now trade for themselves via apps like Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) and other platforms, which has \"increased Main Street\u2019s interest in Wall Street,\" he said. \"By having skin in the game, Main Street investors are more attuned to activities on Wall Street that impact their daily lives and portfolios.\" So, is this part of a narrowing of the supposed gap between Wall Street and Main Street? We suggest possible answers below. The notion that the stock market isn't the economy is decades old. Kai Ryssdal of \"Marketplace\" popularized the phrase just before the2008 Financial Crisis, emphasizing that one shouldn't confuse what's happening in one with the other.Thestock markettracks the value and expected future earnings of publicly traded companies, while the economy comprises all U.S. production, consumption, employment, and commerce. Ryssdal still stresses the point, though in a manner that's somehow both blunter and more nuanced. For example, in March 2025, he seconded a Bluesky post by noted economistPaul Krugman,who repeated the phrase three times, then wrote, \"Nonetheless, holy sh*t,\" citing market fears about Trump administration tariffs. As Krugman put it a few years ago, \"The relationship between stock performance\u2014largely driven by the oscillation between greed and fear\u2014and real economic growth has always been somewhere between loose and nonexistent.\"This means, as a March 2025 Economic Policy Institute report put it, \"More often what is happening to stock prices gives us no insight into the wider economy.\" The market is also not very representative of the U.S. economy: More American families than ever own stocks\u2014more than 60% own stocks either directly or indirectly through their retirement plans, but only about a fifth own stocks directly. Meanwhile, the richest 10% of American families own nearly 90% of all stocks. Still, some argue for using the market's ups and downs as an economic barometer. For example, during his first administration, President Donald Trump invoked a rising stock market as evidence of his economic stewardship, suggesting policies doing the opposite should be abandoned. That would mean a \u00a0\u201cstock market veto,\" largely by the wealthiest Americans (and not a few foreigners).Policy shifts from the New Deal to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 and beyond have caused market drops. Yet, regarding the ACA, the market reaction wasn't even a good barometer of how healthcare stocks would fare. For example, we calculate that despite an initial price drop, the Health Care SPDR ETF (XLV) rose about 387% between the ACA's passage and April 2025\u2014higher than theS&P 500 index's impressive 354%. There's a saying among investors and analysts that in a crisis, everything is correlated, which means that everyone is selling everything. In this context, perhaps it's helpful to add that, while in ordinary times the stock market does not reflect the economy, in times of crisis both are greatly affected. For example, Wolfers said there's good reason to take heed of the market's reaction to Trump's tariffs. The turmoil in equities and bonds is evidence that Wall Street isn't buying Trump's argument that his tariffs, which would fundamentally restructure global trade, will lead to greater profitability and a more robust American economy, he says. \"Ordinarily, I have a lot of sympathy for the statement that the stock market is not the economy,\" Wolfers said. \"But I think this time it's more central to understanding what's going on in the economy.\" Crucially, plunging markets can hit the economy by damaging consumer sentiment. Even though most stocks are held by wealthier families, when markets and the value of401(k)sare falling, this dominates news broadcasts, Main Street takes notice, with people often quickly cutting their spending, which in turn slows economic growth. \"This month\u2019s market activity shows that companies and governments recognize how fast consumer sentiment can change an economy,\" Harrison said. \"In past times of turbulence\u2014the Great Recession, the early 2000s tech bubble\u2014some of the market forces that led to a crash were in motion for years before Main Street was aware of them. ...Recent market events have shown that the time between a Wall Street activity and Main Street\u2019s reaction to it has whittled down to days.\" \"The stock market is not the economy\" is a reminder that stock market troubles don't necessarily lead to slowing economic growth\u2014hence economistPaul Samuelson's joke in 1966 that \"Wall Street indexes [have] predicted nine out of the last five recessions.\" That said, markets can influence the economy. They help businesses fund growth, offer investments for millions of Americans, and perhaps, as Wolfers suggests, provide important insights about certain policies. The relationship is thus more nuanced than screaming headlines about stock market crashes might lead one to believe.",

Co-CEO Hilton Schlosberg said during the firm's earnings call that April \"was a really robust month,\" according to an AlphaSense transcript. Co-CEO Rodney Sacks added the company estimates that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, last month's sales were nearly 17% higher than in April 2024, and 18% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment.

        "content": "Stocks were buoyed Thursday bya U.S.-U.K. trade agreement, the first deal to come out of a month of negotiations. Now the question is: Can future deals continue to impress Wall Street? The U.S. and U.K. announced a trade deal framework yesterday that eases automobile, steel, and aluminum tariffs, and opens the British market up to an estimated $6 billion of U.S. goods. The deal also included a commitment by a U.K. airline to purchase more than $10 billion worth of Boeing (BA) jets, an acquisition announced by British Airways parent IAG on Friday. The framework leaves in place a 10% tariff on all imports, a sign to some that the baseline rateisn't going anywhere. \"If the 10% global tariff is here to stay, the only other major tariff relief could come from a de-escalation with China,\" Michael Pearce, Deputy Chief U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics, wrote on Thursday. American and Chinese officials will meet in Switzerland this weekend to hold their first talks since the onset of their tit-for-tat trade war. The stakes are high. Shipments from China to the U.S. reportedly slumped more than 20% in April after Trump raised tariffs by more than 100%.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called current rates \"unsustainable\" and said the world's two largest economies have effectively embargoed each other.\u00a0Trump on Friday floated the idea of lowering duties on Chinese goods to 80% from a maximum of 145% today. The U.K. \"deal was low-hanging fruit,\" Pearce wrote. The U.S., he notes, runs a trade surplus with the U.K., meaning Britain never was subject to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs announced on April 2. The two countries also have a long history of cooperation. It will be much harder to develop a similar framework with China, considering both the scale of trade and the animosity between the two parties.\u00a0Given the challenges, \"we are sceptical that tariff relief is on the near-term horizon,\" Pearce said. Trump has said this weekend's talks with China could be \"substantive,\" but the scope of the U.K. deal could temper Wall Street's expectations. \"Tellingly, the deal did not touch on more contentious issues, such as opening healthcare markets to US providers or the UK's digital services tax,\" Pearce wrote. That could signal that \"other countries will be unwilling to offer significant politically difficult concessions in return for minor tariff relief.\" Economists at middle-market consultancy RSM dubbed Thursday's framework \"the U.S.-UK trade agreement that isn't.\" They called the framework \"neither comprehensive nor complete,\" and said it \"does not provide the clarity necessary to lift the fog of uncertainty.\" A U.K. trade deal may be a cakewalk compared with China, but it's still \"an important test case and a model for what could be accomplished,\" says Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer at Northlight Asset Management. \"If the administration can follow this up with additional agreements, it would go a long way toward healing a stock market that has been battered and bruised this year.\"",

        "content": "When the markets are dropping and your portfolio is falling with it, the instinct is to sell everything, cut your losses, and stick with cash. However, history shows that remaining invested is the best choice over the long run. Volatility is normal. Stocks undergo intra-year declines of about 16%, yet generate positive calendar-year returns around 80% of the time, demonstrating resilience. Panic sellingis rarely the smart move. So, before you consider pulling your money out, it pays to understand how a disciplined approach can help you achieve long-term gains. Significantvolatilityin the market refers to the stomach-churning ups and downs of stock prices that can cause even seasoned investors to question their strategies. These swings happen when new information hits the market\u2014surprise earnings reports, economic news, or global events that make investors rethink what companies are worth. A low-volatility asset experiences minimal movement, while a high-volatility asset can see significant daily swings.While the word \"volatility\" is heard most often when the market is swinging wildly, it's a regular occurrence\u2014like waves in the sea. Every significant downturn in U.S. history (thus far) has beenfollowed by eventual recoveries. Those who keep their investments during these periods often achieve the best results in the long run. Selling investments during a downturn locks in losses and eliminates the chance to benefit once the market recovers.Retail investorsoften do the exact opposite of the buy-low, sell-high maxim\u2014selling after sharp declines and missing the market\u2019s strongest rallies. Moreover,timing the marketrequires getting it right twice: when selling and when you buy, a risky strategy even for seasoned professionals. Since 1929, theaverage length of a bear marketin the U.S. has been around 11 months, so they typically last less than a year, even if the stress and drama of them lasts far longer. They occur about once every five years, so they are also not unusual\u2014the last one was in 2022, with swings in April 2025 coming close. Diversifyingacross different asset classes, sectors, and geographies helps mitigate the effects of poor performance in any one stock or asset type. Bonds and alternative assets like commodities tend to behave differently from equities, which helps stabilize a portfolio when stocks drop. Dollar-cost averagingis another smart strategy that involves investing fixed amounts at regular intervals\u2014putting a percentage of each paycheck in your 401(k) is an example of this\u2014that helps avoid timing while also ensuring you are buying during periods of lower prices. Young people can afford to stay invested in equities thanks to their longer time horizons, which allow them to ride out short-term swings. Essentially, the younger you are, the less you need to worry about a bear market. Retiring during one, however, creates genuine risk because ofsequence-of-returnsproblems\u2014withdrawing from declining investments can permanently damage your portfolio's long-term value. If you're within five years of retirement, consider building a cash buffer covering one to two years of expenses and gradually shift toward more conservative allocations using a rule of thumb like the \"100-minus-your-age\" rule (e.g., 40% stocks/60% bonds at age 60). Building up anemergency fundseparate from your investments (three to six months of expenses) can help you avoid selling should your finances take a major hit. While panic selling is typically unwise, there are real problems you might face that require you to pull out funds from your investments\u2014a job loss, medical emergencies, or other financial hardships. In these situations, consider selling only what's absolutely necessary, starting with bonds, other stable assets, and stocks most unlikely to make gains in a rebound. You begin with these since they aren't going to increase in value as much as, say, your shares in a tech stock. Panic selling often exacerbates losses and derails financial goals. While volatility can be unnerving, it is a routine feature of markets. Stay invested and disciplined\u2014and resist the temptation to pull out entirely.",

        "header": "How to Retire When You Own a Business",
        "content": "Business owners have a special opportunity when planning for their financial future\u2014when the time comes to retire, they can sell their business and combine those proceeds with money that they've been saving over the years in a retirement account. However, some business owners discover that when it\u2019s time to retire, they haven\u2019t planned carefully enough (or at all) for life after owning a business. Unlike employees withpensionsor401(k)s, entrepreneurs need to navigate saving for retirement as they grow their business and plan for their exit. They also need to develop a tax-smart retirement savings withdrawal plan that aligns with their business exit and retirement. Otherwise, both personal and professional goals can slip out of reach. Here's what business owners need to know to avoid common planning pitfalls and to retire on their own terms. As an entrepreneur, understanding your personal vision forretirement\u2014whether it incorporates travel, family support, or philanthropy\u2014makes it easier to create a financial roadmap that isn't tied entirely to a future sale of your business. Set yourretirement goalsbased on this vision, and work toward them by both, building your business and adding to your savings consistently. \"Many business owners overestimate the value of their business and delay saving outside of it,\" saysChristopher Stroup, founder of Silicon Beach Financial. He says you should treat business and personal goals as \u201ctwo parallel tracks.\u201d Saving separately ensures you're retiring by choice, not because the business demands it. Chris Diodato, CFP and founder of WELLth Financial Planning, echoes this. \"It\u2019s paramount to have at least some separate funds not associated with the business earmarked for retirement savings,\" he said. Business owners have several powerful retirement savings options. For those running solo,SEP IRAsandSolo 401(k)soffer high contribution limits with low costs and minimal administrative hassle.In 2025, individuals can contribute up to $23,500 to a solo 401(k). \u201cFor self-employed people, an individual 401(k) is often the most attractive option,\" saysJustin Pritchard, founder of Approach Financial. Solo 401(k)s allow you to choose between pretax and Rothcontributions, and even offer features like plan loans andmega backdoor Rothstrategies, Pritchard notes. For businesses with employees,SIMPLE IRAsand traditional 401(k)s are common. However, Diodato warns that SIMPLE IRAs have \"too low\" contribution limits for ambitious savers. Diodato often recommends SEP IRAs for their simplicity. As a business owner, you'll need to evaluate and weigh the flexibility, employee needs, and contribution goals to help pick the right fit for you. Without an exit plan, business owners risk having to sell in a rush\u2014or for less than their company is worth. \"Start early, ideally three to five years before exit,\" Stroup advises. Good exit planning includes determining a goodbusiness valuation, having a clearsuccessionor sale strategy, and considering your preferred timeline for retirement. \u201cA carefully planned exit strategy can maximize a business sale price, minimize tax frictions, and keep clients happy through a smooth and long-term transition period,\" says Diodato. Whether selling to employees, a competitor, or passing the business to family, early planning creates better outcomes and more peace of mind. If you have questions or need guidance, work with an expert to navigate your business exit. Selling a business and tapping retirement accounts are taxable events, but proactive planning can soften the tax blow. For example, spreading sale income over multiple years, usinginstallment sales, or structuring deals strategically can lower taxes, Diodato says. Stroup also recommends exploringlong-term capital gainstreatment orqualified small business stockexclusions where possible. After retirement, strategicRoth conversionsand tax-efficient withdrawals can help preserve more of your wealth. If you have atraditional individual retirement account (IRA), which hasrequired minimum distributions (RMD), take just that amount to limit your tax bill and to keep as much money as possible growing tax-deferred. Plus, work consider working with a financial advisor to iron out the specifics, like the best age to retire, when to start collecting yourSocial Securitybenefits (e.g., atfull retirement age, early, or at age 70) and how to avoid outliving your savings. Income spreadingis a common strategy that some high-income earners use to lower tax bills. If you sell a business and agree to an installment sale (meaning you receive at least one or more payments after the tax year in which the sale occurred), you might be able to spread the taxable income across multiple tax years instead of paying it all at once. Retiring when you own a business isn\u2019t just about selling at the right time, it\u2019s about planning carefully, saving wisely, and staying flexible. Starting building your personal retirement savings early, select the right retirement account, find an advisor your trust, and craft a clear exit strategy to help you to retire securely and confidently.",

        "content": "After working for decades and being disciplined about saving, your primary instinct may be to guard your growing wealth. But you don't want to take that impulse too far.Overprotecting wealthcan lead to the loss of some of the wealth that you're so eager to protect. \"At its core, wealth protection is about anticipating the biggest threats to yournest eggand addressing them in cost-effective ways,\" saidDouglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president ofBone Fide Wealth. For appropriate wealth protection, Boneparth recommends having the following: \"These strategies can feel especially appealing for those in or nearretirementwhen the shift from earning income to relying solely on their nest egg... Even those far from retirement may find a wealth protection strategy alluring during times ofmarket volatility,\" saidCarla Adams, a certified financial planner and founder ofAmetrine Wealth. If more than 75% of your assets are in cash or bonds with short maturities, this may indicate that you're overprotecting your wealth. Other indicators include multiple overlapping insurance riders such as over-insuring jewelry that you rarely wear, and steering clear of growth-oriented assets, Boneparth explained. Even young people in their 30s and 40s may find themselves overprotecting their wealth. \"Overprotecting is less of a concern for 30-somethings. But it still shows up in the form of sitting on too much cash, investing too conservatively, or carrying more insurance than necessary. Often this happens because they cross paths with an insurance salesperson eager to capitalize on their high-earning status, which is unfortunate, but true,\" saidPriya Malani, founder ofStash Wealth. Being too conservative with your investments can come at a cost, as you may be missing out on higher returns by not investing more of your money in high-growth assets like stocks. And overprotection taken to the extreme can hamper your retirement savings. Beware of high fees on annuities, which can erode your returns, and allocating too much of your portfolio towardsCDs,money market funds, and fixed income\u2014which can offer paltry interest rates in low interest rate environments. \"Holding excessive amounts of cash and/orbondsmay provide short-term peace of mind but in actuality can cause the portfolio to lose substantial value over time relative toinflation,\" said Adams. \"Annuities, which promise protection, come with high fees and limited upside potential, dampening portfolio growth.\" As Boneparth says, \"every dollar parked in an ultra-safe vehicle is a dollar not compounding in equities or other growth assets, over decades that difference can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" Rather than keep your money mostly in cash and bonds, diversify your portfolio so that it has the best opportunity for growth. You'll also want to periodicallyrebalanceyour portfolio to ensure that your investments still align with your financial goals. \"Building adiversified portfoliowith the right mix of bonds as well as stocks is key so that the bonds provide stability and modest growth while stocks allow for meaningful portfolio growth over the long term,\" Adams recommends. If you're younger, you likely want to have a higher allocation of your portfolio in equities, yet as you age, you may shift your portfolio more towards fixed-income. Additionally, try to only buy insurance policies that you need. For example, awhole life insurance policymay not be necessary if you have no dependents and are young and healthy. You want to avoid signing up for too many policies, as premiums can add up. \"We recommend carrying only essential insurance: health, disability, renters or homeowners, and auto,\" Malani says. \"You want to invest the rest in a diversified portfolio that aligns with your goals and timeline.\" Wanting to protect the wealth you've accumulated is a natural instinct. But you don't want to overprotect it and miss the opportunity to grow it further. You may be overprotecting your wealth if you have more than 75% of your money in cash or short-term bonds and unnecessary or overlapping insurance coverage. If you think that's you, try to strike a balance between capital preservation and growth by crafting a well-diversified investment portfolio. Additionally, avoid signing up for insurance policies that you don't really need.",

        "content": "You may see some price increases from tariffs in your recent shopping trips, but you won't see them in Wednesday's official report on inflation in April, forecasters say.A report on the Consumer Price Index by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday is likely to show the cost of living rose 2.3% over the 12 months ending in April, according to a survey of economists byDow Jones Newswiresand theWall Street Journal.That would be the lowest inflation since February 2021, before inflation flared in the wake of the pandemic. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs against U.S. trading partners are still likely to push up consumer prices, economists said. Merchants are expected to pass the cost of the import taxes on to consumers. However, since many of the tariffs announced so far weren't implemented until April, tariff inflation may not make much of a dent in official data for at least a few months. Some businesseshad stockpiled inventoryfrom abroad before the tariffs went into effect, giving them some financial breathing room to wait and see if the tariffs stay in place before adjusting their prices.\"Despite the actualization of tariffs, we do not expect April to be a light-switch moment in goods inflation,\" economists at Wells Fargo Securities wrote in a commentary.\"The pull-forward of imports, efforts not to alienate customers and general confusion over policy changes are likely to result in a more incremental strengthening in prices.\"Forecasters at Goldman Sachs said tariff price increases would likely hit in the three months following them going into effect, with other prices continuing to rise through the rest of the year as the effects ripple through the economy.As for April, price increases likely stayed relatively tame by most measures. \"Core\" inflation, which excludes volatile prices for food and energy, is expected to rise 2.8% over the year, the same as in March, according to the median forecast.",

        "header": "Congress's New Tax-Free Savings Proposal: Better Than a High-Yield Savings Account?",
        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. On May 1, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) introduced companion bills for a Universal Savings Account (USA) Act.The legislation proposes creating a new type of tax-advantaged account that would allow all Americans to put money in savings that can grow without being taxed. If that kind of tax benefit sounds familiar, you may be thinking of aRoth IRA, which lets you contribute a certain amount each year to a retirement fund where money grows tax-free. But unlike a Roth, which requires you to wait until age 59-1/2 to withdraw your funds without penalty, a USA would allow withdrawals at any time, no matter your age. The money you could put in a USA would be post-tax dollars, just like the money you put into a Roth IRA. That means you can't claim a tax deduction for your contribution. Instead, the tax break comes from not having your earnings taxed. As currently proposed, the contribution limit for a USA is larger than for a Roth. The USA Act indicates a maximum contribution in Year 1 of $10,000, to be increased $500 each year until reaching a maximum annual limit of $25,000.By contrast, the most you can put into a Roth IRA in 2025 is $7,000 (or $8,000 for those age 50 and older). In addition, the USA Act does not tie eligibility to any income limits. That differs from Roth IRA rules, which begin phasing out the eligibility to contribute once a single tax filer reaches amodified adjusted gross income (MAGI)of $150,000, or a married couple filing jointly has a MAGI of $236,000. So, how would a possible Universal Savings Account stack up against one oftoday's best high-yield savings accounts? As with many questions, the answer is that it depends. First, it depends on what you can earn with a USA. And second, yourtax bracketmatters. Let's say you can earn 4% with a standard high-yield savings account. The interest you earn from the bank or credit union would be taxed as regular income, meaning you'll get to keep something less than 4%. How much less is a factor of your tax bracket, which you can look up using the table below based on yourtaxable income. If you're in, say, the 22% tax bracket, you'll keep 78% of your interest earnings (100% minus your 22% tax rate). Multiplying 0.78 by 4% leaves you with a net interest rate of 3.12%. You can see all our calculations below for a starting taxable interest rate of 3% or 4%. Knowing these numbers allows you to see how much you'd have to earn in your USA in order to out-do a taxable high-yield savings account. If, for instance, you can only earn 2.00% in a USA, you'd be better off with a 3% taxable savings account that nets over 2%, unless you're in the 35% or 37% tax bracket. But if instead you can get close to the same rate with a USA as with a top high-yield savings account, or you are in a very high tax bracket, then a USA's tax savings will pay off. It comes down to doing the math on what yourafter-taxinterest rate will be for a standard account vs. your tax-free rate from a USA. You can likely benefit the most from a USA if you're able to sock away money each year and not touch it for a while, allowing you toinvestyour money for bigger gains. Like Roth IRAs, USAs would allow the purchase of stocks, bonds,ETFs, etc., allowing much larger gains over time. However, this type of investment is not recommended for funds you may want to access in the short term. Time will tell whether this proposed legislation passes, and whether Universal Savings Accounts will enter the marketplace and thetax code. In the meantime, it's always smart to make sure you're earning a competitive return on your money in the bank. We make that homework easy by publishing our national rankings of the highest bank deposit rates every business day. Right now, our daily ranking of thebest high-yield savings accountsincludes 15 accounts that pay between 4.35% and 5.00% APY, all with the flexibility to withdraw your funds whenever you want. In addition, you could commit a portion of your savings to acertificate of deposit (CD). The advantage of a CD is that your return is locked in for the duration of the CD, while savings account rates can drop at any time. Say you open a 1-year CD today that earns 4.50%, which is the top rate in our ranking of thebest nationwide CDs. That means that, no matter what happens to broader U.S. interest rates over the next year, your return of 4.50% will be guaranteed until next May. TheFederal Reserveopted this week to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, its third rate pause this year. But financial markets have priced in majority odds of three Fed rate cuts by year's end, which would push savings and CD rates lower. We update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available: Note that the \"top rates\" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.
