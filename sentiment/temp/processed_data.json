        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) shares will be on investors\u2019 radar screen after legendary investor Warren Buffett said on Saturday at theconglomerate's annual meetingthat heplans to step down as CEO at the end of this year. The 94-year-old Buffett, who has headed the company for 60 years, said he will hand over the reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who has long been identified by Berkshire as Buffett's successor. Buffett\u2019s retirement marks the end of an era that has cemented his place as an investment icon and American success story aftertransforming a faltering textile company into a trillion dollar conglomeratewith successful businesses across many sectors. Berkshire shares climbed to a fresh record high on Friday before Buffett\u2019s announcement on Saturday. As of last week's close, the stock has gained 19% since the start of the year and trades 35% higher over the past 12 months. By comparison, the benchmarkS&P 500has lost 3% and added 11%, respectively, over the same periods. Below, we take a closer look at thetechnicalson Berkshire\u2019s chart and identify key price levels investors will likely be watching. Berkshire shares broke out above the upper trendline of anascending trianglein Friday\u2019s trading session, potentially setting the stage for acontinuationmove higher. Meanwhile, therelative strength index (RSI)confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 50 threshold, though the indicator sits belowoverboughtlevels, providing ample room for the stock to trend higher. Let\u2019s apply severaltechnical analysistechniques to Berkshire\u2019s chart helping us identify key overhead areas worth watching, while also locating two crucialsupport levelsthat could come into play during futurepullbacks. To project an upside target using the measured move technique, we calculate the distance between the ascending triangle\u2019s two trendlines near the start of the pattern and add that amount to Friday\u2019sbreakoutpoint. Therefore, we add $50 to $535, which forecasts a target of $585, about 8% above Friday\u2019s closing price. Investors can also use the bars pattern tool to project abullishtarget. When applying the technique to Berkshire\u2019s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock\u2019s trend higher from early February to late March and reposition them from Friday\u2019s breakout point. This projects a target of around $606, around 12% above of Friday\u2019s close. We selected this prior move higher as it followed a breakout from an earlier ascending triangle on the chart, providing insight into how a similar uptrend may play out ifprice actionrhymes. A close below the ascending triangle\u2019s top trendline could trigger an initial pullback in the stock to around $519. This area on the chart may provide support near the prominent early-Marchpeakand a period of trading activity that formed within the pattern. Finally, a more significantretracementcould see Berkshire shares revisit lower support at $490. Investors may seek entry points in this region near the notable early-Marchswing lowduring a dip toward the50-day moving average.

        "header": "2 Tech Stocks With 47% or More Upside, According to Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The technology sector has produced some of the most rewarding growth stocks over the past four decades, andartificial intelligence (AI)promises to breed more wealth-building opportunities for investors. The recent market sell-off sent shares of top tech stocks tumbling, but Wall Street analysts still have a buy rating on two high-growth companies,Nvidia(NVDA2.33%)andThe Trade Desk(TTD1.81%). The consensusprice targeton these stocks suggests there could be significant upside from their discounted share prices. Here's why Wall Street might be on the money with these top tech stocks. Teaching computers to think for themselves requires powerfulgraphics processing units (GPUs). The demand for these chips has fueled impressive growth for a leading GPU designer, Nvidia. The average price target on Wall Street is currently 47% above Nvidia's current $111 share price. Nvidia's revenue more than doubled last year to $130 billion, with sales to data centers making up 88% of that total. The consensus analyst estimate expects the company's revenue to climb to over $200 billion this year, driven by demand for new data center chips. Demand for Nvidia's Blackwell computing system, which is designed for the most advanced AI workloads, is expected to be the main growth driver this year. \"We've successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in the fiscal Q4 earnings report. Image source: Nvidia. Still, not every analyst on Wall Street is bullish. The chip industry is historically cyclical. Nvidia is highly dependent on large data center operators continuing to spend massive amounts of money on technology infrastructure, including buying more GPUs to power their servers. The uncertainty with the economy and concerns that data center operators will look for more cost-efficient ways to invest in AI infrastructure have sent Nvidia shares down this year. But there's still no replacement for the computing power of Nvidia's GPUs. Two of Nvidia's largest customers,MicrosoftandAlphabet's Google, just revealed in their first-quarter earnings reports that they plan to continue spending heavily on data center infrastructure this year, which is good news for Nvidia. Given the continued investment in data centers, it's possibleNvidia sharescould hit Wall Street's price target within the next year with still bigger gains to come over the long term. The stock trades at a reasonable 25 times this year's earnings estimate, which could support near-term upside for the shares. The Trade Desk is a leading digital ad-buying platform that has delivered a nearly 1,700% return to investors since 2016. Despite a rare revenue miss for the company last quarter, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on its prospects with the average price target currently 64% above the current $53 share price. The Trade Desk continued to outperform the growth of the digital ad market last quarter. It reported a 26% year-over-year increase in revenue, which it earns from charging a fee on ad spending and other services on its platform. This fee-based model is driving significant growth in profitability and cash flow, too. However, revenue fell short of investor expectations, which triggered a sharp sell-off in the stock. Tariffs and the impact on the economy could lead to a soft ad market that could slow the company's growth, but the stock's recent correction seems to already reflect that possibility. The important question is, what's beyond 2025 for The Trade Desk? The Trade Desk estimates its addressable market at $1 trillion. Total ad spending on its platform totaled just $12 billion in the last quarter, so it's got a long runway ahead. It's investing in AI to make its service even better. Its Kokai AI platform can help ad buyers simplify the process of finding the right ads to show an audience. Management expects all of its customers to be using Kokai by the end of 2025. With such a huge opportunity still ahead, the stock could be a compelling buy at these lower share prices. Current Wall Street estimates have revenue growing 17% for 2025, while improving margins set the stage for robustearningsgrowth in the coming years that could fuel significant returns for investors. It's difficult to say whether the stock will hit the Street's price target this year, given the uncertainty in the ad market. But the stock was expensive heading into 2025, and it's now priced at a fair 30 times this year's earnings projection. This could be as cheap as the stock gets, giving long-term investors a great opportunity to buy a top growth stock on sale.",

        "header": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 4 Years?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA2.33%)has been the must-own stock for the artificial intelligence (AI) race. However, it sold off a fair bit over the past few months alongside the rest of the market. Currently, it sits around 25% to 30% down from its all-time high, trading at levels last seen during the late summer of 2024. It's not often that a sale price comes around on a big-time winner like this, but today's sale price only really matters if Nvidia is still heading in the right direction a few years from now. So, where will Nvidia be in four years? The answer may surprise you. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)drive the company. Originally designed for processing gaming graphics, GPUs soon found many alternative uses. Due to their unique ability to process multiple calculations in parallel, they are useful for any task that requires intense computing power, such as training and running an AI model. Nvidia isn't the only company making GPUs, but it dominates the market. Most estimates peg Nvidia's data center GPU market share above 90%, which is very impressive. However, with that kind of market share dominance, it invites other players to the industry, as Nvidia is making a ton of money from its GPUs. Nvidia's profit marginshave skyrocketed since the start of the AI race, and some of its clients are getting fed up with the price they must pay for Nvidia GPUs. So, they're starting to look for alternatives.  NVDA Profit Margindata byYCharts. One area that many of the AI hyperscalers are looking toward is custom AI accelerators, such as those designed byBroadcom(AVGO3.17%). These units are tailored to process one type of workload and can outperform Nvidia GPUs in certain applications, such as training and running AI models. However, they are tailored for a specific workload, making them inflexible to run others. This likely isn't a big deal, as many of the AI hyperscalers already know how they want their AI workloads to run. As a result, Nvidia could see some competition coming its way, but it likely won't be enough to dethrone Nvidia as an investment. The biggest factor for Nvidia investors is understanding where data center capital expenditures are going. If this spending falls off a cliff, Nvidia's revenue will follow. However, using outside data, Nvidia projects that data center capital expenditures will rise from around $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia has generated $115 billion from its data center division. If that $400 billion figure is true for 2024, that means it captured just shy of 30% of total data center spending. Should data center capital expenditures expand to the $1 trillion mark and Nvidia keepallof its market share, it would generate around $288 billion. That's monster growth, but Nvidia may not be able to capture all of it due to rising competition from custom AI accelerators. Broadcom estimates that the addressable market will be between $60 billion and $90 billion from three major clients alone by 2027. That's about a third of Nvidia's projected 2028 revenue (if it captures all of it), so it's safe to say that Broadcom is targeting Nvidia's market share. So, is Nvidia doomed over the next few years? I'd say no. The future will likely be a combination of GPUs and custom AI accelerators, meaning stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom will be successful investments. Will Nvidia have the rocket-ship growth it once did? Likely not. But it will likely still put up strong double-digit growth, making it a great candidate for a stock that can beat the market moving forward, especially if you canscoop up shares on sale right now. However, if the data center market doesn't reach that projected figure, Nvidia's stock may struggle to rise, as its overall revenue may be capped and under pressure as competition rises.",

        "header": "Wall Street Analysts Like These AI Stocks in 2025. Should You Buy Them?",
        "content": "In a year of uncertainty for the economy, leading companies inartificial intelligence (AI)are standing out. Wall Street analysts recently made bullish calls onBroadcom(AVGO3.17%)andServiceNow(NOW2.00%). One thing that stands out at first glance with these stocks is their expensive valuations. Both stocks trade at high multiples of their earnings and cash flow that could limit near-term upside. Let's see why these stocks may or may not justify their premiums. Image source: Getty Images. Broadcom supplies essential networking and other components for data centers. It benefits enormously from the investment pouring into AI infrastructure right now. After falling to a low of $146.29 this year, the stock has rebounded sharply in recent weeks to around $200, with the averageWall Streetanalyst still rating the stock a buy. As AI workloads increase in the data center, it puts more stringent requirements on advanced computing hardware, particularly the need for high-speed data transfer. Broadcom is meeting this demand. Its revenue grew 25% year over year last quarter to nearly $15 billion, with AI-related revenue surging 77% to $4.1 billion. Broadcom also supplies AI chip solutions for data centers, which are in high demand partly due to the short supply and high costs ofNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Broadcom sees AI chip revenue reaching $4.4 billion in fiscal Q2. It's for this reason that Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg recently rated Broadcom shares a buy, while recommending investors sell Nvidia. However, investors shouldn't overlook the stock's high valuation.Broadcom stocktrades at 97 times trailing earnings and 30 times this year's earnings estimate. Broadcom's earnings multiple is toward the high end of its previous trading range, suggesting it might be overvalued. Even for a company expected to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 20% in the next few years, Broadcom is priced at a premium. Most analysts are still bullish on Nvidia due to its recent momentum and competitive position in the GPU market. By comparison, the consensus analyst estimate still has Nvidia's earnings growing at an annual rate of 35% in the coming years, yet its shares trade at a more reasonable 25times forward earnings. Thechip industryis historically cyclical and can experience periods of slower demand during economic recessions. With a lot of uncertainty for the economy this year, investors should be careful before paying a higher earnings multiple for Broadcom. It could face relatively more downside risk if the chip industry's growth stalls in the near term. ServiceNow could be a huge beneficiary of future spending on AI-powered software that helps companies speed up workflow. The Wall Street consensus is high on its prospects and rates the stock a buy. ServiceNow sees the addressable market for its software reaching $275 billion by 2026. Subscription revenue grew 19% year over year in the first quarter, with remaining performance obligations up 25% to $22.1 billion. Management is seeing strong demand from companies looking to increase efficiency. It sees a growing opportunity in the federal sector, as the U.S. government seeks more cost-efficient solutions in technology. Overall, ServiceNow AI products saw a significant acceleration in demand to start the year, and management's guidance calls for 2025 revenue to increase approximately 19% over last year. Bank of Americaanalyst Brad Sills noted the company's solid execution and strong demand for its workflow automation platform amid uncertainty in the economy. He rates the shares a buy and recently raised the firm's price target to $1,085. ServiceNow stock is trading at a high valuation of 59 times forward earnings. But companies that generate recurring revenue from subscriptions generally trade at higher earnings multiples. On afree-cash-flow basis, ServiceNow shares trade at a multiple of 56, which is close to the middle of its previous five-year trading range. This leading AI software provider seems to offer a more reasonable value for long-term investors. There's still downside risk if a soft economy leads to lower software spending. But analysts expect the company's earnings to grow nearly 30% annually in the coming years. The recurring revenue business model along with a large market opportunity for its products is likely going to provide support for ServiceNow stock in the near term and set the stage for more returns in the coming years.",

        "content": "Turning $10,000 into $1 million is every investor's dream. That's a 100-times return on your investment, and it could be the very thing investors need to meet all their retirement goals. However, this kind of return in that timeframe is extremely rare. Only a handful of stocks have ever accomplished this feat. Nvidia(NVDA2.33%)has been a strong stock to own over the past few years, but there's still a ton of growth left in the AI market. Is there enough for a $10,000 investment to turn into $1 million a decade? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia is actually one of those stocks that turned $10,000 into $1 million in a decade. Even with the stock well off its all-time highs, if you invested $10,000 in Nvidia a decade ago, it would be worth around $2 million today. Unfortunately, investors don't have a time machine to go back and invest in Nvidia, so all that's left is looking forward. So, could Nvidia turn $10,000 into $1 million again? Likely not. For that to happen, Nvidia's value would need to rise 100 times, turning Nvidia from a $2.66 trillion company to a $266 trillion company. For reference, the entire U.S. stock market cap was around $62 trillion at the end of 2024. It's expected to reach around $128 trillion worldwide by the end of 2025. So, it's pretty evident that a $266 trillion company isn't going to appear a decade from now. But is a $10,000 investment in Nvidia still a smart one? I think so. You don't have to look for moonshot returns to be a successful investor; you just need to beat the market by a few percentage points each year. I think Nvidia can accomplish that, as there is still a ton of AI growth left. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)are best in class and have a greater than 90% market share in data centers. Few companies reach that level of dominance, but this just speaks to how successful a company Nvidia has been. While data center buildouts have been massive over the past few years, they're nothing compared to where Nvidia thinks they're headed. In 2024, they estimated that data center capital expenditures were around $400 billion. However, Nvidia expects that number to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. That's monster growth in a four-year timeframe, and if Nvidia maintains its market share, it could see similar growth in its already impressive financials. However, the market is worried that this data center spending could come under pressure if a trade war ramps up. This notion has been disproven, at least in the short term. Nvidia's biggest clients are AI hyperscalers likeAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Both of these companies affirmed commitments to massive capital expenditures over the next year, mostly focusing on data centers to power AI. This means that Nvidia's growth is full steam ahead, but the market values the stock as if that's not the case.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. At25 times forward earningsand 37 times trailing earnings, Nvidia is now valued at similar levels to its tech peers, such asApple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which trades at 34 times trailing earnings and 29 times forward earnings, despite not having nearly the same growth potential as Nvidia. Furthermore, Nvidia isn't that much more expensive than the broader market, as measured by theS&P 500(^GSPC1.47%), which trades at 20.5 times forward earnings. Nvidia still has a ton of growth left in the tank, even if the market isn't valuing it that way. While it won't turn $10,000 into $1 million, market-beating returns aren't out of the question,which makes Nvidia a great stock to scoop up today.",

        "content": "Wendy's (WEN) stock got an upgrade from JPMorgan analysts on Monday, but the upgrade also came with a lowered price target as analysts are staying cautious on an uncertain fast-food industry. Last week, Wendy'sand burger-makingrival McDonald's(MCD) reported weaker first-quarter sales than analysts had expected. McDonald'ssaid it has seen economic pressures spreadfrom low- to middle-income consumers, and Wendy's said it could see sales decline rather than grow in 2025. JPMorgan analysts upgraded Wendy's stock to \"overweight\" from \"neutral\" on Monday, but said they now expect the stock to reach $15 by the end of 2026, rather than $17 previously. The analysts are slightly more bullish than average on Wendy's stock, which has a consensus price target of about $14, according to Visible Alpha data. The target, above Wendy's Friday close of $12.55, comes as analysts are divided on how to rate the stock with two \"buy,\" four \"hold,\" and three \"sell\" ratings. Wendy's current price \"provides a value-oriented opportunity as we see significant upside,\" JPMorgan analysts said, adding the fast-food giant has room to improve itsfree cash flowwith a \"higher focus on franchise accountability,\" and grow its international footprint. However, the analysts noted a 2% decline in fast-food traffic compared to the last several quarters and pre-pandemic levels as a reason to be cautious. Wendy's shares were up 3% in early trading Monday. Still, they've lost about a fifth of their value since the start of the year.",

        "content": "Shares ofBroadcom(AVGO-1.43%)were bucking the broader trend in the market last month as a well-timed buyback announcement, generally positive analyst research, and a new product announcement lifted the stock. According to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished the month up 15%. As you can see from the chart below, Broadcom got a lift from theshare buybackannouncement at the beginning of the month and then tracked similarly to theS&P 500for the duration of April but with greater upside.  AVGOdata byYCharts Like the rest of the stock market, Broadcom shares dove in response to the Trump tariffs announcement. However, the stock rebounded quickly after the company delighted investors by announcing a $10 billion share repurchase program on April 7. While that represents only about 1% of the company's market cap, it represented a sign of confidence from management in the face of the uncertainty around the trade war and showed that it was eager to take advantage of any discount in the stock price. Broadcom stock jumped 5.4% on April 7 as a result, even as the broad market fell again. On April 9, it surged 19% on news that President Trump was announcing a 90-day pause on most of the \"reciprocal tariffs\" he had declared the week before. As a cyclical stock sensitive to the global economy, Broadcom was able to outperform the market on that news. Later in the month, the company announced an advancement in its Symantec cybersecurity business with Incident Protection, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that predicts cyberattacker behavior. Finally, Broadcom benefited from an upswing at the end of the month as fears about the trade war tamped down on news reports that the U.S. and China were open to trade talks. On April 30, Seaport Research initiated coverage of the stock with a buy, noting that Broadcom was well positioned to benefit from the hyperscalers' intentions to design their own chips, as it's considered a leader in custom ASIC chips, which the big cloud companies are turning to as a potential replacement for someNvidiaGPUs. Image source: Getty Images. Broadcom won't report its next earnings results until June, but the company seems well positioned to benefit from the tailwind in AI and ride out any broader market turmoil, thanks in part to its diversification across networking chips, infrastructure products, virtualization software, and cybersecurity. The chip giant looks like a good bet to continue to outperform the market, especially as its AI business appears to be gaining momentum.",

        "header": "Got $100? 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Semiconductor Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "It's been a rough year for semiconductor stocks so far. As of market close on April 30, theVanEck Semiconductor ETFhas fallen by 13%. To put that into perspective, this is more than double the losses witnessed in theS&P 500so far this year. Among one of the more notable laggards in the semiconductor space this year isNvidia, which has seen its market value drop by nearly $1 trillion. Indeed, the rare dip in Nvidia stock presents a tempting opportunity for growth investors right now. However, there's another name in the chip realm that I think is going overlooked. Let's dig into the entire operation atAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.84%). At just $100 a share, could AMD stock be your next winning ticket in theartificial intelligence (AI)revolution? In financial analysis, looking at the aggregate totals for revenue and profit often doesn't tell the entire story around a business. Take AMD as a prime example. In 2024, AMD's revenue and net income increased by 14% and 92%, respectively. Although these figures are impressive, they also don't really tell you a whole lot. Furthermore, most investors might simply compare these figures to Nvidia and determine that AMD is an inferior competitor given its smaller size and less robust growth. Savvy investors understand that there's more to the picture. By taking a look at some of the more nuanced details around AMD, investors may come to see that the company is actually beginning togive Nvidia a run for its money. AMD breaks its revenue and operating income into four buckets: data center, client, gaming, and embedded. In 2024, the data center and client segments stole the show. The data center business is particularly important, as this represents AMD's graphics processing unit (GPU) operation that competes directly against Nvidia. Moreover, the client segment includes sales from personal computers (PCs) and electronic devices -- which can serve as a proxy to help gauge AMD's chipset business outside of data centers. Last year, revenue from the data center business grew by 94% year over year to $12.6 billion while operating income surged by 175% to $3.5 billion. The client segment rose by more than 5% year over year to $7 billion in revenue, and transitioned from an operating loss in 2023 to a profit of $897 million. Clearly, these figures are much higher than the 14% revenue growth I referenced above. Unfortunately, AMD's gaming and embedded segments decelerated by 58% and 33%, respectively, last year. The declining sales and shrinking operating profits from gaming and embedded are essentiallyskewing the overall picture at AMD. Image source: Getty Images. While Nvidia still remains king of the AI chip realm, I would not sleep on the pace at which AMD is moving and its potential over the next several years. Over the last year or so, several behemoths in the AI space -- many of which are Nvidia customers -- have expressed interest in complementing their Nvidia infrastructure with alternative providers. Some examples includeOracle,Meta Platforms, andMicrosoft-- each of which is training various AI applications on AMD's MI300 accelerators in addition to using Nvidia chipsets. As AMD continues releasingnext-generation GPU architecturescombined with custom silicon solutions from cloud hyperscalers, I think AMD is in a position to force Nvidia's hand when it comes to price as GPUs are likely going to experience somecommoditizationin the coming years. Right now, AMD stock trades at aforward price-to-earnings(P/E) ratio of 22.4 -- nominally below that of Nvidia. To add another layer to this analysis, take for instance the valuation disparity between AMD and Nvidia.  AMD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts As of this writing, Nvidia boasts a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion. By comparison, AMD's market cap is $160 billion. While Nvidia is a much larger company than AMD in terms of revenue and profitability, I question whether its valuation should be 17 times that of AMD. AMD is already proving that it can work with some of Nvidia's largest existing customers, and do so in a highly profitable manner. Furthermore, the financial and customer profiles explored above underscore that AMD is still in the middle of scaling its data center GPU operation, suggesting the company is positioning itself for more growth ahead. In my eyes, investors are too hung up on AMD's overall growth andnot attributing enough of a premium to the trends in the data center business. For just $100, investors can buy into AMD at a valuation of $160 billion -- a steep discount to the next closest competitor (Nvidia) all while enjoying long-run tailwinds fueling the AI infrastructure movement. I think AMD is positioned to thrive over the next several years and see the stock as a downright bargain at its current price point.",

More recently, the stock\u2019s price has rallied from the lower range of the pattern but remains below both the 50- and200-day moving averages, which formed an ominousdeath crosslast month.

        "content": "Earnings have been strong. Not everyone\u2019s happy about it. Nearly three-quarters of S&P 500 companies had turned in first-quarter results through Friday, according to FactSet, which in a note last week said that earnings for the index as a whole are on track\u2014based on a \u201cblended\u201d number that reflects numbers already reported and Wall Street\u2019s expectations for those that remain\u2014to rise nearly 13% year-over-year. Still, some investors are wary. Investors have so far bid up shares of companies that have reported guidance better than the Street expected, according to Bank of America research, but companies have been rewarded less than is typical for stronger-than-expected results, and misses have been more harshly punished than in recent years. The percentage of companies beating earnings estimates, meanwhile, is higher than the historical average, but that of sales beats is lower, Bank of America said. Many companies are withdrawing forecasts entirely. One of the latest examples came today: engine maker Cummins (CMI),which cited uncertaintyabout the direction of Trump administration trade policy. (Other companies have taken another tack, offering up outlooks that take into account arange of economic scenarios.) \u201cCompanies are getting nervous about the future\u2014so much so that they\u2019re pulling earnings forecasts in droves,\u201d wrote Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, in a Monday email. Even those that aren\u2019t withdrawing forecasts are being cautious, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote last week, while observing that an above-average share of companies that have offered full-year guidance have kept previously issued numbers in place. \u201cWe view this dynamic partly as a reflection of [companies\u2019] hesitancy to shift guidance due to uncertainty around tariff policy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFor example, some companies noted in their earnings calls that their most recent guidance does not incorporate the impact of tariffs.\u201d That could spell trouble in the months ahead, especially if companies are spending now to get ahead of the effects of tariffs later. \u201cIn our reading, a combination of pre-buying and inventory rundowns should give companies a buffer of about 1 to 2 months before the tariff impacts start to bite,\u201d Deutsche Bank analysts wrote last week.\"If sustained, we see the potential impact of the announced tariffs as large and likely to fall disproportionately on US companies.\u201d The bulk of theMagnificent Seven's results are in, with only Nvidia's (NVDA) remaining. But plenty of closely watched reports areexpected this week, among them numbers from Palantir (PLTR), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Walt Disney (DIS) and Coinbase Global (COIN).",

        "content": "Is it possible to make $500,000 to support you throughout your retirement? Yes, but it takes some careful planning, adjustments, and smart investing moves. Start by establishing how much you will be spending each year of your retirement. It\u2019s time tomake a budget. So, add together all your expectedexpenses. According toCarla Adams, financial advisor and founder of Ametrine Wealth, most people will need to replace approximately 70% of their income after they retire. The percentage isn\u2019t closer to 100% because once you retire, you may be able to stop saving for retirement, and taxes are often lower for retirees. \u201cAnd many people end up paying off theirmortgagearound the time they retire, so that expense goes away,\u201d says Adams. So your annual expenses have changed, but you also need to look at your income sources. Don\u2019t forget to include yourSocial Security benefits, any annuities, stock dividends you expect, and the pension you may have from a former employer. \u201cPensions, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one, are wonderful, because the more income you have, the less you have to withdraw from your portfolio for retirement. Social Security and pensions are also guaranteed for life, unlike your investment portfolio,\u201d Adams says. When withdrawing money from your retirement savings, most advisors would say it is wise to follow the4% rule. According to this rule, you should be able to withdraw 4% of your retirement savings balance in the first year after you retire. Then adjust for inflation and withdraw the same dollar amount every year thereafter for approximately 30 years. \u201cThis is based on a 65-year-old having a portfolio that is 60%stocksand 40% bonds that gives an annual average return of about 7%,\u201d says Adams. \u201cIf you have a $500,000 portfolio, then, per the 4% rule, you can safely withdraw about $20,000 per year.\u201d However, not everyone agrees that this is the perfect percentage. Thecreator of the rule, William P. Bengen, thinks 5% could be a better rule for all, while others caution that a 3% rule might be safer. Talk to a financial advisor about your particular situation. You may need to take smaller withdrawals during down markets to avoid asequence of returns risk. This can happen when your portfolio experiences a major loss because of a market downturn early in retirement. It can mean less money in your savings in future years. \u201cIt can shrink your portfolio much faster than expected,\u201d saysDaniel Milks, a certified financial planner and founder of Fiduciary Organization. \u201cIn down years, reducing withdrawals or tappingcash reservescan help protect against this risk.\u201d In addition to turning to cash, to mitigate this problem, ensure your portfolio is reviewed regularly and welldiversifiedacross different asset classes to reduce the impact of any single asset's performance. Your financial advisor might also suggest a phased retirement where your transition happens more gradually. Having a part-time job is a great way to supplement your income during retirement. Even a few thousand a year can make a difference and allow you to withdraw less from yourretirement savings. \u201cWorking part-time in retirement can make a lot of sense for those who are concerned about spending through their portfolio before the end of their lifetime,\u201d Adams says. \u201cEven if you only make, say, $10,000 per year working part-time in retirement, that\u2019s $10,000 less that you have to withdraw from your portfolio to cover yourcost of living, and that money can instead stay in your portfolio and continue to grow.\u201d Other forms of income, such as rental income, can also help to bolster your income during retirement. \u201cPart-time work, consulting, or rental income can all help stretch savings. They give retirees flexibility and reduce the pressure on their investment accounts, especially in uncertain markets,\u201d Milks says. The risk-return tradeoff states that as risk rises, so does the potential return. You want yourretirement portfolioto balance risk and still give you the return that you need during your retirement years. The further away from retirement you are, the more risky you can afford to be, but as you approach your next transition, you should consider becoming a bit more risk-averse. \u201cA balanced mix ofequitiesfor growth and bonds orcashfor stability works well,\u201d Milks says. \u201cI often suggest a \u2018bucket strategy\u2019\u2014short-term needs in cash, medium-term in bonds, and long-term growth in stocks.\u201d If there are shortfalls in your retirement budget, you\u2019ll want to look for ways to cut expenses. \u201cWe normally start with small cuts, such as downgrading a TV package, changing cellphone plans, or refinancing higher-interest debt,\u201d saysChris Diodato, a certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning. \u201cOnce those options are exhausted, we turn to larger cuts and ask questions about downsizing or living with only one car.\u201d Bigger shortfalls may call for bigger actions, such as downsizing, relocating to a more cost or tax-friendly location, or turning to home equity by considering a reverse mortgage. Choosing the rightfinancial plannercan help to steer your retirement plans in the right direction. \u201cWorking with a\u00a0fiduciary, fee-only financial planner is important because you get advice that\u2019s based solely on your best interests\u2014not on commissions or product sales. It helps you avoid emotional decisions and ensures you\u2019re following a strategy that\u2019s aligned with your goals,\u201d Milks says. Getting a written financial plan from a financial planner is also a smart move. \u201cHaving a formal, trackable plan makes it much easier to adjust course when markets shift or your life circumstances change,\u201d Milks says. To make$500,000 last in your retirement, you\u2019ll have to make some smart financial moves. Begin by estimating your annual expenses and income, such as money from a part-time job, Social Security benefits, and a pension. When withdrawing money from an investment portfolio, use the 4% rule and withdraw no more than 4% of your investments in a year. In down markets, reduce the money you withdraw from investments and use your cash reserves instead. Consider part-time work to supplement your income, especially if you are experiencing a shortfall in your retirement savings. Cutting both small and big expenses can help. For example, you may want to consider downsizing, going down to a single car, or moving to a place with a lower cost of living.",

        "content": "You work for your money\u2014and whatever you have left after paying the bills each month should work for you. Unfortunately, far too many of us just let our savings degrade. Not only do we earn next to no interest on them, but we allowinflationto erode their value year after year. Here are some smarter alternatives. A recent Vanguard study found that \"57% of survey respondents report that their savings are earning less than 3% interest, including 24% earning less than 1%.\" Typically, that means the money is sitting in a regular old savings or checking account at a bank. Inflation, as measured by theConsumer Price Index (CPI), is currently running at an annual rate of 2.4%. So anyone whose savings aren't earning at least that much is steadily losing ground. So what's a better way? Rachel Elson, a certified financial planner with Perigon Wealth Management in San Francisco, recommends that clients start by saving the equivalent of three to six months of expenses in a checking or savings account. That's theiremergency reserve. She suggests ahigh-yield savings accountwithFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)coverage for spending beyond a month or two. These accounts, often found at online banks, recently paid more than 4% in some cases, compared with an anemic average of 0.41% for savings accounts in general. Alternatively, a money market account, which is a hybrid between a checking and a savings account, often has a higherannual percentage yield (APY)than standard savings accounts. That means you could make easy withdrawals through checks, but you would likely get a lower return than on a high-yield savings account. After that, it depends on the goals you might have for your money, Elson says. Leaving the cash in the high-yield account might make sense if it's earmarked for a goal that's no more than 18 months out, like a vacation. It isn't going to lose money\u2014unlike, say, the stock market, which historically does well in the long haul but could easily lose value over any 18-month period. For the long term, a stock marketindex fundorexchange-traded fund (ETF)could be a good option. Other possibilities, Elson says, include increasing your contributions to your401(k)orHealth Savings Account (HSA)if you have one at work or funding aRoth individual retirement account (IRA)on your own. Roth IRAs have the added advantage that you can take your contributions (but not their earnings) out at any time, tax-free and for any purpose. While it's typically best to leave the money untouched until you eventually retire, it's nice to know that it's accessible in the meantime if you happen to need it. You have many options for your savings that will reward you more generously than a traditional bank account. The important thing, Elson says, is to consider your goals. \"You want to know what your money is working toward,\" she adds, \"and to make sure it's deployed in a useful way.\"",

We cover refinancing every business day, including thenational average refi ratefor all major loan types, as well asstate-by-state refi averages. The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Mortgage rates have not been spared from the market chaos triggered by President Trump's evolvingtariffpolicy. Though an initial stock market sell-off prompted a drop in 10-year Treasury yields, which in turn pushed mortgage rates lower, that trend reversed after just two days. Bond yields then soared,confounding many experts\u2014and unsurprisingly shooting mortgage rates higher. But 30-year mortgage rates changed direction again three Fridays ago\u2014and this last week held onto most of that decline. You can see the three-week change for each new purchase loan average below, followed by a deeper dive into 30-year, 15-year, and jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loans. Rates on 30-year new purchase loans have given up 19 basis points over the last three calendar weeks. That lowers the flagship average to 6.95%\u2014a notable improvement vs. the 7.14% average registered on April 11. Leading up to that reading, 30-year rates surged a remarkable 44 basis points, for their biggest Friday-to-Friday gain since June 2022 and their most expensive average in almost 11 months. Things were much better in September, when the 30-year average plunged to a two-year low of 5.89% (the cheapest Friday average being 6.03%). So far this year, the lowest weekly reading has been 6.55%. Every business day, we publishnational rate averages for various loan types, and alsoeach state's 30-year rate average. Right now, New York and Texas have the lowest 30-year rates. Rates on 15-year new purchase loanshave declined even more dramatically in the past three weeks, subtracting a bold 34 basis points to average 5.97% on Friday.Still, the current reading is a full percentage point above the two-year low of 4.97% registered in September. Rates on jumbo 30-year new purchase loans fell 25 basis points across three weeks, landing Friday at a 6.90% average. That's compared to a 2025 high of 7.15%. In contrast, September rates on new 30-year jumbo loans sank as far as 6.24%, with the lowest weekly average registering at 6.39%.

After trading higher for much of the session, the Dow ran out of steam in the afternoon to end with a loss of 0.2%, while the Nasdaq finished 0.7% lower. Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) shares plunged nearly 12%, easily losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday. The producer of orthopedic implants, known for its artificial knee and hip joints, reduced its earnings outlook for 2025, noting that tariffs could drag down operating profits by $60 million to $80 million over the full year. The company indicated that it is exploring options to mitigate the potential tariff impact, including possible shifts in the countries where it sources and manufactures its products. Meanwhile, the entertainment business became the latest industry to be caught in the trade-war crosshairs after Trump announced a100% tariff on foreign-made films. Although ON Semiconductor (ON) topped first-quarter profit estimates and essentially matched sales expectations, the power and sensing chipmaker's revenue fell 22% year-over-year, reflecting softness in automotive markets. The company noted that itfaces macroeconomic challengesand anticipated price declines in parts of its business. Onsemi shares fell 8.4%. Tyson Foods (TSN) reportedlower-than-expected salesfor its fiscal second quarter, and shares of the chicken, pork, and beef processor dropped 7.8%. Tyson pointed to a significant earnings impact from setting aside approximately $340 million related to the settlement of an antitrust investigation regarding alleged price-fixing in the pork industry. Although adjusted earnings per share for the period exceeded expectations, the company also provided relatively underwhelming full-year sales guidance. Shares of internet domain provider GoDaddy (GDDY) advanced 3.4%, securing the S&P 500's top daily performance. With Monday's gains, GoDaddy stock clawed back a portion of the steep losses posted Friday in the wake of the company's quarterly earnings release.

The company reported first-quarter revenue of $884 million, up 39% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus. Adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents, rose from 8 cents per share a year earlier, in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\u00a0Investors may have been looking for more, after the AI darling posted blowout results inFebruaryandNovember. Palantir shares tumbled close to 9% in after-hours trading. The stock was up over 63% for 2025 through Monday's close and nearly 400% over the past 12 months.

        "content": "Like much of the stock market, Nvidia(NVDA-0.64%)has experienced significant volatility in 2025. Even after recovering some of its losses, the stock remains down 15% year to date. Investors are concerned that President Donald Trump's tariffs could reduce demand for the company's data center chips, which are the best in the industry for developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Although semiconductors are exempt from the most aggressive tariff policies, many of Nvidia's customers still face increased costs and potential sales declines, which could force them to reduce their capital expenditures (capex). Meta Platforms(META0.34%),Microsoft(MSFT0.15%),Alphabet(GOOG0.14%)(GOOGL0.12%), andAmazon(AMZN-1.95%)are four of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's AI chips, and they just gave Nvidia investors a positive update on their planned AI spending for this year. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) was the industry's dominant AI data center chip throughout 2023 and for most of 2024. It was based on the company's Hopper architecture, which has been superseded by the higher-performing Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra architectures. In fact, the new Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU can performAI inferenceup to 50 times faster than the H100 in specific configurations, which is important for developers of next-generation \"reasoning\" models. Traditionallarge language models(LLMs) deliver one-shot responses, providing users with fast and convenient access to information, but they often make mistakes. Reasoning models spend more time \"thinking\" in the background to clear up as many errors as possible before generating a response. This means they make better use of the data they already have, which reducespre-trainingworkloads (endlessly feeding more data into models to make them \"smarter\"). But since reasoning models use up more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) during the thinking process and are slower to generate responses, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says they need up to 100 times more computing power than traditional models to maintain a convenient user experience. Blackwell Ultra chips (which will ship to customers in the second half of 2025) are a step in the right direction, but developers are already eyeing Nvidia's next-generation Rubin GPUs, which are expected to deliver afurther3.3 times more compute performance. Rubin GPUs will pave the way for the most powerful reasoning models to date, and they are slated for release in 2026. Simply put, Nvidia is investing heavily in innovation to continue driving theAI industryindustry forward for the long term, which is why investors are so anxious for proof that demand is holding up. Nvidia is an American company, but the majority of its chips are fabricated offshore byTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, so they are technically imported products. However, Trump exempted semiconductors from his \"Liberation Day\"tariffson imports, as he understands the importance of keeping the U.S. at the forefront of AI technology. The bigger concern is the effect of tariffs on Nvidia's customers. They are spending tens of billions of dollars per year on AI chips and data center infrastructure, so any slowdown in their core operations could force them to pull back. Tariffs apply to physical goods, so a company like Amazon will take a hit because it draws part of its revenue from its e-commerce platform, which imports retail products from other countries. However, Amazon's cloud services platform, digital advertising business, and streaming segment aren't directly subjected to tariffs because they offer digital products and services. Other Nvidia customers like Meta, Microsoft, andAlphabetalso primarily sell digital products and services, so they could weather the global trade tensions better than most companies. As a result, they each delivered reassuring news for Nvidia investors when they reported their financial results for the first quarter (ended March 31): The dip in Nvidia stock has created a fantastic buying opportunity for investors too. The stock currently trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 39, which is a significant discount to its 10-year average and median, both of which are above 50.  Data byYCharts. Nvidia generated $115.2 billion in data center revenue during its fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 26), which was an eye-popping 142% increase from the prior year. But Huang predicts that data center spending will top$1 trillion annually by 2028as reasoning models demand even more computing power, so the company still has a long potential growth runway. Data center operators like Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon typically plan their infrastructure spending years in advance, even if they only offer guidance for the coming 12 months. Therefore, they might be willing to look past any short-term slowdown in the economy from the tariffs and global trade tensions. That's likely why they haven't reduced their capex forecasts. Plus, demand for Nvidia's chips is outstripping supply, so companies can't afford to cancel orders because they would risk falling behind in the AI race. As a result, Nvidia stock looks like a great buy at the current price, especially for investors who arewilling to stay the course until 2028and beyond.",

        "content": "If you've looked at your retirement savings in dismay over the past month, you're not alone, according to a new survey. A survey released last week by financial services firm Voya showed that more than a third of respondents said tariffs and trade policy uncertainty have had a severe impact on their retirement savings.Nearly 40% of respondents also said they deferred or strongly considered delaying their planned retirement date during the recent tumult. The survey results highlight how retirement savers are reacting to recent market and economic volatility. Traders hopetrade deals are on the way, andstocks have recoupedmuch of theinitial losses incurredafter Trump announcedsteep duties on trading partners. However, concerns persist throughout financial markets about howimport taxes will affect the economy. Many retirement savers are making some changes to their investments. Nearly 30% report making changes to their employee-sponsored retirement plan or are strongly considering doing so, according to the survey. Nearly 20% of savers said they moved money from investments to traditional savings accounts, while roughly the same amount said they were strongly considering it. In times of uncertainty, it's important to have a plan in place for your retirement, said Kerry Sette, vice president and head of consumer insights and research at Voya. \u201cMarket volatility, policy changes, regulatory shifts, and fluctuating investor sentiment can create uncertainty, but maintaining a steady retirement savings and investment strategy is key,\" Sette toldInvestopedia. Financial advisors said that the strategy during volatility could differ depending on how close to retirement you are. Those who arecloser to retiringcould consider some changes, such asRoth IRA Conversionorrebalancing their 401(k)s, advisors said. Those further from retirement should be able toregain their savings over time. Either way, advisors said that retirement savers shouldn't drastically change their savings strategies during periods of uncertainty.",
