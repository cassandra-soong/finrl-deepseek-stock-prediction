        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be the hottest investing topic on Wall Street, and arguably no stock has performed likePalantir Technologieshas. The software company's growth has accelerated since it launched its proprietary AIP platform for AI applications in mid-2023. As a result, Palantir Technologies is up over 1,900% in just under two and a half years. It's often wise to lean into winning stocks, and Palantir'sartificial intelligence (AI)-driven opportunities could fuel growthfor the foreseeable future. However, trading at anenterprise value-to-sales ratio of nearly 100, Palantir's valuation has become egregiously steep. Therefore, it may be wise to forget about Palantir Technologies, for now, and consider a few other leading AI companies with promising growth opportunities and far more reasonable price tags. Image source: Getty Images. There is a massive and ongoing investment cycle as companies spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers to train and operate AI models.Nvidia(NVDA-0.99%)has emerged as the industry standard in AI chips, with some industry estimates pegging its market share at approximately 77% in 2025. Data center AI chips have become the majority of Nvidia's business today. That can be scary, but data centerinvestments have remained strong. The broader technology sector seems to be in a generational cycle as it lays the foundation for AI and what it could become over the coming years. Despite its stock price soaring in recent years, Nvidia trades at a reasonableprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 46. Meanwhile, analysts estimate the company will grow earnings by an average of 35% annually over the long term. That's compelling value for that anticipated growth, assuming Nvidia and AI sustain their momentum. One of Nvidia's largest customers is social media giantMeta Platforms(META-0.62%). CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the company leaning aggressively into AI. Meta has developed and open-sourced its AI model, Llama, which has garnered over 1 billion downloads. The company has integrated AI models into its social media apps to drive engagement and ad monetization. It sells electronic hardware, including virtual reality headsets and AI smart glasses. Meta Platforms is still in the early innings of its AI business ambitions. Reality Labs, the segment housing all of Meta's virtual reality and AI projects, still operates at a loss. Fortunately, the core business continues to thrive and drive growth. The company's social media apps, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, continue to grow. Total daily active users rose 6% year over year to 3.43 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Analysts estimate Meta Platforms will grow earnings by an average of over 17% annually over the long term. That growth makes the stock a strong buy at its current P/E ratio (25), assuming the company can meet those expectations. Since AI applications typically run on the cloud, it is a tremendous growth catalyst for cloud companies likeAmazon(AMZN-1.01%). The e-commerce giant happens to operate the world's leading cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is thecompany's largest profit center. In Q1 2025, Amazon's AWS revenue grew nearly 17% from a year ago to $29.2 billion. These tailwinds should continue for years to come. Research by Roots Analysis estimates the public cloud market could grow to $3.36 trillion by 2035, a 17.5% annualized growth rate over the next decade. As the market leader, Amazon should directly benefit from this. The recent tariff drama has kept the stock price down from its highs, but long-term investors could use this as a buying opportunity. The stock's current P/E ratio of 33 should set the path for strong investment returns if Amazon can grow earnings at a 19% annualized pace over the long term, as analysts predict.",

        "content": "D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) soared Tuesday after the companyannounced the release of a quantum computing systemit says can solve problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers. The company said its Advantage2 system increases energy scale by 40% and reduces noise by 75%, which results in higher-quality outputs for solving complex calculations. The company added that the technology marks a significant milestone not just for D-Wave, but for thequantum computingindustry as a whole. D-Wave shares jumped 26% to $16.56 on Tuesday. The stock has nearly doubled since the start of the year and gained more than 1,100% over the past 12 months,boosted by a 509% surge in the company\u2019s first quarter revenueand expectations that quantum computing will transform a wide range of industries.

Let\u2019s usetechnical analysisto forecast two potentialupsideprice targets to watch on D-Wave\u2019s chart and also identify a crucialsupport levelworth monitoring during future retracements. Investors can apply the measured move technique by calculating the percentage change from the low to high of the ascending triangle and adding it to the pattern\u2019s top trendline value. For example, we apply a 233.33% increase to $12, which projects a target of $40, a location on the chart where investors may decide tolock in profits. When applying the bars pattern tool to D-Wave\u2019s chart, we extract the stock\u2019s strongtrendingmove that immediately preceded the ascending triangle and overlay it from the recent breakout point. This analysis forecasts a more bullish upside target of around $90, representing a near six-fold increase from Tuesday\u2019s closing price. During retracements in D-Wave's stock, investors should closely monitor the $12 level. This area would likely attract strong support on apullbackto the ascending triangle\u2019s top trendline and a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to early 2021.

        "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures dropped on Wednesday, after a modest uptick in Treasury yields weighed on stocks in the previous session. Markets are looking ahead to fresh retail earnings, with investors keen for any insight into the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s punishing tariffs on prices. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang comments on U.S. curbs on artificial intelligence chip exports to China, while inflation in the U.K. surges. 1. Futures dip U.S. stock futures edged lower on Wednesday, pointing to an extension to a drop in equities in the prior session. By 03:18 ET (07:18 GMT), the Dow futures contract had slipped by 172 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures dropped by 29 points, or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 125 points, or 0.6%. The main averages on Wall Street retreated on Tuesday, as stocks were weighed down by 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which touched an intraday high before easing back to settle at around 4.48%. In a note to clients, analysts at UBS said this was an indication that a Moody\u2019s downgrade of its U.S. credit rating late last week did not come as a surprise \"as the worsening U.S. fiscal outlook is well known by investors\". \"Instead, markets are likely focused on the progress of ongoing trade negotiations as well as the \u2019one big, beautiful bill\u2019 [...] Trump is trying to push through,\" the brokerage noted. Trump went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to persuade Republican lawmakers to pass his massive budget bill, which some analysts have estimated could add between $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the U.S. government\u2019s $36.2 trillion debt load. At the end of the trading day, the benchmark S&P 500 had declined by 0.39%, snapping six-session winning streak. Home Depot(NYSE:HD) shares pared back earlier gains to finish lower, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u2019s stock inched up by 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk said he plans to be at the helm of the electric carmaker in five years. 2. Retail earnings ahead Investors will have the chance to parse through earnings from more retail chains on Wednesday, with the impact of Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff agenda in focus. Department store group TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) and home improvement firm Lowe\u2019s Companies (NYSE:LOW) are both due to deliver their results before the start of U.S. trading. The figures come against a backdrop of increased tariff tensions that have contributed to gloomy returns and forecasts from a host of consumer-facing companies. This includes big-box retail titan Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which warned last week of impending price hikes. On Tuesday, Home Depot said it would keep prices steady, although it flagged that the duties may cause some products to disappear from the do-it-yourself retailer\u2019s shelves. 3. Nvidia CEO on U.S. AI chip export controls Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday that U.S. export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips to China had failed to prevent Beijing\u2019s advancements in the industry, pushing businesses towards locally-developed processors. \u201cI think, all in all, the export control was a failure,\u201d Huang told reporters at Taiwan\u2019s Computex conference. \u201cThe export control gave [local companies] the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development.\u201d Huang also noted that Nvidia\u2019s market share in China has slumped to 50%, down from 95% at the start of former U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Biden oversaw a slew of restrictions on the export of crucial AI tech to China that Trump has largely maintained or even deepened. The U.S. Department of Commerce recently issued new guidance aimed at further restricting China\u2019s chip industry, with the agency stating that use of certain chips from Huawei violated U.S. export laws. 4. U.K. inflation surges U.K. inflation jumped sharply in April, hitting its highest level in over a year, potentially causing the Bank of England to delay any further interest rate cuts. Annual consumer price inflation rose 3.5% in March, above the 2.6% seen the prior month, and considerably above the U.K. central bank\u2019s 2.0% medium-term target. The monthly rate rose 1.2%, a steep uptick from the 0.3% seen in March. Analysts had expected the CPI to rise 3.3% on an annual basis, and 1.1% on the month. Core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose 1.4% on a monthly basis, with the annual rate at 3.8%. This acceleration in inflation came as the country faced a confluence of factors that are likely to drive up prices, including substantial hikes in energy and water bills, adjustments to vehicle excise duty, and rises to council taxes. 5. Oil rises Oil prices surged higher following reports Israel is preparing a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, raising fears supply could be hit from this key Middle East producing region. At 03:22 ET, Brent futures soared 1.1% to $66.08 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1.2% to $62.77 a barrel. Israel is preparing for a potential military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, as the U.S. continues to pursue a diplomatic agreement with Tehran, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing multiple U.S. officials familiar with recent intelligence. The report said that the Israeli leaders have not made a final decision yet, but the likelihood of an Israeli strike has \"gone up significantly\" in recent months. Additionally, U.S. crude stockpiles increased by approximately 2.5 million barrels for the week ending May 16, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday, defying forecasts for a 1.9 million-barrel draw.

        "header": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. CoreWeave",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is booming, presenting great investment opportunities. Two prominent AI businesses to consider investing in are newcomerCoreWeave(CRWV3.95%), which had its initial public offering (IPO) on March 28, and veteranNvidia(NVDA-0.99%). Nvidia has a long history of success stretching back to the creation of its famed graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999. CoreWeave offerscloud computinginfrastructure tailored for AI, and when it went public, Nvidia bought shares. Does the up-and-coming CoreWeave have what it takes to make a good AI investment for the long haul? Or is tried-and-true Nvidia a safer choice in the competitive AI market? Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia became an AI juggernaut thanks to its popular GPUs. This hardware enables computers to process data faster and more efficiently than a traditional CPU, and was initially developed for video game graphics. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's prescient founder and CEO, recognized years ago that GPUs could be applied to AI. Now, he believes cloud computing will become akin to factories in the Industrial Revolution to deliver economies of scale for AI. As part of this vision, he explained in a press release, \"AI, like electricity and internet, is essential infrastructure for every nation.\" That's why Nvidia is helping countries, such as Saudi Arabia, construct AI factories. On top of that, the company introduced its powerful Blackwell Ultra platform this year. Blackwell Ultra shifts AI systems toward mimicking human thinking, such as drawing conclusions from data. This marks the AI sector's move into what's referred to as the age of AI reasoning. These developments set Nvidia up for growth over the long run. Its AI success has already translated into a record $39.3 billion in sales in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Jan. 26, representing 78% year-over-year growth. Moreover, fiscal Q4net incomerose 80% year over year to $22.1 billion. Nvidia forecasts sales will accelerate to $43 billion in Q1, a 65% increase over the prior year's $26 billion. CoreWeave's cloud computing services employ Nvidia's GPUs, and it contracts with companies hungry to utilize that computing power. As a newly public business, CoreWeave has only its first-quarter earnings report under its belt, but those Q1 results were outstanding. Revenue rose 420% year over year to $981.6 million. Its performance was thanks to CoreWeave's success in acquiring customers. Clients include AI luminaries such asMicrosoft,IBM, and OpenAI. At the end of Q1, the company's contracts represented an impressive revenue backlog of $25.9 billion. CoreWeave already added to this haul in Q2 thanks to a $4 billion contract expansion with one of its customers. In addition, while President Donald Trump'stariff policiesintroduced economic uncertainty, CoreWeave isn't seeing an effect. About the tariffs, CFO Nitin Agrawal stated on the recent earnings call: \"We haven't observed any impact on customer behavior. In fact, we are seeing an acceleration of customer demand.\" As a result, the company estimates Q2 sales of about $1.1 billion, up from $395 million in 2024. For the full year, CoreWeave projects 2025 revenue of at least 4.9 billion compared to last year's $1.9 billion. Despite the massive sales growth, CoreWeave is not profitable. The company exited Q1 with a net loss of $314.6 million. This is more than a 100% increase from the prior year's net loss of $129.2 million as the company invested in expanding its AI infrastructure to keep up with customer demand. When it comes to picking an AI stock, plenty of reasons exist to choose Nvidia over CoreWeave. After all, Nvidia has years of business growth behind it, and possesses industry-leading AI tech that even CoreWeave is buying. But one factor to consider is valuation. Here's a look at the forwardprice-to-sales(P/S) ratio for both companies. This metric measures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of revenue based on estimates for the next 12 months.  Data byYCharts. Nvidia's forward P/S ratio dropped this year as the aforementioned economic uncertainty, and the appearance of ChineseAI start-up DeepSeekon Jan. 27, rattled Wall Street's perception of high-flying AI companies such as Nvidia. Even so, CoreWeave's forward P/S multiple is substantially lower than Nvidia's, suggesting CoreWeave stock is a better value. The company's shares have about doubled from its IPO price of $40 at the time of this writing. Its strong trend of sales growth could lead to further stock appreciation. However, Nvidia shares warrant a higher valuation. The tech giant is profitable, a leader in the AI field, and its dilutedearnings per sharerose 82% year over year to $0.89 in Q4, which shows it's delivering results for shareholders. CoreWeave has little history to demonstrate whether it can do the same. Therefore, only investors with a highrisk toleranceshould consider buying CoreWeave stock. Nvidia is a strong company under Huang's leadership, and its P/S ratio drop makes now a good time to invest in this AI stock.",

        "header": "Did Nvidia Just Say \"Checkmate\" to Rivals?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.99%)built an empire in what could be today's most promising technology: artificial intelligence (AI). It all started with a powerful chip -- the graphics processing unit (GPU) -- which is designed to rapidly handle specific types of computing problems: those that can be easily broken down into a large set of smaller problems that can solved simultaneously. Initially, Nvidia sold this product to the gaming market, because producing high-resolution, fast-moving video game graphics is just the sort of task that parallel processors are made for. But over time, the tech world found other uses for GPUs. And eventually, when AI started really taking off, it became clear that they were the best hardware available for the training and inferencing of AI models. With the best GPUs on the market and a highly popular platform for developers, Nvidia rapidly became the No. 1 AI chip designer and developed a wide range of products and services to enhance its status as the go-to purveyor of AI hardware. Still, one threat that Nvidia continues to face is the emergence of rivals, from fellow chip designerAdvanced Micro Devicesto some of its own big tech customers, which are designing their own AI chips. Competitive offerings from these players could put pressure on Nvidia's prices and slow its red-hot growth. But Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, speaking at Computex (a computer industry expo in Taiwan) earlier this week, announced a key new release from the company -- something that could greatly reduce its risk of losing meaningful market share to those would-be challengers. Did Nvidia just say \"checkmate\" to its rivals? Image source: Getty Images. First, a quick summary ofthe Nvidia storyso far. The company has shiftedits GPU focusfrom video games to AI, and added a multitude of related products. All of this has resulted in massive revenue growth. It increased its quarterly revenues by rates in the double- and triple-digit percentages year over year, with these figures setting new records steadily. And, importantly, its top-line growth came at a high level of profitability, with gross margin surpassing 70%. But other chipmakers released competitive products at lower prices and Nvidia customers likeAmazonandMeta Platformshave spoken about their own in-house developed chips. For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS), sells (and rents cloud computing time on servers powered by) its own Trainium chip, a product it says its cost-conscious customers appreciate. Well, Nvidia in this area has decided if you can't beat them, join them. It's now making it easier for customers to use Nvidia systems along with central processing units (CPUs) and GPUs that are designed and manufactured by other companies. This is through the release of NVLink Fusion. This system will allow customers using NVLink -- a high-speed connection for the sharing of data between processors -- to now include non-Nvidia processors in that network. \"NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures,\" Huang said. Prior to this, NVLink only could be used with Nvidia processors, meaning customers would have to make a decision: either build with Nvidia or not. Now, with NVLink Fusion, customers don't have to choose. They could put their Nvidia processors to work with its peers' CPUs, GPUs, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), too. The one potential downside of this strategy for Nvidia is it may lead to slipping sales of Nvidia's CPUs, as customers won't have to invest in everything Nvidia to use NVLink. But I think the positives well outweigh that possible negative. NVLink Fusion offers chip buyers greater flexibility -- something that could be greatly appreciated as options multiply in this fast-paced market. It's important to note that NVLink Fusion makes it possible for customers to truly tailor their data centers to their needs and budgets. And this offers Nvidia an opportunity to broaden its customer base to ASIC data centers and to ensure it will maintain a key role in the AI infrastructure build-out as the AI boom progresses. So, this announcement may seem like a detail, but the debut of NVLink Fusion could be a significant move -- one that could keep Nvidia ahead. Does this mean Nvidia just said \"checkmate\" to rivals? Yes and no. I say \"no\" because this new system won't result in its rivals failing in AI or leaving the space. There's plenty of room for more than one player to be successful in this part of the chip space, considering the value ofthe AI marketis expected to soar into the trillions of dollars by the end of the decade. But Nvidia has said \"checkmate\" when it comes to ensuring its leadership -- the release of NVLink Fusion may be the move that, along with Nvidia's innovation, keeps it on top of the AI world for the long haul.",

That's the sentiment NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang echoed on May 21 as he insisted the US is losing big amid the restrictions. The remarks come on the chip giant paying the biggest price for being restricted from selling advanced chips to clients in China. A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. \"All in all, the export control was a failure,\" Huang said. According to Huang, the export control restrictions have only forced Chinese companies to buy semiconductors from local designers such as Huawei at the expense of US companies. The net effect has been a loss of billions of dollars in revenues for US companies. \u00a0In addition, Nvidia has warned that the US stands to lose its dominance in AI as Chinese companies resort to aggressively investing in developing supply chains that don't rely on the US. Nvidia has experienced a significant decline in market share in China due to the export controls from 95% to 50%. The decline is expected to continue as Chinese companies increasingly develop their AI chips and other alternative solutions.

        "content": "With trade tensions easing, stocks have rallied and are looking to potentially head into their next bull run. After leading the last bull market higher,artificial intelligence (AI)stocks seem to have regained their footing and could be ready to lead again. Let's look at three AI stocks ready for a bull run. Image source: Getty Images. Where AI infrastructure spending goes,Nvidia(NVDA-0.99%)is sure to follow. It's both the biggest risk the company faces and its biggest opportunity. The stock pulled back after the Trump administration enacted some tougher export restrictions for AI chips going into China, but trade deals with Middle Eastern countries that included investments in AI infrastructure eased investor concerns. Sovereign AI, or government AI spending, could be the next big driver of spending on the technology. This would be on top of the strong spending already being seen fromcloud computingcompanies and companies training foundation AI models, such as OpenAI andMeta Platforms. With an over 80% market share in thegraphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia is very well positioned to continue to benefit from ongoing AI infrastructure spending. Meanwhile, its CUDA software platform and its collection of AI-focused libraries and tools that help streamline development and optimize the performance of its chips give it a wide competitive moat in the space. The stock is still reasonably valued with aforward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)of 31 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.6price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), with numbers below 1 considered undervalued. Another company well-positioned to benefit from increased AI infrastructure spending isBroadcom(AVGO0.33%). The company makes components that are crucial parts of data center infrastructure. It also has carved out a sizable niche in helping customers develop custom AI chips known as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). While GPUs are more readily available and offer more flexibility, custom AI chips can offer better performance for the specific task for which they were designed while reducing power consumption. There are considerable up-front costs involved in designing these custom chips, but they can help lower the overall cost of ownership over time for customers, given that they are more energy efficient. Custom AI chips are Broadcom's biggest opportunity, and it has been gaining customers. It said it sees a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity in its fiscal year 2027 (ending October 2027) from its three customers that are furthest along. Meanwhile, it has picked up added customers, includingApple, that are not included in those projections. It won't capture all of this business, but it is a huge opportunity for the company. Trading at a forward P/E of 29 times analysts' fiscal 2026 estimates, the stock is attractively valued given the huge potential ahead. The biggest risk would be if AI infrastructure spending were to slow down. While Nvidia and Broadcom design AI chips,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.10%)is the company that actually makes them. It is the leading semiconductor contract manufacturing in the world and counts companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple among its top customers. Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex process that requires technological expertise, high utilization rates, and scale. Foundries are always looking to become more efficient by increasing the functional size of their wafers through advanced packaging technologies and shrinking chip sizes. Smaller chips are more powerful and consume less energy. TSMC, as the company is also known, leads the way in manufacturing advanced chips and has become an invaluable partner to its customers. As the clear leader in the space, it has garnered strong pricing power. At the same time, it is working closely with its largest customers to expand its manufacturing capacity to meet their future needs. Increased capacity and higher prices are a powerful combination that has helped TSMC achieve strong revenue growth and expand itsgross margins. Last quarter, its revenue climbed 35% to $25.5 billion, while its gross margin expanded 190 basis points to 58.8%. Its new U.S. production facilities are expected to be a gross margin headwind, although it apparently is looking to raise prices from its Arizona site by 30% to help offset the higher costs. It's also looking to raise its overall prices by 10%. Trading at a forward P/E of 21 times 2025 analyst estimates and a PEG of 0.6, the stock is cheap. Similar to its two AI chip customers, the biggest risk TSMC faces would be a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, as this would lead to less demand for chips.",

        "header": "Where Will Nvidia Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.99%)stock has seen some volatile trading lately. After sinking in response to concerns about the demand outlook for advanced artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and new import taxes that threatened to destabilize global trade, the company's share price benefited from explosive rebound momentum after the Trump administration announced a softening of its tariff policies. With Nvidia stock surging following the Trump administration's shift on tariff policies, investors may be wondering whether it's now too late to buy into the stock. Read on for a look at what two Motley Fool contributors think Nvidia's prospects are over the next three years. Image source: Getty Images. Keith Noonan:Nvidia has been at the forefront of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators since the AI revolution started rapidly gaining steam a couple of years ago. Thus far, there's little indication that competitors, includingAdvanced Micro DevicesandIntel, are catching up to the company. Meaningful advances for Chinese designers, including Huawei, could emerge at some point, but it looks like demand for those processors will be largely concentrated in China and its allies. With AI potentially providing major competitive advantages for both companies and governments, there will continue to be massive incentives to invest heavily in the kind of high-powered hardware that Nvidia has a big edge in. Even better, the company has strengthened its competitive moat through its CUDA software platform, which helps developers get the most out of AI processors. This will likely make it very difficult for AMD, Intel, and other players to beat Nvidia in the space. With Nvidia posting great sales and margins, it's also got more flexibility to experiment in other potentially explosive categories, including agentic AI software and robotics. Rivals, including AMD and Intel, are having a hard enough time competing in the AI processor space, and that hypothetically leaves them with less flexibility when it comes to spending big to branch outside their core competencies. With significant macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty on the horizon, there's a good chance that Nvidia stock will continue to see significant volatility this year. On the other hand, the company's strength in the AI processor space should continue to help Nvidia score strong sales and earnings and also facilitate pushes into other business categories. Nvidia still faces some substantial risks over the next three years, but I think the most pressing risk factors for the stock are potential macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics that extend to the market at large. Jennifer Saibil:Nvidia had been a winning stock for years before it became a household name in the age of generative AI. Some uncertainties about the future, however, make it harder to determine where it could be in three years and whether it's worth buying today. It was a success in the past for its gaming products, but it became a household name thanks to its dominant position in the quickly expanding generative AI sector. Explosive demand for its GPUs continues, with sales jumping 78% year over year in fiscal 2025'sfourth quarter(ended Jan. 26) to $39 billion. Looking ahead, management guidance called for sales to increase 65% in fiscal 2026's first quarter. CEO Jensen Huang said the continuing incredible demand can be attributed to the company's newest generation of AI products under the Blackwell name. Management noted how far-reaching and multilayered its opportunity is. Its products now serve multiple industries beyond internet and technology, and they are put to use in many more ways than before. Of particular relevance is the growing demand for GPU-driven data centers, or what Nvidia management calls AI factories. The entire paradigm of how a data center works is changing, with more emphasis on machine learning and generative AI, ramping up the data center market opportunity from $1 trillion to $2 trillion. This is of particular relevance because data centers now account for 88% of Nvidia's revenue. As with any new technology, new competition will try to copy a good thing and try to do it for a cheaper price. Top tech companies likeAmazonandAppleare working to design specialized GPUs at a lower cost to drive at least some part of their operations, even if they still rely on Nvidia for the moment. That means even if the opportunity is growing, Nvidia's share of it might not increase proportionally, and more options for clients could also erode its pricing power. Finally, it's interesting to add Nvidia's valuation to the analysis. It trades at a forward one-year P/E ratio of only 24. That could be an indication that the market thinks the company is slowing down. The drop in share price could be because the market is pricing in the effects of competition and saturation. On the other hand, it could just be that the company is growing fast enough to keep pace with the market's expectations, implying that this growth stock is a bargain. That could mean it's undervalued, and the lag between the market's perception and the reality of what's coming could create a windfall for patient investors over the next three years.",

        "content": "(Reuters) -A data center in Texas that startup Crusoe is building for OpenAI has secured $11.6 billion in funding to expand from two to eight buildings, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The data center \u2014 expected to be the ChatGPT parent's largest \u2014 will use up to 50,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips per building, according to the report. The funding, a mix of debt and equity, will increase the total amount secured for the project to $15 billion, the WSJ report said, citing Crusoe. The development of these data centers is a crucial step for OpenAI as it looks to expand key infrastructure necessary for tackling complex tasks employed by generative artificial intelligence, while reducing dependence on its backer Microsoft. OpenAI, Nvidia and Crusoe did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Crusoe, launched in 2018 as a cryptocurrency business, has pivoted to building AI infrastructure and is among the upcoming \"neoclouds\" that provide specialized AI cloud and data center services. The startup was tapped by Oracle to build the first data center for the $500 billion Stargate project, Reuters had reported in January. Crusoe is building its own data center in Abilene, Texas that will hold 100,000 specialized AI chips per building and is set to come online this year.

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.99%),Apple(AAPL-0.98%), andMicrosoft(MSFT-0.21%)are the three most valuable stocks in the world right now, with market caps north of $3 trillion. They are prominent names in tech, and all stand to benefit significantly from artificial intelligence (AI) as they enhance their existing products and services. But while these stocks have all been doing well, I'm not confident that they will remain on top when looking at the longer term -- the next five years. By then, I think one company will surpass all of them in value, and that'sAmazon(AMZN-1.01%). Image source: Getty Images. While Amazon is already a massive company, and it, too, is worth a sizable amount -- over $2 trillion, I see plenty of room for it to become even more valuable. Here are just some of the AI-related opportunities that the company is pursuing: There are a plethora of opportunities for Amazon when it comes to AI. For a business that generated nearly $33 billion in free cash flow last year, it has the resources at its disposal to continue investing heavily in AI, which can pay off significantly in the future. From enhancing its online marketplace to entering in new opportunities like robotaxis, it arguably has more to gain from AI than the tech stocks that are more highly valued than it is right now. Amazon has plenty of growth potential ahead, but for it to catch up to the big three, it'll probably need them to stumble. Here's why I think that will happen. Amazon was involved in AI well before ChatGPT made it a hot buzzword in the market. The company has looked for ways to automate its warehouses and use next-gen technologies to make its processes more efficient. With so many ways to still benefit from AI's growth, I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes the most valuable stock in the world in the next five years. Amazon is a topgrowth stockto own, and one that you can buy and forget about.",

        "header": "Is Super Micro Computer a Better Stock Pick Than Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.99%)has been a very successful stock pick over the past few years, but some are worried that it may be heading for some bumpy times. However, there's a strong trend toward more data center buildouts, as we're a long way from having artificial intelligence (AI) deployed to the scale that many people envision it can reach. That's whereSuper Micro Computer(SMCI-4.49%)comes in. It makes data center components that house and cool computing devices within a data center. This is a critical part of data center infrastructure, but does it make Supermicro (as the company often calls itself) a better pick than Nvidia? Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia rose to the top of the computing market through its best-in-classgraphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to process multiple calculations in parallel. They can also be connected in clusters to amplify this effect, so they have been top picks in data centers focused on AI processing. GPUs create a ton of heat, and managing that heat load effectively is critical for optimal performance and the service life of the GPU. Supermicro offers a few solutions, but the most intriguing option is its direct liquid cooling (DLC) method, which uses liquid to cool computing devices instead of air. By using liquid, Supermicro doesn't need to account for as much airflow within a data center, so it can pack more computing devices into a smaller area. The company estimates this technique offers a 40% energy savings and 80% space savings, which makes building these expensive data centers far cheaper. While Nvidia's superior product offering distinguishes it from its competitors, Supermicro doesn't have the same degree of separation. Some of Supermicro's competitors also offer liquid cooling options, so they don't have Nvidia's pricing power. This shows up in the difference between eachcompany's gross margin.  NVDA Gross Profit Margindata byYCharts Nvidia can charge a massive premium for its product because it knows that it has a superior offering. Supermicro cannot, as its clients could easily go to another competitor within the space. This is one strike against Supermicro, but there are other reasons Supermicro may be a smart stock to consider. Recently, Supermicro announced a $20 billion partnership with DataVolt, a Saudi Arabian data center company. This caused the stock to rise rapidly, gaining around 20% since that announcement and 43% in the last month. This is a big deal for Supermicro's stock, but after the positive reaction to the news, it is far more expensive than it was just a few weeks ago.  SMCI PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At 22 times forward earnings, Super Micro Computer now trades at the same valuation as theS&P 500. Despite the deal, Supermicro isn't expected to grow as fast as Nvidia. For fiscal year 2025, which ends June 30, Supermicro's revenue is expected to rise 48%, while Nvidia's is expected to increase at a 53% clip for fiscal year 2026, which ends in January 2026. Those are still two incredibly fast growth rates, and no investors should be disappointed in either rate. So, with the two growing at the same rate and Supermicro's stock being cheaper than Nvidia's, does that make it a buy over Nvidia? I'd say no. The biggest issue for me is Supermicro's falling gross margin, which rapidly declined over the past few quarters. There isn't a massive differentiating factor between Supermicro's product and its competitors, so it could easily be disrupted if someone comes out with an innovative technique or technology. Nvidia has solidified its spot in nearly all data centers built around the globe, and its technology is a differentiating factor between it and its competitors,which is why I think Nvidia is a better stock pick between the two.",

        "content": "It seems like everyone is trying to identify the next bigAI stock. There are many to choose from, but as with any craze, picking long-term winners from long-term losers can be a difficult task. While there are many exciting names to choose from, there's one business in particular that every artificial intelligence investor needs to own in 2025 and beyond. Artificial intelligence will be one of the biggest growth opportunities this century. The United Nations believes that the AI market will zoom from $189 billion in value in 2023 to nearly $5 billion in value by 2033. But betting on AI isn't as easy as just buying any business exposed to this massive theme. Some companies are developing AI technologies, some are consuming these technologies to gain competitive advantages and operational efficiencies, and yet others are selling to the AI developers themselves, making future innovation possible. There's an old saying: When everybody is digging for gold, it's good to be in the pick-and-shovel business. This wisdom advises investors not to go straight into the rush itself, but to supply the rush with the requisite supplies. This way, no matter who finds gold, or whether or not there is gold at all, you still come away with a profit. In this regard, no AI stock shines more thanNvidia(NVDA-0.99%). Nvidia is by far the leading supplier of GPUs to the AI industry. Sometimes, these specialized GPUs are sold directly to AI developers. Most sales, however, are directed toward data center providers or cloud computing providers. These businesses own data centers around the world powered by GPUs. When an AI developer wants to train a model, a mature AI business wants to execute an AI application, or a consumer wants to use that application on their smartphone, the data required is usually processed and delivered using cloud computing infrastructure. Roughly 90% of data center GPUs are manufactured by Nvidia -- a dominant market share that shows how much more powerful and in-demand its chips are compared to the competition. Therefore, nearly any business or individual that wants to incorporate AI into their processes will be using Nvidia chips. And any developers looking to build new AI applications will also likely be using Nvidia chips. Put simply, Nvidia is sitting at the center of the AI revolution. However, over the past five years, Nvidia's stock has risen by an astounding 1,400%. Is it too late to jump in? You might be surprised by the answer. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia stock looks expensive at first glance, with shares trading at roughly 46 times earnings. But this is already a very profitable business, and sales continue to grow at double-digit rates. Looking ahead based on next year's earnings, the stock trades at just 30 times forward profits. That's still a premium to theS&P 500's forward earnings multiple of around 23, but the valuation starts to seem much more reasonable once you factor in some expected growth.  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts The most important thing to keep in mind is that the AI revolution won't unfold over the next year or two. This is truly a multidecade opportunity. Nvidia will face competitive and pricing pressures over time, but market growth will be sustained for so long that even if some market share is ceded, the company should still be able to grow significantly over the next decade. As with any growth stock, Nvidia shares will be exposed to high levels of volatility. But if you're willing to stay patient, the upfront premium isn't as steep as it seems, and this one AI stock should be a continued winner through 2025 and beyond thanks to its central position in the AI supply chain.",

He endorsed the Trump administration's effort to abandon the tiered restrictions. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Nvidia has taken a $5.5 billion charge related to U.S. limits on exports of its H20 chips to China. Huang estimated the restrictions could cost Nvidia up to $15 billion in lost revenue. The company's China market share dropped to 50% from 95% since the Biden administration imposed the AI diffusion rule, which blocked advanced chip exports to China. In response, Chinese firms like Huawei gained traction, and the country boosted its domestic chip infrastructure. Huang said competition in China has become intense and noted that many in the country would prefer Nvidia not return. He projected the Chinese AI market could be worth $50 billion by 2026, a key opportunity despite geopolitical hurdles. To navigate current limits, Nvidia is working on a modified Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with U.S. rules. Meanwhile, China has demanded that Washington remove discriminatory chip measures, warning of further action if curbs persist. The Trump administration is reportedly considering a new global licensing regime to replace the existing three-tier model, which could give the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang criticizedthe U.S. government's restrictions on exporting artificial intelligence chips to China, calling the policy a \"failure\" that cost American companies billions in lost revenue. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Speaking at the Computex conference in Taipei, Huang said the Biden-era export rules created under the so-called AI Diffusion policy were based on flawed assumptions. The rules, introduced in January, blocked high-end processor sales to China and limited supply to other countries. Huang emphasized that over half of the world's AI researchers are based in China, and the U.S. restrictions forced many to turn to local suppliers like Huawei. President Donald Trump has said he plans to end the policy if re-elected. Huang voiced support for that plan, saying it acknowledges that U.S. firms are not the only providers of advanced chips. Earlier this year, Microsoft raised similar concerns, saying the policy could boost China's AI sector. Nvidia's share of the Chinese AI chip market has dropped from 95% to 50% since President Biden took office.

        "header": "Can You Beat the S&P 500? The Answer Might Surprise You",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is a highly efficient and well-diversified benchmark that tracks the performance of around 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. It is a widely accepted proxy for the overall market, and when people say \"the market,\" that's usually what they mean. The ultimate humble-brag for investors is \"I beat the market.\" However, consistently outperforming the market\u2019saverage 10% yearly returnis difficult. Even the best fund managers struggle to outperform the S&P 500 in consecutive years. According to SPIVA Scorecards, 89.5% of funds underperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. The only way to beat the S&P 500 is to buy lower and sell higher. While that might be possible in any given year, consistently beating the market boils down to a few built-in advantages of the S&P 500, which are hard to replicate: In anefficient marketlike the S&P 500, current prices reflect all public, relevant information (earnings reports, interest rates, breaking economic news, and even CEOs' tweets) in the underlying assets' value. The more information that becomes available and the quicker the information gets into the hands of investors, the faster asset prices move to keep up, significantly reducing arbitrage opportunities. The S&P 500 is one of the world's most liquid markets, with billions of dollars in daily trading activity. Analysts and even algorithms constantly scan the market for price discrepancies and exploit them within milliseconds, leading to extremely high trade volumes and sometimes razor-thin profit margins that add up over time. The S&P 500 represents the 500 largest and most influential companies in the U.S. across all 11global industry classification standards (GICS)market sectors. The S&P 500's inherentdiversificationhelps smooth volatility and protect the portfolio from huge price swings in any one sector or industry. Following 500 companies looking for profit opportunities is a tall order for even the best fund managers, so funds and individual portfolios will likely be more concentrated. Investors and funds may try to pick winners, time the market, and beat the S&P 500 withactive management strategies. The success of theactively managed portfoliorelies on the skill of the management team or investor in extrapolating data and predicting market movements. However, fund managers don't have a crystal ball, and their decisions are subject to human error. They may also respond erratically to economic news. Passively managed funds that track indices like the S&P 500 typically have much lower fees than actively managed portfolios. Active management strategies require frequent trading, which means higher fees, whether investors choose a fund or try to replicate the results themselves. Funds using active management often charge as much as 1% or more, which eats into returns and makes beating market returns much more of an uphill battle. A 1% expense ratio might not seem too expensive, but the difference can substantially impact returns over time compared to low-cost index funds charging as little as .03%, like Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO). The phrase \"time in the market beats timing in the market\" gets passed around more than colds in an office for good reason. Even the best investors and portfolio managers can struggle to predict when to buy and sell. Market movements are not linear; historically, they move more like someone bouncing a ball while walking upstairs, and missing the upward catch can mean missing out on major gains or losing big. Many of the market's biggest gains happen in short bursts\u2014often when investor confidence is low. But if you wait too long or try to predict the perfect moment, the opportunity can disappear in a flash. Tracking the S&P 500 does not involve jumping in and out of the market at every news cycle or economic update. Lefty Gomez, a New York Yankees pitcher, famously said, \"It's better to be lucky than good.\" In the instance of the S&P 500, good investors can create their own luck by not trying to predict wins and allowing the S&P 500 to do the work for them. Beating the S&P 500 is hard, but not impossible, especially in any given year. The S&P 500 finished 2024 with a more than 24% return, but several funds knocked it out of the park. 2024 performance:51.8% Investment strategy:ALGRX focuses on long-term appreciation by seeking investment opportunities that demonstrate positive growth potential. Trusting AI's emerging advancements and importance helped catapult returns for ALGRX in 2024. Top holdings:Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon 2024 performance:45.81% Investment strategy:This S&P 500 benchmark fund tracks the large-cap equities in the market with the highest momentum score, rebalancing only twice per year. Top holdings:Nvidia, Broadcom, Palantir, and IBM 2024 performance:45.65% Investment strategy:FDG notes, \"Our bottom-up investment process seeks to uncover companies with durable competitive advantages we believe offer opportunities for higher and sustained growth.\" Top holdings:Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta 2024 performance:40.10% Investment strategy:This fund seeks long-term growth by investing in emerging large-cap companies. They saw success in 2024 because they invested in e-commerce and technology and rode the wave of market enthusiasm. Top holdings:Cloudflare, MicroStrategy, DoorDash, and Tesla 2024 performance:37.66% Investment strategy:PGKRX focuses onlarge-cap technology or technology-related companies. Technology had a good year in 2024, and PGKRX's well-managed portfolio was able to outpace the S&P 500 returns. Top holdings:Nvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft, and Apple There are no guarantees with investing, but someinvestment strategies can tilt the oddsin their favor, especially when executed with discipline and long-term goals in mind. A common thread among the funds' strategies that beat the S&P 500 was that the fund managers sought out companies with growth potential and momentum. Diversifying a portfolio across many sectors to reduce the impact of volatility and investing in stocks with high-growth potential in sectors like AI, clean energy, or e-commerce can help you capitalize on opportunities without bottoming out in downturns of individual sectors. During bull markets, investors tend to lean into riskier investments when prices rise. As the prices continue to increase, these riskier investments take up a disproportionate share of the portfolio, leaving the portfolio's risk vs. reward balance askew. It's important torebalance a portfolioduring this time to help maintain balance. Additionally, when markets fall and the riskier stocks \"go on sale,\" buying more will benefit portfolios over time rather than selling off these stocks because you got scared. Investors quickly overlook a dividend, but savvy investors should consider investing in companies with a proven history of increasing dividends. Dividend-paying stocks provide income and capital appreciation and often outperform non-dividend-paying stocks in the long run. One of the most effective strategies for investment success is taking a \"do-nothing\" approach. Investing to beat the market relies on skill, education, discipline, and a whole lot of luck. Experiments, like the one by Jeff Ptak, showed that portfolios left untouched often beat more actively managed accounts. His theory is that investors would see more success by removing discipline, market timing, and predictions from the equation. In the period from 1993 to 2023, at least, he was right. According to SPIVA Scorecards, only around 10% of large-cap actively managed funds consistently beat the S&P 500 over a 10-year period. Some financial advisors may beat the S&P 500 in individual years, but consistently beating the S&P 500 is extremely rare, even for experienced fund managers. ETFs with concentrated exposure to one sector, like those focused on technology or AI, may beat the S&P 500 in individual years. However, their higher exposure to only one market sector greatly increases volatility and risk. Berkshire Hathaway, led by world-renowned investor Warren Buffett, has historically outperformed the S&P 500. For example, from 1965 to 2021, Berkshire stock's average yearly return was 20.1%, while the S&P 500's was 10.5%. Beating the S&P 500 is possible, but achieving higher returns consistently is rare. Without an experienced team or extensive experience in market predictions, investors are probably better off investing with their risk tolerance, goals, and timeline guiding their choices. Even pros struggle to beat the S&P 500. Anchoring a portfolio around a low-cost S&P 500 fund might not outperform the index, but with the market\u2019s strong historical returns, it can still put investors ahead over time.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang reportedly called Washington\u2019s export curbs on the sale of AI chips to China a \u201cfailure\u201d that would drive Chinese rivals to speed up developing their own semiconductors. \u201cI think all along the export control was a failure,\u201d Huang said, according toThe Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe local companies are very talented and very determined, and the export controls give them the spirit, energy and the government support to accelerate their development,\u201dThe Journalreported Huang as saying. Huang suggested that could lead American firms like Nvidia to lose market share in China. \u201cFour years ago, Nvidia had 95 per cent market share in China. Today, it is only 50 per cent,\u201d theFinancial Timescited him as saying at the Computex technology show in Taipei on Wednesday. \u201cThe rest is Chinese technology. They have a lot of local technology they would use if they didn\u2019t have Nvidia.\" Nvidia declined to comment beyond Huang's remarks at the event. Last month, Nvidia said it would take a$5.5 billion chargedue to new export curbs on the sale of its H20 chips to China. The H20 chip is less powerful than Nvidia's newer ones and had beentailoredto meet prior export limits for the Chinese market. Nvidia peer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also said it expects to face charges of up to$800 millionrelated to limits on sales of its MI308 chip to China. Nvidia is set to report its fiscal first-quarter results after the closing bell next Wednesday. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up about 2% in recent trading, and have added about 2% since the start of the year.",

We've identified 2 warning signs with NVIDIA (at least 1 which is a bit concerning) and understanding the impact should be part of your investment process. Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value. NVIDIA's recent AI-focused partnerships with Accenture, Dell Technologies, and Infineon Technologies underline its commitment to expanding its technological capabilities. These developments may bolster NVIDIA\u2019s revenue streams and contribute to its already substantial growth prospects. Analysts have projected a potential annual revenue growth of 30.3% over the next three years, suggesting these collaborations could play a significant role in realizing this expansion. Furthermore, the company's robust performance, with shares increasing significantly over the past five years, reflects investor confidence in its strategic initiatives. The total return for NVIDIA's stock, including dividends, was very large over this period, indicating strong long-term growth. Over the past year, NVIDIA's stock performance surpassed the broader U.S. semiconductor industry, which saw a 19.7% return, emphasizing its superior market momentum. In the short term, the 39% rise in NVIDIA's share price reflects positive sentiment following its latest announcements. Compared to its current share price of US$113.54, analysts' consensus price target stands at US$163.21, suggesting further upside potential if NVIDIA meets its projected revenue and earnings targets. Such forecasts rely on NVIDIA capitalizing on its AI and autonomous vehicle ventures, with projected earnings expected to reach US$158.2 billion by 2028. This potential for expanded earnings and market influence underscores the relevance of the company's latest developments in reinforcing its growth trajectory and achieving analyst expectations.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. chief Jensen Huang blasted the \u201cfailure\u201d of US restrictions intended to contain China\u2019s technological ascent, calling on the White House to lower barriers to AI chip sales before American firms cede that market to up-and-coming rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport Seeks Up to $4.3 Billion of Muni Debt NJ Transit Makes Deal With Engineers, Ending Three-Day Strike Huang called for policymakers to propel US AI technology by easing export curbs aimed at curtailing the rise of a geopolitical rival. Some corners of Washington are receptive to that argument when it applies to countries like Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, which have close ties to China \u2014 but Huang has so far failed to turn the tide of restrictions that specifically target the world\u2019s second largest economy. China alone will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026, Huang told reporters at Computex in Taipei. If American tech providers like Nvidia aren\u2019t allowed in, local customers will just spend that money elsewhere, he said. The relaxing of restrictions would directly benefit Nvidia, the company at the heart of a global AI infrastructure boom. Huang\u2019s views align with the likes of White House AI adviser David Sacks, who has pushed for ensuring the world builds its AI tools and applications on an American \u201ctech stack\u201d \u2014 a full complement of hardware and services based on US know-how. The Trump administration is rescinding restrictions on Nvidia chip shipments to much of the world, though officials are drafting a replacement framework. US officials have also reaffirmed Washington\u2019s opposition to the use of chips from Huawei, a frontrunner in China\u2019s technology industry, provoking outrage from Beijing. \u201cAll in all, the export controls were a failure. The facts would suggest it,\u201d Huang told reporters, in some of his harshest criticism yet of the US campaign. \u201cThe US should maximize the speed of AI diffusion. Because if we don\u2019t, the competition will come.\u201d Emphasizing his point, Huang added that \u201cChina has 50% of the world\u2019s AI developers, and it\u2019s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology.\u201d A top Trump administration official acknowledged Huang\u2019s concerns about export controls more broadly but said there was a consensus in Washington to maintain restrictions aimed at containing China\u2019s AI ambitions. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make a distinction between: Are semiconductors being used inside China or elsewhere?\u201d Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. \u201cThere is still bipartisan and broad concern\u201d about how advanced processors are used once they\u2019re in China, Krishnan said. The assumption that the US is the only place that develops and provides AI infrastructure is fundamentally wrong, Huang said. Behind the scenes at the weeklong tech expo in Taiwan, Huang said he\u2019d met SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son several times to discuss the $500 billion Stargate project. That data center build-out, led by SoftBank and partners including OpenAI, will depend heavily on Nvidia gear, though it has run into snags with securing funding. Nvidia itself is smarting from controls on the sale of its highest-end chips to China, the world\u2019s largest semiconductor arena. It\u2019s written off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips for the China market \u2014 products originally designed to comply with export curbs on higher-performance parts \u2014 after the Trump administration extended restrictions to include those semiconductors. In Taipei on Wednesday, Huang said Nvidia cannot further downgrade those chips to make them compliant, so it\u2019s discarding the inventory. Huang reiterated the warning that if Nvidia can\u2019t sell in China, Huawei and others will fill the gap. \u201cPower is quite cost-effective in China. And there\u2019s plenty of land. And so the ban on H20 is not effective for that reason,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThey\u2019ll just buy more chips from the startups, from Huawei, and others. And so I really do hope that the US government recognizes that the ban is not effective and give us a chance to go back and win the market.\u201d --With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins, Michael Shepard and Ed Ludlow.

        "content": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Omaha home, which he bought for just $31,500 in 1958, is now estimated to be worth as much as $1.5 million. That\u2019s a nearly 45-fold increase, an impressive return by any standard, once again underscoring Buffett's focus on value and investing for the long term.  Warren Buffett purchased his Omaha home in 1958, at just 28 years old. He and his then-wife, Susan, were raising three young children and sought a practical, comfortable place to call home. The property they chose was a five-bedroom stucco house built in 1921, located on a corner lot not far from Omaha\u2019s city center. Buffett\u2019s rationale for the purchase reflected the same value-driven mindset that defined his investment career. He and Susan delayed buying until they felt financially secure, weighing whether to use their savings for a home or invest elsewhere. Buffett saw the house as a sensible, long-term investment, one that offered stability for his family without unnecessary excess. He has often described the home as one of his best investments, ranking it just behind his wedding rings for the memories and satisfaction it provided. Buffett\u2019s home is now estimated to be worth between $1.2 million and $1.5 million in 2025, according to recent valuations from Realtor.com, Zillow, and some news outlets. The most frequently cited figure appears to be $1.4 million. This appreciation far outpaces that of most U.S. homes, whose median sales price rose from $17,800 in 1963 to $416,900 in early 2025, roughly a 23-fold increase. Despite this impressive growth, Buffett\u2019s home remains modest by billionaire standards. For comparison, many ultra-wealthy individuals own properties valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Bill Gates\u2019s 66,000-square-foot estate in Washington is valued at $127 million. For Buffett, the house\u2019s value is less about financial return and more about personal satisfaction and practicality. He has repeatedly stated in interviews and shareholder letters that, while the home was his third-best investment, he would have made more money by renting and investing the difference in stocks. Learn from Warren Buffett's first home purchase: patience, practicality, and a focus on value can yield significant long-term financial benefits. His early experience shows that wealth isn't all about lavish possessions and that discipline and a long-term commitment truly matter. When making your own financial decisions, prioritize lasting value, understand what you're getting into, and let your genuine needs, not fleeting trends or outside pressures, be your guide.",

The S&P 500 can propel retirement savings in the early years for young investors. With decades until retirement, young investors can weather the stock market's highs and lows with plenty of time for recovery. A portfolio for a young investor should have a high equity allocation. Investors in their 20s should strive for as much as 90% of their portfolio in stocks. Even workers in their 40s still have plenty of runway before they take off, so an 80% stock allocation is appropriate for many of their investment portfolios. Prince Dykes, founder and chief investment officer at Royal Financial Investment Group, said that he finds his younger clients often favor low-cost, passive investing (e.g., ETFs likeVOOorSPY) and are \"more comfortable with technology-driven investment platforms.\" Thebuy-and-hold strategyhas a proven success record in the long term. Staying invested through all market cycles is key to success. Trying to \"time the market\" is usually counterproductive. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)involves regularly investing the same amount of money into a security. It is an effective way for investors to remove the pressure to time the market, lower their average cost per share, and reduce the impact of market fluctuations in their portfolios. DCA into funds with a solid record, like S&P 500 funds, helps build discipline and reduce the emotional impact of market swings. Investing is a rollercoaster, and understanding how to hold on when the market dips is crucial for success. Still, it's shocking to see your portfolio balance plummet, but that's when investors need to go back to the basics and remember theirrisk tolerance, timeline, and goals. If your portfolio aligns with those factors, you should stay the course or even buy the dip, which can lower your cost basis over time. Martin A. Smith, founder and president of Wealthcare Financial Group, reminded investors, \"The key to avoidingpanic sellingis rooted in strategy, not sentiment. When the market pulls back, it may simply be an opportunity to rebalance, not retreat.\" Despite being in their highest earning years, mid-career investors usually feel their belts tighten when sandwiched between the costs of raising their own children and caring for aging parents. Dropping investment contributions seems easy when stretching the household budget, but continuing steady contributions is critical to long-term success and to help reach your retirement goals. For investors withmatching contributions, continuing to invest up to the matching employer contribution level doubles the impact of their savings. By the time investors enter their late 40s and early 50s, they've probably started to think about retirement more concretely than in their early investor years. As that time draws closer, investors should gradually shift their asset allocation away from stocks and into assets focused on capital preservation and income. In excellent years for the market, like 2024, when the S&P 500 returned 23%, it may seem ill-advised to reallocate away from stocks.However, as you get closer to retirement, you should be gradually smoothing out volatility in your portfolios. The Rule of 100is a retirement savings guideline where you subtract your age from 100 to determine your ideal stock allocation. This rule is a helpful starting point, but many advisors consider it overly simplistic. As Martin put it, \"A portfolio built solely around one's age may leave investors overexposed just when they need stability the most.\" Further, Martin added, \"Economic disruptions\u2014like 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis\u2014don't respect retirement dates.\" Appropriate stock allocation is far more dependent on an investor's age, timeline, and goals than on a magic number. Some experts advise using 110 minus your age or even 120 or 125 minus your age instead of the standard Rule of 100 formula. However, even that is just a guideline. Rebalancing is the part of investing that many investors skip. When markets are popping off, few investors think that signals a great time to offload some top performers. However,rebalancingin mid-career years is especially important as market gains can distort intended asset mixes. Thomas Kopelman, co-founder and financial planner at AllStreet Wealth, warned, \"The biggest mistake is simply not rebalancing... If you did this from 2008 till now, you would be very overweight in large-cap growth and very underweight in international bonds if you are older or have a lower risk tolerance.\" The closer you are to retirement, the more protecting what you've earned becomes your top priority. Focusing on capital preservation doesn't mean stuffing $100 bills in your mattress, and it doesn't mean ditching stocks entirely. Equity investments may still have a place in your portfolio as you get closer to clocking out for the last time. Martin said, \"A conservative portfolio can certainly include S&P 500 holdings to boost return potential, but it should be part of a widerasset allocation frameworkdesigned to reduce volatility and safeguard capital as retirement approaches.\" Diversification across asset classes like bonds, stocks, and government securities becomes increasingly vital at pre-retirement, as most people reduce equity exposure and add income-producing or capital preservation assets. Even within asset classes, it's a good idea to look closer at where your money is going, especially in equity investments. S&P 500 funds or ETFs are inherently diversified. However, Thomas cautions that overexposure to the S&P 500 alone can be risky, especially for pre-retirees: \"Right now, Mag Seven stocks (Magnificent Sevenor the seven largest and most influential tech-oriented companies) are over 35% of the Index.You may want to be more diversified than that, especially as you get older and near retirement.\" Prince noted that the S&P 500 is still appropriate for some investors with shorter time horizons. However, its allocation should shrink as retirement approaches: \"Using a blended approach that shifts as the target date approaches emphasizes stability while maintaining some growth potential.\" Byaligning portfolios with evolving income needs, considering expenses like health care, travel, or housing, investors can better support their lifestyle while preserving their nest egg. Experts, like those at Fidelity, offersavings benchmarks by agerather than dollar amounts. They suggest saving at least 1x your salary by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67. Most retirement accounts (401(k)s, IRAs, and brokerage accounts) offer S&P 500 index funds as a holding option. If you're having trouble finding one in the available offerings, you can search by ticker symbol. The S&P 500 is a good investment for retirees if it aligns with their current risk tolerance, timeline, and goals. It offers growth potential, but retirees should anchor that growth and associated risk with bonds or other income-producing assets. The S&P 500's average return is around 10% annually before inflation. After inflation, its return is around 6-7%. Past performance does not guarantee future results, but the S&P 500 has a historical success record. Whatever your age, the S&P 500 can be a powerful foundation for a retirement portfolio covering large-cap exposure in one diversified swoop. Young investors can lean into the potential growth that equity investments offer, mid-career savers should gradually reallocate their portfolios to match their risk, and pre-retirees should prioritize capital preservation and income while leaving room for some growth. Your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance will shift with each life stage. Allow them to drive your investment vehicles without fear or hype over market returns.",

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world\u2019s second largest economy.  \u201cWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,\u201d Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. \u201cWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they\u2019re physically inside\u201d the country, he added.  While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang\u2019s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created \u201cGPU haves and GPU have nots.\u201d  \u201cWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.\u201d  Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a \u201cfailure\u201d and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.  Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. \u201cChina has 50% of the world\u2019s AI developers, and it\u2019s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,\u201d he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.  Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies\u2019 access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.  \u201cThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,\u201d said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. \u201cMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.\u201d",

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) soared to a fresh record on Wednesday amid increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies on Capitol Hill and Wall Street. Bitcoin jumped as high as $109,900 around midday Wednesday, surpassing the previous record reached in the lead-up to President Trump\u2019s inauguration in January.\u00a0The digital currency slipped to around $108,000 in recent trading, trackinga decline in U.S. stocks. Once a fringe financial asset dismissed by the mainstream, cryptocurrencies have gained new legitimacy this year thanks to the support of President Trump and several allies in Congress. The Senate on Monday voted to advance a bill that establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, putting the upper chamber of Congress on track to pass its first piece of cryptocurrency legislation. And earlier this year President Trump ordered the Treasury to establisha Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Washington\u2019s acceptance of cryptocurrency has accelerated the finance industry\u2019s own embrace of digital assets. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, said the bank wouldallow clients to buy bitcoin. Several other major financial institutions, like investment bankMorgan Stanleyand asset managerBlackRock, have already waded into crypto offerings. Bitcoin ETFs saw substantial inflows in the last month as investors piled into risk assets amid easing trade tensions. Investors have pumped an estimated $6.5 billion into BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in the last month, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. That influx of money has pushed it up to 5th from 47th in the ranking of U.S. ETFs with the greatest year-to-date inflows. The price of bitcoin has also been supported by surging demand from Bitcoin Treasurys, publicly traded companies that use proceeds from equity sales to purchase bitcoin for corporate treasuries. Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy (MSTR), which originated the scheme, purchased $765 million worth of Bitcoin last week, bringing the value of its Bitcoin holdings to more than $63 billion.Last month, a blank check company headed by Brandon Lutnick, the son of President Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, announced it wouldlaunch a Strategy competitorcalled Twenty One.",

        "content": "Treasury debt continued its wild ride on Wednesday, with yields soaring amid concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s unsustainable deficit spending. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond surged as high as 5.1%, its highest level since November 2023, on Wednesday after a surprisingly weak 20-year Treasury note auction. The 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on all kinds of consumer and commercial loans, climbed to about 4.61%, its highest level since February. The Treasury on Wednesday announced the results of a 20-year note auction in which demand was notably weaker than in last month\u2019s sale. The auction\u2019s highest yield rose to nearly 5.05% from 4.81% a month ago, while the bid-to-cover ratio, a common measure of demand, fell to 2.46 from 2.63. Rising yields weighed on stocks. The S&P 500, trading marginally lower at midday,tumbledto finish the session down 1.6%, notching itssecond consecutive dayof declines. Yields at their current levels could pose a problem for the stock market. Not only do high yields translate into higher interest rates on consumer and commercial loans, they also reduce the appeal of risky assets. \u201cA break above 4.50 is likely to turn the equity return/bond yield correlation meaningfully negative again, thus pressuring valuation,\u201d wrote Morgan Stanley analysts, referring to the 10-year yield in a research note earlier this month. Stocks, having sharply rebounded from their steep losses in April, are currently trading at relatively rich valuations. The S&P 500 as of Friday\u2019s close had a P/E ratio of 23.82, above its 10-year average of about 18. Yields have been trending higher since the beginning of the month when signs of easing trade tensions reassured investors the U.S. will avoid a recession this year. The Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts has also caused investors to reset their rate expectations, fueling the rise in yields. This week, yields have been nudged higher by the GOPtax and spending billcurrently working its way through Congress. The bill, which would extend and add to many of the tax breaks enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in President Trump\u2019s first term, is expected to dramatically increase the federal deficit over the next decade. America\u2019s ballooning deficit has caused investors across the globe to question U.S. debt\u2019s status as the world's premier risk-free asset.

Rising bond yields appear to beat the forefront of the market narrative once again. In a research note to clients on Wednesday, Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz detailed key levels to watch on the 10-Year Treasury yield and their potential implications on stocks. \"The path of rates will also be crucial for equities, particularly for relative performance,\" Kantrowitz wrote. \"Since 2022, equity markets have struggled when 10yr rates moved above 4.5%-4.75% and we are pushing up against that zone once again.\" As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate sensitive stocks typically see increased underperformance. This played out in Wednesday's action with the Russell 2000 Index (^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&P 500, falling nearly 2.2%.

The S&P 500's (^GSPC) macro moment may be over. As tariff news whipsawed markets to start the second quarter, stocks moved roughly in unison. In April, the one-month correlation of stock movements within the benchmark index soared to nearly 0.7, a level only seen in the past five years when the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in 2022 and during the onset of the pandemic. But as President Trump has dialed back the height of his tariffs on other nations, the correlation between stocks in the S&P 500 has tumbled to about 0.16. Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients that this is a sign that the market is shifting from a macro-driven market, where headlines on US trade policy have produced massive swings, to a market driven by company-specific fundamentals. \"After two months of macro-dominated markets, we\u2019re likely to continue seeing markets, economic outlooks and sentiment stabilize,\" Kantrowitz wrote on Wednesday. \"We are transitioning to a backdrop with mixed data and mixed views. This should keep market correlations low, as stocks should trade more with micro fundamentals and note entirely on macro headlines like we saw earlier this year.\" He added that \"many of the macro fears that remain are more likely to be issues that differentiate stocks rather than dominate all of them.\" CoreWeave (CRWV) stock isripping higher againon Wednesday. Shares were up more than 10% in early trading and have now soared about 50% in the past five sessions. The move higher comes after CoreWeave's first quarterly financial update as a public companyrevealed a revenue forecast far above Wall Street's expectations a week ago. In a research note on Wednesday, Citi analyst Tyler Radke boosted his 12-month price target to $94 from a prior target of $43. Radke noted his now anticipating \"a cadence of strong [financial results]beats in the near term\" for the Nvidia-backed AI play. But after a more than 100% rally since its IPO, Radke's new price target merely reflects roughly where CoreWeave stock was changing hands on Wednesday. \"While we'd argue a portion of the re-rating is justified, given strong Azure/hyperscaler numbers and capex, we reiterate our Neutral/High Risk rating as we\u2019d like to see more progress on profitability and more customer diversification,\" Radke wrote.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- CoreWeave Inc.\u2019s rally is running so hot it\u2019s leaving analysts\u2019 stock predictions in the dust. Citi Research more than doubled their 12-month price target on the stock to a Wall Street high Wednesday morning. When the market opened shares blew past it in the first 15 minutes of trading. Most Read from Bloomberg Can Frank Gehry\u2019s \u2018Grand LA\u2019 Make Downtown Feel Like a Neighborhood? Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport Seeks Up to $4.3 Billion of Muni Debt NJ Transit Makes Deal With Engineers, Ending Three-Day Strike Marquee partnerships, optimistic revenue outlook and a renewed enthusiasm for all things artificial intelligence have driven CoreWeave to all-time highs, bucking some critical reviews from Wall Street. Gains stretched into the fourth-consecutive session, to close at a record. The stock has more than doubled from a late March initial public offering at $40 a share. The stock soared 19% to close at $107.39 Wednesday trading after Citi analysts led by Tyler Radke boosted their price target to $94 from $43 while sticking to their neutral, high-risk rating. CoreWeave\u2019s first quarterly earnings report as a public company, which beat on revenue, should ease worries that demand was waning, they said. The report reinforced the hyperscaler\u2019s high-growth profile, \u201cand likely assuages investor concerns around AI capex/infrastructure slowing,\u201d the analysts wrote raising their estimates for second-quarter and full-year revenue as they slashed the discount they were applying to the stock\u2019s valuation. Bullish investors have been cheered by last Thursday\u2019s deal worth as much as $4 billion for the company to provide additional cloud computing capacity for OpenAI, a leader in the space. Though gains were erased that day by an analyst\u2019s downgrade. The following day the rally resumed after Nvidia Corp. reported a larger-than-expected stake in the company, shares jumped 22% to a record high. Gains continued this week as Nvidia\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang kicked off Computex, Asia\u2019s biggest electronics forum, in Taiwan and outlined plans to let customers use rival chips in data centers built around its technology, a nod to in-house development by major clients like Microsoft Corp. But Wall Street skeptics are numerous with with eight of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommending holding the stock and two advising to sell. Eight recommend buying CoreWeave. Bears point out CoreWeave\u2019s earnings were mixed, the report had initially sent shares lower. And the company\u2019s revenue is tied to only a handful of customers. D.A. Davidson\u2019s downgrade last Thursday compared CoreWeave to WeWork and said it is \u201cnot worth scaling.\u201d It was the only day of the past eight that the stock ended the trading day lower. The average analyst price target of $67 suggests the stock could fall nearly 40% over the next 12 months. And, some of the stock\u2019s upside could be exaggerated by its low float \u2014 only 13% of total outstanding shares are currently available to trade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, the stock also boasts high short interest \u2014 more than 40% of the stock\u2019s float has been used to bet against shares, according to data from S3 Partners LLC. Even with Citi\u2019s price target boost, the analysts reiterated their neutral rating while acknowledging some of the recent rally is justified given strong numbers from hyperscalers and Azure. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see more progress on profitability and more customer diversification,\u201d Radke said.

        "content": "Navitas\u2019 GaN and SiC technologies have been selected to support Nvidia\u2019s 800 V HVDC data center power infrastructure to support 1 MW IT racks and beyond NVIDIA Selects Navitas to Collaborate on Next Generation 800 V HVDC Architecture TORRANCE, Calif., May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Navitas Semiconductor(Nasdaq: NVTS), the industry leader in next-generation GaNFast\u2122 gallium nitride (GaN) and GeneSiC\u2122 silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors, today announced a collaboration withNVIDIA(Nasdaq: NVDA) on their next-generation 800 V HVDC architecture to support \u2018Kyber\u2019 rack-scale systems powering their GPUs, such as Rubin Ultra, enabled by GaNFast\u2122 and GeneSiC\u2122 power technologies. NVIDIA\u2019s next generation of 800V DC architecture aims to establish high-efficiency, scalable power delivery for next-generation AI workloads, to ensure greater reliability, efficiency, and reduced infrastructure complexity. Today\u2019s existing data center architecture uses traditional 54 V in-rack power distribution and is limited to a few hundred kilowatts (kW). Bulky copper busbars are required to transfer this low-voltage electricity from the rack-mounted power shelves to the compute trays. As power increases above 200 kW, this architecture runs into physical limits due to power density, copper requirements, and reduced system efficiency. Modern AI data centers require gigawatts (GW) of power for the increasing demand for AI computation. Nvidia\u2019s approach is to directly convert the 13.8 kV AC grid power to 800 V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers (SST) and industrial-grade rectifiers, eliminating several AC/DC and DC/DC conversion steps, maximizing efficiency and reliability. Due to the higher voltage level of 800 V HVDC, the thickness of copper wires can be reduced by up to 45%, due to I2R losses, where the same amount of power can be delivered with increased voltage and lower current. Using a traditional 54V DC system, over 200 kg of copper would be needed to power a 1MW rack, which is not sustainable for next-generation AI data centers with GW power demand. The 800V HVDC directly powers the IT racks (eliminating the need for additional AC-DC converters) and is converted by DC-DC converters to lower voltages, which will drive GPUs, such as the Rubin Ultra. Navitas is an established leader in AI data center solutions enabled by GaN and SiC technology. Thehigh-power GaNSafe\u2122 power ICsintegrate control, drive, sensing, and critical protection features, enabling unprecedented reliability and robustness. GaNSafe is the world\u2019s safest GaN with short-circuit protection (350ns max latency), 2kV ESD protection on all pins, elimination of negative gate drive, and programmable slew rate control. All these features are controlled with 4-pins, allowing the package to be treated like a discrete GaN FET, requiring no VCCpin. Additionally, Navitas offers a family of medium voltage (80-120V) GaN devices, which have been optimized for secondary side DC-DC conversion, delivering high-speed, high efficiency, and small footprint, for AI data centers PSUs with outputs of 48V-54V. Enabled by 20 years of SiC innovation leadership, GeneSiC proprietary \u2018trench-assisted planar\u2019 technology provides world-leading performance over temperature, delivering high-speed, cool-running operation for high-power, high-reliability applications. G3F SiC MOSFETs\u00a0deliver high-efficiency with high-speed performance, enablingup to 25\u00b0C lowercase temperature, and up to 3x longer life than SiC products from other vendors. Offering the industry\u2019s broadest voltage range \u2013 stretching from 650 V to ultra-high voltages of 2.3 kV to 6.5 kV, the SiC technology has been implemented in multiple projects for MW energy storage and grid-tied inverters\u00a0with the Department of Energy (DoE).  Fig. 1. Navitas GaN and SiC technologies cover the complete power delivery from grid to the GPU. In August 2023, Navitas introduced a high-speed, high-efficiency3.2 kW CRPS, achieving a 40% smaller sizethan best-in-class, legacy silicon solutions for power-hungry AI and Edge computing. This was followed by theworld\u2019s highest power density 4.5 kWCRPS, achieving a ground-breaking 137 W/in3, and an efficiency of over 97%. In November 2024, Navitas released theworld\u2019s first 8.5 kWAI data center power supply, powered by GaN and SiC that could meet 98% efficiency, complying with the Open Compute Project (OCP) and Open Rack v3 (ORv3) specifications. Additionally, Navitas createdIntelliWeave, an innovative patented new digital controltechnique, that when combined with high-power GaNSafe and Gen 3-Fast SiC MOSFETs, enables PFC peak efficiencies to 99.3% and reduces power losses by 30% compared to existing solutions. Alongside theComputexexhibition in Taiwan, the latest release of their 12 kW PSU was presented at the Navitas \u2018AI Tech Night\u2019on 21stMay. \u201cWe are proud to be selected by NVIDIA to collaborate on their 800 HVDC architecture initiative. Our latest innovations in high-power GaN and SiC technologies have seen world firsts and have created new inflections into markets such as AI datacenters andelectric vehicles\u201d, said Gene Sheridan, CEO and co-founder of Navitas. \u201cWith our wide portfolio range, we can support NVIDIA\u2019s 800V HVDC infrastructure, from grid to the GPU. We appreciate that NVIDIA recognizes our technology and commitment to driving the next generation of data center power delivery.\u201d NVIDIA\u2019s 800V HVDC architecture will improve end-to-end power efficiency up to 5%, reduce maintenance costs by 70% (due to fewer PSU failures), and lower cooling costs by directly connecting HVDC to the IT and compute racks.To read NVIDIA\u2019s technical blog, please clickhere.

The gaming chip, designed by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), will be manufactured using Samsung\u2019s advanced process. This will be a notable shift for Nintendo as it sourced chips earlier from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM). However, such a change in strategy appears prudent for Nintendo as the company wants to ramp up production to meet its targets for the much-awaited gaming console. A close up of an employee's hands at a digital gaming console, controlling a popular game. The company has estimated that sales will reach around 15 million units by March next year. However, the console witnessed strong demand during the pre-orders, with 2.2 million orders in Japan alone. Considering such demand, the market expects sales to exceed that estimate and touch 20 million. Changing to a faster manufacturer should help the company meet those elevated expectations. Nintendo develops, manufactures, and sells home entertainment products, including video game hardware and software. While we acknowledge the potential of NTDOY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "content": "The S&P 500, or Standard & Poor's 500, comprises around 500 of the U.S.'s largest publicly traded companies and has historically delivered strong long-term returns. Investing in the S&P 500, as a proxy for the market, feels like betting on the U.S. to win. But like any investment, the S&P 500 isn't all growth and no groans. Investors hoping to include the S&P 500 in their portfolios should learn the risks of the S&P 500, such as concentration and valuation risk, and what strategies can minimize that risk while still harnessing the S&P 500's power in their portfolios. The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the performance of approximately 500 of the U.S.'s largest publicly traded companies. The companies in the S&P 500 spanmarket sectors such as technology, consumer staples, health care, and financials. Together, these companies make up about 80% of the total value of all U.S. stocks, making the S&P 500 synonymous with \"market\" and the proxy report card for how the entire U.S. market is doing. There is one caveat, however, to making market assumptions based solely on the S&P 500. Larger companies have more influence over the market's returns. If a few large companies are doing well, the market will look like it's booming, even if smaller companies are riding the returns struggle bus. The returns of the S&P 500 are hard to beat even by seasoned professionals. This makesinvesting in ETFs or mutual fundsthat track the S&P 500 tracking ETFs or mutual index funds an attractive option for many investors. However, no investment is without risks, and the S&P 500 has its fair share of vulnerabilities that can upset the apple cart, especially in the short term. Here are some key risks of investing in the S&P 500 that investors should consider before entering the market: The S&P 500 includes company stocks from all major market sectors, but larger companies have more impact on S&P 500 returns. Currently, the S&P 500 hasmega-captech stocks, commonly called \"Magnificent Seven,\" driving a significant portion of the index's performance. A rising tide lifts all boats, where the tech companies and the S&P 500 are concerned. Unfortunately, the reverse is true as well: stumbles in the technology sector can cause the whole market to fall. The weight of stocks in this sector and its disproportionate effect on the overall market introduces concentration risk for investors without assets outside the index. The S&P 500 has a strong growth history, but the growth is not linear, and the market is immune to market downturns. Think of market performance like a bouncing ball while walking upstairs. Will the ball end up much higher eventually? Sure. But getting to the top is full of ups and downs. The S&P 500 has endured its fair share ofbear marketsand corrections since it started tracking 500 stocks in 1957. Even the steadiest investors with a firm understanding of market cycles can get shaken up by nasty bear markets like the 51.9% drop over 1.1 years from 2007-2009. Short-term volatility is particularly worrisome for investors with a low risk tolerance or those nearing retirement. Bull runscan lead to periods of high optimism where investors flood the market to chase potential earnings. Price, impacted by supply and demand, may reach unsustainable levels during periods with a high volume of trading activity, creating valuation risk. If conditions change, like interest rate hikes or disappointing earnings, the overinflated stock prices deflate quickly when demand tapers. The S&P 500 is very sensitive to economic and geopolitical factors because, no matter the strength of the underlying companies, they do not exist in a bubble. Valuation comes from profits, stock prices, and future outlooks. The market hates uncertainty. Rising interest rates, inflation, global conflicts, recessions, tariffs, shrinkingGDP, or the threat of these events can depress share prices. The S&P 500, representing the broader U.S. market, has a history oflong-term growth, but it has not always been a smooth ride for investors to the top. The S&P 500 averages a bear market, where stock prices decline 20% or more, once every six to 10 years.These major downturns can spook investor confidence in the short term. However, investors with time on their side can ride out short-term losses for long-term gains. The S&P 500 endured 22 bear markets since 1928, but most investors probably remember just a few. Most remember thedotcom bubble bursting, sending the S&P 500 tumbling nearly 50%.In this instance, investor enthusiasm and market demand drove prices for these newfangled internet startups beyond sustainable levels. The prices held on for a while until the mild recession and the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, which caused contracted prices and tech-heavy investors to suffer the consequences of valuation and diversification risk. Investors probably also remember one of American history's steepest and severest bear markets. In theGlobal Financial Crisis of 2007-2009, the S&P 500 fell more than 55%.This financial collapse, triggered by overvaluation and subprime lending in the U.S. housing market, lit a match that burned much of the global economy because foreign banks had large holdings of U.S. mortgage-backed securities. The global impact of that crisis affected nearly all investors as economic activity stalled and all sectors suffered. Despite the impact of market downturns, the S&P 500 has a strong track record of recovery. It may not be fast, but we all remember the fable of the tortoise and the hare. After the dotcom crash, the market took nearly seven years to recover fully, and the recovery was followed almost immediately by theGreat Recession. Thankfully, the 2008 bear market recovery took only four years. The cyclical nature of market rise and fall highlights some important lessons for investors. Those who remained cool, calm, and collected despite economic or geopolitical shockwaves to the S&P 500 were often rewarded in the long run as markets recovered. The S&P 500's turbulent history confirms that investors with a long-term investing mindset, diversification, and emotional regulation reap rewards. There are some time-tested strategies investors can use to mitigate risks associated with the S&P 500 while keeping it a core asset in their portfolio. Don't put all your eggs in one index. The S&P 500 includes a diverse range of sectors, but it still concentrates heavily on large and mega-cap stocks. The history of market cycles shows us that even with a solid track record of growth, only investing in the S&P 500 through ETFs or mutual index funds is risky. Investors can reduce that risk by investing in assets like small-cap funds, international stocks, real estate,alternative investments, or fixed income investments like bonds and certificates of deposit. Just because you know what goes up must come down, doesn't mean you're prepared to wait out the drop. Investment success is not just picking shooting star assets; it's also about feeling comfortable and confident in your decisions when your shooting stars start to fade. Consider consulting a financial advisor or using online risk tolerance questionnaires to determine your capacity for risk. This can help you decide how much of your portfolio belongs in the S&P 500 and other assets. The S&P has had some fantastic gains and terrible losses over the years, but has an average growth of 10% yearly since the index expanded to 500 stocks in 1957.That 10% annual return doesn't come from trying to time the market perfectly; it comes from getting in and staying in it. A long-term investment strategy works for equity investments because, with time on your side, you have time for your portfolio to recover from inevitable market downturns. Regular portfolio rebalancing is an important risk mitigation strategy because some assets may grow faster than others, which can throw off your target allocation. Rebalancing at regular intervals ensures that your portfolio remains aligned with your risk tolerance, goals, and timeline. Yes. Since the S&P expanded to 500 indexed stocks in 1957, the market has crashed multiple times, but each time it has recovered. Your timeline, goals, and risk tolerance will drive the share of your portfolio in large-cap stocks like the S&P 500. Younger investors may prefer a higher allocation of the S&P 500 in their portfolio, up to 90%, but many investors find 60% large-cap equities a sweet spot. The S&P 500 is an index composed entirely of large and mega-cap stocks, so investors could diversify their portfolios by considering small-cap stocks, real estate investments, commodities, or income-producing assets like bonds. At a minimum, investors should rebalance annually. Many investors prefer to rebalance semi-annually or when any asset class drifts more than 10% from its target allocation. Investments tracking the S&P 500 offer investors broad exposure to 500 of the U.S.'s largest publicly traded companies. Even though the S&P 500 has a history of strong performance, it is not risk-free. To make good decisions, investors must understand the risks of investing in the S&P 500, like its concentration in big tech, valuation concerns, and volatility. If you choose to add ETFs or mutual funds that track the S&P 500 to your portfolio, you can manage these risks by diversification, regular portfolio rebalancing, and aligning investments with your risk tolerance, timeline, and goals.",

        "content": "It's that time of year again: Billionaire investors have offered us a peek into their latest investing moves through 13F filings. These are required quarterly by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from managers of more than $100 million in U.S. securities, and they detail the latest buys and sells of these major investors. Why are 13Fs useful for us? They offer us an idea of what thesebillionaires are doingin the current market environment -- and since these investors clearly have proven their abilities over the years, we might look to them for investing inspiration. This doesn't mean we should follow their every move. Some may not be right for our investing strategies or our comfort with risk. But becoming familiar with the moves and strategies of billionaires might offer us some ideas to adapt to our own portfolios. In the latest filing period, reported this month, billionaire Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management added to his shares of two artificial intelligence (AI) giants that each completed stock splits last year -- and they've gone on to gain in the double digits since. Let's take a closer look at Coleman's first-quarter moves and decide whether these stocks are buys today. Image source: Getty Images. Coleman got his start working as a research analyst for famed investor Julian Robertson at Tiger Management, and eventually became a partner. Known as one of Robertson's \"Tiger Cubs,\" he then went on to launch Tiger Global, a firm that today manages more than $50 billion -- and focuses heavily on innovation. For example, his top holdings as of the end of the first quarter wereMeta Platforms, with a 16% weighting, andMicrosoft, weighted 8% in the portfolio. Now, let's consider Coleman's recent purchases of two AI stocks that completed stock splits last year. I'm talking about AI chip giantNvidia(NVDA-1.82%)and networking powerhouseBroadcom(AVGO-0.70%). Nvidia completed its stock split last June and has advanced 11% since that time, and Broadcom split its stock in July and has soared 34% since then. The companies decided on splits after gains pushed their share prices beyond $1,000 -- a stock split would bring these prices down, making the stocks more accessible for employees and other potential shareholders.A stock splitdoesn't change anything fundamental about a company, but it lowers the per-share price by issuing more shares to current holders. These operations also may signal a company is confident about its prospects, with the idea that the stock has what it takes to soar once again. In the first quarter of this year, Coleman did the following: Coleman surely got in on these players for a good price, since both companies saw their valuations in relation toforward earnings estimatesdecline in the first quarter.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts This decline happened as investors worried about the impact of President Donald Trump's import tariffs on the economy and corporate earnings. And Nvidia and Broadcom weren't the only ones to suffer. Growth stocks in general, due to their sensitivity to the economic environment, have led indexes lower in recent weeks. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their valuations increase in recent weeks, to 31x forward earnings estimates and 34x, respectively, amid optimism that Trump's tariff deals with countries won't weigh on growth as much as expected. But they still remain at reasonable levels, considering these companies' positions in the AI market and prospects for success there in the years to come. Nvidia has reported booming revenue growth, reaching record levels quarter after quarter. And Broadcom, also seeing tremendous growth, said AI revenue surged 77% in the recent quarter. So, should you follow Coleman into these AI stocks that, following their stock splits, continued to climb? The answer is simple: If you're looking for potential long-term AI winners -- yes, Nvidia and Broadcom still make fantastic buys today. As mentioned, their prices are reasonable. Importantly, both have reported strong AI growth in recent quarters, and the general outlook for the AI market in the years to come suggests there is plenty of room for such well-established players to excel well into the future.",

        "content": "Cathie Wood doesn't shy away from taking risks. It's part of what has garnered her a loyal following of investors who like her bold style. Her flagship fund's 152.8% return in 2020 probably helped, too. Of course, risk-taking often comes with downsides. The same fund, theARK Innovation ETF, is still down more than 60% since its 2021 peak, while theS&P 500is up nearly 45%. Still, many continue to look to Wood as a luminary of innovation investing. Wood recently took to social media platform X to tell her followers that she believes the CEO of one of her largest holdings when he says his company will become the largest pure-play enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) software company in the world. That company,PalantirTechnologies(PLTR-4.00%), also happens to be one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. So, should you own this favorite stock of Cathie Wood? The company, which helps organizations leverage AI to improve decision-making in real time, is executing at a very high level. There's no doubt about that. Clients as diverse asFerrariand the U.S. Army count on its advanced technologies. This utility has driven consistent revenue and earnings growth. The chart below shows how strong its growth has been on the top line (revenue) -- and especially on its bottom line (earnings).  PLTR EPS Diluted (TTM)data byYCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months. The magic is in both the uber-advanced technology itself and the company's ability to adapt it in a unique manner to each of its clients. This isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, and it's part of why its AI solutions can take on such complex problems. The company sends what it calls its \"forward deployed software engineers\" to work with its clients to create a bespoke solution that starts with a deep understanding of the real problems. Note the military flavor of Palantir's terminology here. If \"forward deployed\" wasn't clear enough, they're also called \"deltas,\" apparently in reference to U.S. Army elite special operatives. The company deliberately fosters a sense that they are \"in the trenches,\" at war with the issues its clients face -- and to be sure, that's often literally true as Palantir counts as clients five branches of the U.S. armed forces. Image source: Getty Images. This relationship, aside from delivering incredibly effective and responsive results for the clients,makes Palantir's services sticky-- that is, there is a high cost to switching to a competitor. From the incredible level to which its systems are integrated with its clients' systems, to the psychological bonds forged having its deltas \"forward deployed,\" the decision to sever ties with Palantir is likely not one made lightly. This is nothing new for investors who have followed the company at all, but the fact is that the stock is incredibly expensive. Theprice-to-earnings ratio (P/E)currently sits just shy of 560. Its price-to-sales ratio (P/E) is 102. These are astronomical. This table below compares these current figures toNvidia's andCisco's at their peaks. You might be thinking that Palantir's growth justifies these inflated numbers, at least for a time. Perhaps, but consider that its sales growth right now is only about 66% of Cisco's at its peak, and its earnings growth is slower than Nvidia's current growth, which in turn is much less than it was during its peak. There is just no way to square this circle. Palantir's valuation is wildly out of proportion, and that makes it a ticking time bomb. There is no doubt that it is operating at an extremely high level, but this sort of valuation requires perfection, something no company can deliver. I would say that unless the stock falls significantly -- let's say, 50% -- I would not consider owning it, regardless of what Cathie Wood thinks of it.",

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Though mortgage rates are influenced by a complicated web of factors, one of the most prominent impacts comes from movement in the U.S. bond market\u2014and specifically, changes to the yield of 10-year Treasurys. That effectshowed up todayas investors react to congressional deliberations of President Donald Trump's proposed tax bill. Since experts say passing the billcould inflate the federal deficitbecause it would extend substantial tax cuts and boost government spending for years, investors are concerned about its potential impact on the economy. As a result, major stock indexes were down today, while the 10-year Treasury yield surged 11 basis points.That's the highest yield since February. Treasurys shooting up took mortgage rates along for the ride today.

        "header": "3 Unloved Tech Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Many tech investors like to hunt for companies that could be the next hot stock -- ones that have the potential for quick and steep rallies that defy the broad market's expectations and perhaps even their own underlying fundamentals. Some stocks that fall into this category might be heavily shorted, a condition that sets them up forshort squeezes. (If you \"short\" a stock, you benefit when the price falls.) Others might be irrationally underpriced relative to their growth prospects. On the occasions when such beaten-down stocks rally, the initial surges can trigger secondary\"fear of missing out\" (FOMO)responses among other investors that drive their shares even higher. Two tech stocks that went parabolic over the past few years are AI darlingsNvidiaandPalantir Technologies. However, both of those red-hot stocks are unlikely to replicate those multibagger gains over the next few years, particularly considering their current scales. Investing is a long-term endeavor, but if you're looking for the next potential parabolic tech play, you might want to start by considering unloved stocks that have obvious flaws and are heavily shorted. Assuming such companies are able to resolve their pressing issues, their short-sellers would need to cover their positions -- sometimes hastily. That situation of shorts having to sell can spark short-squeeze rallies and attract the attention of more growth-oriented investors. Currently, three potential parabolic gainers worth looking at areSoundHound AI(SOUN-5.17%),Serve Robotics(SERV-3.47%), andPlug Power(PLUG-6.90%). Image source: Getty Images. SoundHound develops AI-powered audio and speech recognition tools. Its namesake app can be used to identify songs by it simply hearing a few seconds of audio or a few hummed bars, while its Houndify platform allows developers to create their own voice recognition applications. The stock closed at its all-time high in December. But since then, it has declined by more than 50%, and as of April 30, 31% of its float was being shorted. Nevertheless, SoundHound is still growing rapidly by locking in more customers for its software across the automotive, restaurant, financial, healthcare, and tech sectors. It also expanded its restaurant-facing platform recently with two big acquisitions. That said, SoundHound is still unprofitable, and it looks richly valued trading at 28 times this year's sales. Nvidia, which had owned a small slice of the company, liquidated its entire stake in it last year. Then management briefly delayed the company's 10-K filing in March. All of those issues are weighing down the stock. However, the consensus view among analysts is still for SoundHound's revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 54% over the next two years as more companies in more industries replace some of their customer service employees with AI-powered, voice-recognition-capable chatbots. Assuming the SoundHound follows that growth trajectory, it could shake off its short sellers and head a lot higher over the next decade. Serve Robotics, a developer of autonomous delivery robots, was founded in 2017 within Postmates.Uber(NYSE: UBER)acquired Postmates in 2020, spun off Serve as an independent company in 2021, but continued using its delivery robots for Uber Eats in the Los Angeles area. Serve Robotics' newest Gen 3 robots can travel at a max speed of 11 mph, last up to 48 miles on a single charge, and carry 15 gallons of cargo. They're also resistant to rain and extreme temperatures. Serve has deployed 350 delivery robots to date. Only 73 of those robots were running active routes during the first quarter of 2025, but it aims to deploy 2,000 robots for Uber Eats by the end of the year. Assuming it achieves that goal by expanding its core LA and Dallas/Fort Worth markets, analysts expect its revenue to grow from just $1.8 million in 2024 to $91.7 million in 2027. With a market cap of $600 million, Serve might not seem like a bargain at 6.5 times estimated 2027 sales. But if Uber expands its partnership to other cities -- and it attracts the attention of other delivery-driven companies -- it could grow much bigger. Serve's stock has dropped about 60% from its all-time high and 17% of its float was being shorted at the end of April, but this little robotics maker might just go parabolic in the future. Plug Power develops hydrogen fuel cell, charging, storage, and transportation technologies. It has already deployed over 70,000 fuel cell systems and more than 250 fueling stations across the world, and it's the world's largest single buyer of liquid hydrogen. AmazonandWalmart, which both use its hydrogen fuel cells to power their electric forklifts, are notably two of its biggest customers and investors (throughstock warrants). Plug's stock has plunged by 95% over the past three years (and is down by almost 99% from its 2021 peak), yet 25% of its float was still being shorted as of April 30. A lot of investors remain bearish on Plug because the market's demand for expensive new hydrogen projects remains chilly. But from 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Plug's revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 29%. This recovery could be driven by the stabilization of the hydrogen market, fresh contracts, and its $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy to build six green hydrogen manufacturing plants (which supports the Trump administration's long-term plans to boost domestic energy production). That's an impressive growth trajectory for a stock that trades at just 1.1 times this year's sales -- so any good news might just trigger a parabolic rally.",
