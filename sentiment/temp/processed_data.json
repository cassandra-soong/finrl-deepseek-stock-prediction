        "content": "By Rocky Swift TOKYO (Reuters) -Shares eased on Wednesday as investors turned cautious ahead of Nvidia's earnings on Wall Street later in the day, while the dollar held gains on promising economic signs in the United States. Market optimism over what appeared to be easing trade frictions between the U.S. and Europe faded. Global bond markets settled down after a scary surge in long-term yields, though a lacklustre auction for Japan's longest-dated bonds underscored lingering fiscal deficit concerns. U.S. consumer confidence surprised on the upside ahead of closely watched jobs figures on Thursday. Artificial intelligencechipmaker Nvidia jumped more than 4% on Tuesday and will be the last of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants to report earnings after markets close in the U.S. \"There is renewed confidence that Nvidia can beat the consensus estimates,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. If Nvidia comes through with better-than-expected sales and profit margins \"the rally is on\", he added. The chipmaker is expected to report that first-quarter revenue surged 66.2% to $43.28 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Ahead of the results, Nasdaq futures dipped 0.03% in Asia, while S&P 500 futures eased 0.06%. EUROSTOXX 50 futures fell 0.3%. In signs of a thaw between the U.S. and Europe, European Union officials have asked companies for details of their U.S. investment plans, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reversed gains from early in the session to fall 0.15%, as uncertainty overTrump's chaotic trade policies continues to linger. Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.22%, climbing a fourth straight session. China's CSI300 blue-chip index ticked up 0.08%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.4%. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.25%, adding to Tuesday's 0.6% rally. The euro was down 0.2% to $1.1304. Australian shares lost 0.16% and the nation's currency slid 0.26% after April consumer price data came in slightly above expectations. The kiwi dollar was last little changed after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut rates by 25 basis points as expected. Japanese bonds slid following tepid demand for an auction for the 40-year notes, with the 40-year JGB yield rising 9 basis points to 3.375%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. [JP/] Oil prices ticked up as the U.S. barred Chevron from exporting crude from Venezuela under a new authorisation on its assets there, raising the prospect of tighter supply. Brent crude futures rose 0.5% to $64.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude advanced 0.6% to $61.27 per barrel. Spot gold rose 0.1% after dropping more than 1% on Tuesday.

Tesla shares fell sharply between mid-December and early April amid concerns that Musk was too focused on his work leading the U.S. government's cost-cutting department, DOGE. However, the stock has rebounded since Musk told investors last month that hewould soon start spending more time at Tesla. While the shares are still down 10% since the start of the year, they have surged more than 60% from their early-April low. The stock gained nearly 7% to around $363 on Tuesday, hitting its highest level since early February. Below, we analyze thetechnicalson Tesla\u2019s chart and point out major price levels worth watching out for. After climbing above atriple bottomformation and the200-day moving average (MA), Tesla shares trended higher before consolidating inpennant, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock\u2019s uptrend.

It\u2019s worth pointing out this location roughly corresponds with a projected bars pattern target that extracts the price bars comprising the uptrend that preceded the pennant and repositions them from today\u2019s breakout point. This analysis projects how acontinuationmove could unfold on Tesla\u2019s chart. Buying above this level could drive a move toward the $489 level.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Rae Wee Earnings results from Nvidia will be the marquee event for markets on Wednesday, with all eyes on how much U.S. technology curbs on China will cost the AI bellwether. Company watchers expect the chip giant to report a 66.2% surge in first-quarter revenue to $43.28 billion, however uncertainty surrounding its China business looms large even as a pullback in other regulations is set to open up new markets. As it is, traders in the options markets are bracing for industry-wide volatility after the results, with defensive options contracts on a major semiconductor ETF drawing heavy attention. Earnings aside, investors will also be watching developments in global bond markets after demand on Wednesday for Japan's 40-year government bond auction was its lowest since November, underscoring the market's diminishing capacity to absorb new debt. Long-end yields have surged worldwide in recent weeks on a heavy selloff in bonds as concern mounts over fiscal deficits, particularly in developed nations such as the U.S. and Japan. Worries over tax cuts and that the United States' chaotic tariff policy will stoke inflation and propel government spending have made investors increasingly nervous about holding long-dated sovereign debt. On Tuesday, Reuters' exclusive report that Japan is considering trimming the issuance of super-long bonds was followed by a drop in both yields and the yen. Yields on Japanese government bonds were little changed following Wednesday's auction. U.S. Treasury yields edged up slightly after falling the previous day. Over in New Zealand, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points and flagged a slightly deeper easing cycle than it forecast three months ago, underlining risk to economic growth from a sharp shift in U.S. trade policy. Key developments that could influence markets on Wednesday: * North America earnings: Nvidia, Bank of Montreal, NationalBank of Canada, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Macy's * U.S. auction of two-year floating rate, five-year notes * German auction of 15-year Federal bonds * German unemployment data for May * France Q1 GDP final reading, producer prices for April Trying to keep up with the latest tariff news?

They discuss: To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out ourpodcast center. When you're ready to invest, check outthis top 10 list of stocks to buy. A full transcript is below. This podcast was recorded on May 24, 2025. David Gardner:The rule breakers that become rulemakers and yet continue to break the rules as they lead their industry and the world forward are the greatest stocks of our lifetimes. I would sayAmazonis a great example. I would sayNvidiais another great example. I would say, so isNetflix. By the way, are lesser known companies likeAxon EnterpriseorMercado Librethese are companies that started out with David positioning and are now within their contexts, the Goliath. Ricky Mulvey:I'm Ricky Mulvey, and that's Motley Fool co-founder and chief Rule Breaker David Gardner. He joined me for a conversation on today's show about his unique view on valuation and what really matters if you want to be an owner of industry leading rulebreaking companies. A quick note before we get started, no show on Monday. We are off for Memorial Day. Hope you're having a great long weekend. The reason I wanted to chat is, David, I've been thinking a lot about and not buying, maybe to my detriment, a company called Palantir. At the time of this writing, it's got a blistering valuation, about 95 times enterprise value to revenue. For listeners, that is all of the equity and debt over the trailing revenue. The market for this company is saying, we think that revenue can grow a lot. Almost to impossible standards to a normal valuation minded investor. The reason I wanted to talk to you is for a rule breaker, when a rulebreaker sees an expensive stock, that can actually be a good thing. Broadly speaking, to set the table, what are the first questions that a rulebreaker should ask when they see a stock with an incredibly optimistic valuation? I realized while we were chatting before, I didn't welcome you onto the show. It's also good to see you recorded medium. David Gardner, thanks for being here. David Gardner:It is always a pleasure, Ricky, and thanks for the invite. I think, first of all, when you're looking at companies that you want to invest in and you're going to take the approach that I take, which is, by the way, just one of many different approaches to beating the market. But I'm looking at the top dogs and first movers in important emerging industries. That is trait number one of rule Breaker stocks and there are six traits. We don't have to talk about them all, but that's the most important one. That's why it's number one. Ricky, I would say, first of all, we're focused not on all the stocks or the whole market. I, anyway, focus on the innovator in each industry. Who's the top dog, who's the first mover, not just any industry. Important emerging industries. That, for me, is the way to maximize your returns as an investor. Once we're talking about those, the rule breakers, some of the valuation received mores and expectations and things taught start to break down. In fact, you will never buy Palantir if you're trying to find a cheap Palantir. I'm not just talking about Palantir itself, though I am. I'm talking about all the other companies like Palantir that people consistently don't invest in, whether it was Amazon in 1997 or by the way, 2017 and probably 2027. Amazon always looks expensive.Starbuckshas always looked expensive within its industry. It's just coffee. Why is it trading at this kind of multiple? That's going to be true industry by industry, Ricky, for the rule breakers. Ricky Mulvey:Then, to double click on this, what's so good about these stocks that value investors that financial media are very quick to call? That is an expensive stock, and let us move on to the next topic. David Gardner:There are several intangibles that are going on in the innovators in each industry that are intangible in this sense. They are not counted in valuation metrics. Full stop. This is a critically important insight and one that I have discovered just by thinking about it and observing over time. I was like, Why are all the best companies always trading at premium valuations? Why wasIntuitive Surgicalwhen I first picked it in 2005, trading at something like 75 times earnings and yet, it's gone up more than 100 times in value since then in the 20 succeeding years. Ben a fantastic Rule Breaker. Virtually every great company from Tesla to Netflix, the list goes on. The great stocks of our time have all looked overvalued. Therefore, people who take traditional approaches never buy them. They don't recommend them. I think the intangible part is that that's not reflected on the balance sheet or income statement. We're going to talk about it in a sec. But the tangible part of this, Ricky, is that whether it's the CEO of the company, who is that? Whether it's the culture of the company, what is that? Whether the company is an innovator, can it innovate its way out of a box or not. Also, what about the brand of the company? The companies I've just mentioned in the last minute or so are some of the great brands of our time. Apple, the greatest brand of our time is also the largest market cap of our time, and that's a really important point that I hope everyone is hearing and taking away, often the performance of a company and the quality of its stock over time is directly correlated to its brand, but the four things I just highlighted for you, who the CEO is, what's the culture of the company? Can it innovate its way out of a box? What about its brand? None of those four is included anywhere in the financial statements. Yet, what are the things that lead businesses to glory or shame. Who's running it? What the culture is? Can they innovate? What about their brand, the promise you make to your customers every day? This is an incredibly important point. It's one I try to make big in my rule Breaker Investing book that comes out this fall. I hope it's going to be an eye opener for a lot of people, but we're getting to talk about it months ahead of it coming out because I've observed this for years, Ricky, and it's such an important point. Price to EV or different multiples, price to sales, price to earnings, price to book value. None of these is accounting for those four intangibles that are so very tangible to any company's success or failure. Ricky Mulvey:Brand is one that Lyncean investors can look at, as well. What do you perceive this brand to be in the marketplace? How do you feel about it? How do your friends feel about it? There's some examples we can't get into. But I also think it's important to separate, you know, there's the old saying and investing, price is what you pay, value is what you get. For listeners, one way to think about this for the meat eaters out there is steak. You know the difference between $25 stake, a $50 sake and $100 steak. It doesn't necessarily mean that one is less of a value than the other, depending on what your expectations are going in. When I'm looking back, though, on some of the biggest winners in the full universe, some of which you mentioned, David, Amazon, Netflix, Mercado Libre, I use Y charts, which sometimes can mess some things up, especially for historic multiples. These often traded above ten times enterprise value to revenue, sometimes even 45 times if you look at an early Amazon. But, that's a comparative value town to where Palantir is today, which is a more mature company. It is a nosebleed valuation even in the history of rule breakers. We can get to Palantir in a sec, but, you've come to this conclusion about buying so called expensive stocks over a number of years. As you were going through that experience, did you ever get that feeling, these stocks are getting awfully expensive when you were developing as an investor? David Gardner:I think it's natural to recognize when companies are at all time high, not just for their stock, but for their valuation multiples. I think that's smart. I think it's good that you're paying attention to those things, Ricky. I will say for my own part, I pay some attention to them, but not too much because fundamental to my approach, which again, is not going to be true of everybody at the Motley fool, and not going to be true of everybody listening. But fundamental to my approach is that I'm going to be holding that stock for years. When I buy a stock at a dead minimum, I'm holding it for at least three years. Preferably three decades. What ends up mattering is not the valuation multiple that you paid for 17 or seven years ago, which I can't even remember now. What matters far more. You can only see this once you play yourself forward a few decades as an investor, and then you get to start looking back and realizing these things, you start to realize what really matters is the impact of that company in the world. For the benefit of customers, of course, shareholders, but their employees, their stakeholders, the companies that are winning for everybody, not equally in all the time, but the companies that just keep winning. That performance of their products and services, what they're doing for our world at large, whether they're the real company behind the electric car revolution or the real company behind the streaming revolution or and Nvidia my best stock pick for Motley Full Stock Advisor, the company behind, as it turns out, the AI revolution, even though I bought them as a graphics processing chip company, you start to realize it's not the valuation is such a temporary thing. I think most people tend to overrate the importance of valuation to the detriment of recognizing the importance of the company's growth and maturation over time and really leadership and success. I often say, Ricky Mulvey, what do winners do? Ricky Mulvey:They keep winning. David Gardner:They keep winning. That is something that's very hard for a lot of people to accept because we tend to think what goes up must come down. Oh, my gosh, look at Palantir. It's a new highs or look at any stock at new highs. Probably I should wait for the dip because obviously what goes up must come down. But the direction of the stock market is not parabolic. It's not a cyclical up down, up down, up down. Actually, it's more hyperbolic. It's lower left to upper right, not always at the same time and sometimes downward. But this is really what I think we have to have as our mental pictures. That's what enables me, by the way, to buy a Palantir which I did not ten years ago, more two years ago, but it's just been a phenomenal performer. There's more to say. I've gone too long this answer, but we should talk about how sometimes stocks really are overvalued and do drop, and that's just part of being a shareholder in them. We can go there or anywhere else you'd like to. Ricky Mulvey:Can we finish up with Palantir real quick? Because when you talk about Palantir, there are things that people should know about this company. There is a defense contractor side, and that's something you should know about full well before getting in. Then before our conversation, I was watching the CEO ofWalgreenstalking about his use of Palantir and how it's automating, was it? 384 billion decisions in one day. For the entire enterprise of Walgreens is it can create a digital twin of the organization, and then you can go in and decide what needs stocking, where, and you think about all of the different items and prescriptions going on at a Walgreens and just what a complex logistics operation that is for that pharmacy. He's giving a presentation at a Palantir conference, and you think, this might be a lifetime customer because once Palantir gets in and has access to all of this company data, and you're able to automate decisions and immediately create value for an organization, they might stick with it. But still, for me, I'm not quite as rule breakery as you, David. I'm like, Man. I still think trees can't grow to the sky more than 90 times enterprise value to revenue. I've never seen anything like that before, and that scares me off the stock. David Gardner:Well, I understand. I'm the first to say there are lots of great companies on the market, and if Palantir for whatever reason, doesn't fit your desire or your profile for what you'd like to invest in, there is no compulsion that makes any of us buy any given stock. I will say why I like companies like Palantir but admittedly, you know, it's up about four or five times the value since I first bought. It could be about to drop 50%, as indeed, we saw Nvidia do within the last couple of years, I think, more than once. There's volatility to rule Breaker stocks. For a lot of people, that's not something they're willing to accept. I'm watching Netflix lose two thirds of its value in the face of its self inflicted gunshot wound known as Quickstar more than ten years ago, it's not fun to watch companies lose half or more of their value within inside of one year. But this is often how these companies work because yes, they are premium priced, Ricky. If they stumble, if they make a mistake, if they come short on earnings or announce lowered expectations going forward, even with good results, that can quickly shave a third off of the share price for some of these companies, and that truly is the nature, I would say, of investing in rule breakers. Ricky Mulvey:Stumbles and growth stories are things you have to watch. You mentioned Netflix and another example for them pretty recently they just a few years ago, hard to remember. It was just a few years ago, but when Netflix announced that it lost some subscribers, investors reacted very quickly to that. This was before they really started cracking down on password sharing and really grew the ad business there, and the stock has recovered really nicely since then. But these stumbles can happen, and it can be painful for a long period of time, David. You wanted to talk about valuation, though, because there are times where valuation really matters for the companies you're looking at. What are you specifically talking about there. David Gardner:I think the earlier stage a company is, the less its valuation matters. The later stage it is, the more it matters. Yet I still don't think valuation matters that much overall. I think there's a perception that in order to really be a smart, successful investor, you need to be able to value stocks, and people will ask you questions, insinuating questions, Ricky like, What's your sell discipline? They'll often stare down their pans ne at you and ask you, What is your sell disabled and that would be part of your understanding of valuation. Benjamin Graham himself over the course of his life began to realize that valuation was not really an edge that investors could depend on much anymore. When he first wrote, really, when he came on the scene a century ago, the markets were so inefficient. The knowledge gap between somebody who had a balance sheet and people who couldn't look at the balance sheet or had to wait for the annual report to be mailed to them was substantial. Over the course of the last century, that's largely been erased, and I would say we're living with a pretty efficient market today, which might make it sound like I would think you shouldn't invest in stocks if the market's so efficient. But I say both things out both sides of my mouth. At one side of my mouth I say, the market is extremely efficient. Information is in there. It's coming in from all sides. Looking at the future, the past, and where we are today. If you think you're going to get a real edge by valuing the stock in a way that's radically different from what the market's saying, I think you're probably fooling yourself small enough. I think Benjamin Graham would agree with that. Out the other side of my mouth I want everybody to know that as efficient as the market is, the prices you're seeing right now if you highly disagree with it, go right in and buy or sell and you will for one second affect the price briefly. But there's a huge amount of money just sitting there on the valuations you're seeing every day on the markets. Here's the problem with the efficient market and why we win as investors, because I believe the market's only looking six months forward. Ricky Mulvey:Really? Why is that? David Gardner:I think most managers care about what the next earnings are going to be and the quarter after that. I've harbored this belief after observing for years. Obviously, a lot of people are dialed into things like CNBC or Bloomberg and they're so incredibly short term. We also have algorithms. Most trading today is done by computers and they're trying often to make money inside of a second, literally. That's a lot of the volume that we see on Wall Street. I submit that if you're looking six years ahead instead of six quarters ahead or two quarters ahead which is where I think most of the market is, you will actually be playing almost your own game. What you're seeing are valuations that look in a two quarter period as if they're too high. You wouldn't want to buy any of these rule breaker stocks we've talked about right now based on the next two quarters, but we're missing the five years. There's a great tweet that I saved from former Fool, Joe Magyer who was pulling it fromBank of America. Bank of America did a poll of institutional money managers and said, ''What is your time frame?'' You can check it. This is a few years ago, but it's a Bank of America thing. It's official. It averages to six months. The average institutional manager is playing a six month game which coincidentally happens to be what I arrived at over the course of years just deciding, what are we really doing? The market is incredibly efficient in the very near term and most people are not playing the game that you and I will win which is to buy and to hold the great companies of our time. Ricky Mulvey:What you're talking about reminds me of a story that Aswath Damodaran shared on Motley Fool Money a few years ago known as the Dean Evaluation. He's a professor at New York University, a widely respected investing professor. He went to theBerkshire Hathawayconference a few years back and spoke to a lot of Warren Buffett acolytes and said, ''Who here is trying to replicate what Warren Buffett is doing buy great companies at cheap prices?'' Many of them raised their hand, he said, ''How many of you were beating the market?'' Then he was not invited back to speak to that group, David. The reason is when you only look for cheap stocks, then you miss out on a lot of the big tech players and market-dominating companies that have come to emerge in the stock market. But there are times where not looking at valuation can bite investors and I'm thinking about a story withShopify.This is a company that I own and I'm happy about it, because I just owned it a few years back, and those who have owned it for much longer than me are much happier than I'm. But a lot of people were getting excited about the market in late 2021. I had a friend who bought a lot of Shopify stock and he lost a lot of money on that. For those who bought Shopify at the peaks of 2021, they're still down on that at the height of a recent cycle of investing excitement. After that, he really didn't trust the stock market. I didn't have a great response for him other than that's painful and I don't really begrudge you for wanting to be in index funds only. We're now at a time where the market is close to all time highs once again. I want to caution newer investors especially, how investors can make the experience whenever the next downturn comes less painful especially, if they're following the rule breaker companies that you like to look at. David Gardner:Well I would say, first of all to that friend, keep plugging. It sounds like and this is probably not the full story, Ricky and this is short form audio we're doing. We can't go deeper. We're not seeing his whole portfolio, but I would hope he had more than one stock. To me buying a stock and then having a bad experience with it and then concluding that you shouldn't do that, if it's only one stock is a real unfortunate approach. I think everybody should start with 20 stocks. These days, good news. Commissions are low to zero and you can buy fractional shares. With $1,000, you can have a 20 stock portfolio. I don't believe anybody should determine what they think about the stock market and investing directly in stocks based on one stock. I'm not trying to be unfair to him, I'm sure he had others, but that's how I heard it, so that would be my initial response. Then I would say in terms of Shopify, it is a clear out and out rule breaker. Happy to say, Karl Thiel on our rule breakers team brought that stock to my attention. In February of 2016, our cost is $2.10 for rule breaker members and that includes all of the good and bad times for Shopify, Ricky. Shopify is a 48 bagger for us, but you're right. I'm not sure it's back to its all time highs yet. I think for a lot of us, it's not about a single point in time where you buy a stock. Ideally, you're adding more either to that stock or your portfolio on a regular basis. For me, dollar-cost averaging into stocks directly is the approach everybody should be taking. Let's not make it about the market's high or the market's low, or I'm waiting for a dip? Often I've made the joke, dips wait for dips. That's just a fun side joke that I've made over the years. But I really think we should all just constantly be investing every two weeks if we're wage earners, and adding to the market and the best companies that we can find. I think smoothing out market gyrations and not getting caught up in worrying about market cycles, and simply saving and investing your whole life is going to be such a huge win for everyone listening to us if they but play the game that way. Ricky Mulvey:David, you mentioned brand earlier and you putTeslain that basket, and that's an interesting one to bring up right now. A few months ago there were a lot of people, at least on my Facebook feed saying, I'm shorting Tesla. That was actually probably the worst time to either sell or short the company, but that's still one with a very complicated future. Yes, it was a trailblazer in electric vehicles, but I think many investors could fairly look at Tesla right now and say that its leader Elon Musk has poisoned the brand for quite a lot of people. There are acolytes of Musk and I don't want to dismiss that there are still fans of the company, but for a lot of people what car you drive is a branding mechanism for yourself. As Tesla has become an increasingly political brand, I think there are people in the let's say left and moderate that say, everywhere I drive. I don't want to necessarily promote a political affiliation with that. That harm to the brand may be undoable. Especially as people are making big purchases with electric cars. I guess any reflections on the brand of Tesla right now or what you would say to an investor who thinks, you know what? I'm getting out of Tesla. I don't think this brand is recoverable from what's happened. Is that a short term minded thinker? Is that a long term minded thinker? I don't know. I threw a lot at you. David Gardner:I love that question and I have two responses. My first response is, I believe everybody should be making our portfolio reflect our best vision for our future. I'm the first to say, if somebody has feelings that strongly about Tesla, about electric cars, about the CEO, about the brand, if they don't like it, they don't want to associate with it, I'd be the first to say, don't buy that stock. Or if you had that stock and you just find yourself very disappointed, I certainly have friends who've sold their Tesla. Just disconsolate and just saying, I just don't like what Elon is doing in the world. There are a lot of other people who don't feel that way or really, most people are pretty neutral. There are a lot of people who just know the Tesla brand, may or may not have one, don't even really connect it with Elon Musk. But because you and I are so much part of the news cycle, I think the markets do this to us, we think it's so much bigger and plays so much larger in people's minds than it really does. I'm here to say we absolutely should be making our money reflect our best vision for our future. If Tesla's not there for you, don't do it. For me, it is. I'm not about Elon's politics. There are lots of people who work at Tesla who are widely minded and have lots of different thoughts. I think that Elon is a phenomenal innovator across multiple industries. While he's a little bit of a crazy man and I realize I understand why people wouldn't want him to babysit their kids or wouldn't want him to be the next president of the United States, at the same time let's look at facts and reality. This is a company that created a revolution. Everybody else is still trying to catch up to the electric cars while Tesla is going to start bringing out robots. Robots are a bigger industry than cars and they won't be the only player. But I'm invested, because I love what the company does. I do drive a Tesla and I do so unashamedly. I don't put a bumper sticker on the back saying, please forgive me, I don't like Elon. I'm fine with people doing that. I just don't want to politicize all the things that people want to politicize these days. Let me have a fun quiz for not just you Ricky, but everybody listening. Where was Tesla's stock a year ago this very day with all the brand damage that's been suffered over the course of the last six months in particular, as you might say. Do you want to guess? You don't have to. Ricky Mulvey:I don't have a chart, so I'm not going to cheat on this. I would guess, let me say 250. David Gardner:The stock a year ago, the day we're recording, this conversation is Monday, May 19th was at 175. Today, it's just short of 350. We're talking about a stock that has basically doubled in the face of what you just described as huge headwinds and mistakes and branding problems, etc. I'm not again, a fan of some of the things that Elon has said and done, but I think we're possibly missing the forest for the trees if we're getting too. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about anybody who thinks this is a serious problem and long term damage. I disagree. Ricky Mulvey:I think that listeners hopefully heard a couple of things. One is you have to understand the other side. Who's selling whenever you're buying a stock, but also willingness to have long term conviction, and an idea and ride out the bumps. I appreciate you sharing that. As we move forward, rule breakers can become rule makers. You think about companies former rule breakers, let's say Meta and Alphabet. These are companies now making the rules, practically owning the Internet. A lot of the Mag 7 stocks can be thought about this way. You talked about brand matters more, innovation, ability to change the CEO when these are younger companies. But when a rule breaker becomes a rule maker, does that change how you think about valuation for these companies? David Gardner:It doesn't really. Although again, we're talking about some companies, but not other companies. I love you pointing out that cycle of a rule breaker, the David starting out as David positioning against Goliath and then eventually becoming as Amazon has, the Goliath. Amazon was tiny compared to Walmart when we first recommended it today. It's bigger than Walmart. Yet not every company that goes through that process, rule breaker to rule maker stops growing at that point or keeps growing at that point. I think often there's a perception or expectation. Once you become a rule maker, probably most of your growth is stopped or it's hard to turn that battleship around at this point. It's big bureaucratic things. No doubt there are companies that look like that in some industries, traditionally, and at present. However, in my experience the rule breakers that become rule makers and yet continue to break the rules as they lead their industry, and the world forward are the greatest stocks of our lifetimes. I would say Amazon is a great example. I would say Nvidia is another great example. I would say, so is Netflix, so by the way are lesser known companies like Axon Enterprise or Mercado Libre. These are companies that started out with David positioning and are now within their contexts, the Goliath, and they are innovating at a pace intuitive surgical, same thing. All of surgery may become robotic over the next 20 years. They started out as the only one doing it and right now I can't see any Pepsi to their Coke as surgery continues to get better and transform. It's not just that you stop growing when you're a rule maker or we need to have a new valuation approach. It's the context of the company itself and specifically are they the innovator? I'm always going to have my money on the innovators and I love to find them as early as I can, like we did with Shopify. I'm happy to hold them through some bumps as we have with Shopify. Shopify looks beautifully positioned to me today over the next 20 years. We're going to keep our investments in. Again, Ricky I hasten to add, this is in a world where most money managers are holding for six months where most mutual funds sell out by December 31st of what they owned on January 1st of that year. When investors invest in those funds or just give their money over to the institutions, we are giving our greatest advantage away to Wall Street, the ability to hold and let things grow over time and not be rebalanced out of it or have short term thinkers shifting your money out of the great companies of our time. How many people have I met who said, I once owned Apple but I didn't hold. You could say that with a lot of the companies we've had in this conversation, because most people are simply not investing. They are trading which is the antithesis of investing. I hope what we're doing at the Motley Fool or at least I'll say in my own little corner with the rule breaker part of Motley Fool, we are holding for at least three years, preferably three decades and not any company. We are specifically focused on the rule breakers and the innovators, and I hope that wasn't too long an answer. But I'm just having fun, because I think this is such a profound insight. It's easy to say it's another thing to actually do. But I know many of the people listening to us as Motley Fool members have done this over the course of five or 15 or 25 years along with us, because I get emails from them saying, guys thanks. I just took early retirement because I bought and held Nvidia because you guys did through some thick and some thin. That to me is how to invest.

        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s \"current stock price balances the bull case and the bear case,\" Gil Luria, a stock analyst at investment bank DA Davidson, recently stated on CNBC. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be hurt by an erosion of its revenue from both China and the large cloud-infrastructure players, according to Luria, who has a Hold rating on the stock. \"At least\" 25% of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s chips ultimately end up being used by Chinese entities, Luria reported. With Washington looking to restrict China's use of AI chips, NVDA's China business is likely to weaken, undermining its shares, the analyst indicated. Meanwhile, the major cloud players are raising funds at high interest rates in order to buy NVDA's AI chips, Luria said. If the growth of NVDA's revenue from China and the cloud players slow, analysts' estimates for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could drop, the analyst warned. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "header": "The Stock Market Could Make Big Moves This Week Following Critical News on Nvidia, Interest Rates, and Inflation",
        "content": "TheS&P 500(^GSPC2.05%)has rebounded 18% since hitting bottom in early April after President Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. The index rocketed higher on Tuesday, May 27, as trade tensions eased between the European Union and the United States. But the stock market still faces several hurdles this week. Specifically,Nvidia(NVDA3.07%)will announce its first-quarter financial results after the market closes on Wednesday, May 28, and the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes from its May meeting earlier that same day. Then the Commerce Department will release PCE inflation and consumer spending data for April on Friday, May 30. Here's what investors should know. Nvidia will report its earnings results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 on Wednesday, May 28. The company guided for 65% sales growth and 49%non-GAAP(generally accepted accounting principles) net income growth. But many analysts have downwardly revised their estimates during the last three months due to concerns about chip export restrictions and tariffs. The Wall Street consensus currently implies earnings will increase 44% to $0.88 per diluted share. Investors should pay close attention togross margin. Nvidia's gross margin narrowed three percentage points to 73.5% in the fourth quarter, and company guidance says that number will contract further to 71% in the first quarter. Gross margin can be a proxy for pricing power, and Nvidia's has been slipping due to the costly ramp-up of itsBlackwell GPU. CFO Colette Kress says gross margin should return to the mid-70% range \"late this fiscal year.\" Importantly, options traders are currently pricing in a good amount of volatility post-earnings. The market expects Nvidia stock to move about 6% after the report, which implies a closing share price between $123 and $140 on the next day. An earnings beat is no guarantee Nvidia shares will move higher. If management gives a gloomy outlook concerning export restrictions or tariffs, the stock could drop. And that downward momentum could spread to othersemiconductor stocksandtechnology stocks. Image source: Getty Images. TheFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the policymaking arm of theFederal Reserve, concluded its latest two-day meeting on May 7. Officials left thebenchmark interest rateunchanged, but the minutes from the meeting will be published on Wednesday, May 28. Importantly, the minutes from the March meeting detailed concerns abouttariffs imposed by President Trump, saying: \"Participants assessed that the uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased, with almost all participants viewing risks to inflation as tilted to the upside and risks to employment as tilted to the downside.\" Those conditions -- rising prices in combination with higher unemployment and slower economic growth -- are symptoms ofstagflation. Numerous economists have warned tariffs will lead to stagflation, and the market is especially worried about that outcome because it would be a no-win situation for the Federal Reserve. Policymakers could cut interest rates to support the labor market and prevent a recession, but lower rates would make inflation worse. Alternatively, policymakers could raise interest rates to curb inflation, but higher rates would further suppress economic growth and lead to greater unemployment. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have not yet had a material impact on the economy, but investors will undoubtedly scrutinize the minutes from the FOMC's May meeting for insight into what Fed officials expect in the coming months. Any bad news could send stocks lower, but reassuring news could give the market a boost. The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. Unlike theConsumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation based on urban consumers' out-of-pocket spending, the PCE price index includes urban and rural consumers, as well as spending done on consumers' behalf. For instance, health insurance paid by an employer on behalf of employees would only show up in PCE inflation. The Commerce Department will release updated PCE figures at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, May 30. The consensus estimate says PCE prices rose 2.2% year over year in April 2025. If accurate, that would be the lowest number since 2.1% in September 2024. Stocks could swing lower if the actual reading is materially higher than the consensus because it would suggest tariffs are causing price increases across the economy. The Commerce Department will also release consumer spending data at the same time. The consensus estimate says consumer spending rose 0.2% month over month in April 2025. If accurate, that would be the lowest number since 0% in January 2025. Stocks could swing lower if the actual reading is materially lower because it would suggest tariffs are causing consumers to spend less, and consumer spending is the largest driver ofeconomic growth.",

        "content": "One of the most-anticipated days of the second quarter has arrived. Amid a flurry of economic data and President Donald Trump regularly changing his administration's tariff and trade policies, Wall Street'sartificial intelligence (AI)darlingNvidia(NVDA3.07%)is set to report its fiscal 2026 first-quarter operating results after the closing bell today (May 28). A lot of investors tend to focus on the bread-and-butter headline numbers, which includes Nvidia's revenue andearnings per share (EPS)for the fiscal first quarter, as well as its second-quarter and full-year guidance. These headline figures often provide an extremely quick way for investors to size up how a company performed and/or will perform moving forward. But if you're just awaiting Nvidia's sales and EPS figures, you'll be missing the big picture. One beneath-the-surface operating metric is whathas the potential to make or break Nvidia stock on May 28. Image source: Getty Images. Heading into 2023, Nvidia was a reasonably important tech company with a $360 billion market cap that was prominently known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-performance gaming and cryptocurrency mining. As of this writing, it's a $3.3 trillion juggernaut that's arguably the most-important tech stock on the planet. For more than two years, Nvidia's Hopper (H100) GPU and successor Blackwell GPUs have been the backbone of AI-accelerated data centers. Combined, these two chipsaccount for the lion's share of GPUs currently deployed in high-compute data centers. But Nvidia isn't winning solely because of its market share -- it's excelling due to the law of supply and-demand. Businesses eager to build out their AI-data center infrastructure have found AI-focused GPUs are in short supply. Even with world-leading chip fabricatorTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingexpanding its production capacity at a breakneck pace, demand for Nvidia's chips continue to swamp their supply. When demand for a good or service outpaces supply, it's expected that the price of said good or service will rise until demand tapers. Nvidia has had little issue raising its prices andcharging two to four times more per chip than its external rivals. That's excellent news for the company's sales and profits. Nvidia's innovation has helped keep it (and its stock) atop the pedestal, as well. CEO Jensen Huang aims to bring a more powerful and energy-efficient chip to market annually through 2027. Following the Hopper and Blackwell are Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin, and Vera Rubin Ultra, the latter two of which will be run on a new processor. No external competitors are particularly close to dethroning Nvidia in terms of compute abilities. Image source: Getty Images. Based on what recent history has shown, Nvidia has a better-than-average chance of surpassing Wall Street's consensus sales and EPS forecast for the fiscal first quarter. Nvidia has topped analysts' consensus EPS forecast for nine consecutive quarters. But there's another metric that tells a more comprehensive story about Nvidia's operating health: its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin. Gross margin(also called \"gross profit margin\") is a simple calculation of revenue remaining (expressed as a percentage) after deducting for cost of goods sold. For example, if you brought in $100 in sales and your cost of goods was $20, your gross margin would be 80% (100 \u2013 20 = 80, and (80/100 X 100) = 80%). Nvidia's GAAP gross margin soared after the Hopper became the hottest thing since sliced bread. Being able to charge more than $40,000 per chip in early 2024 sent its GAAP gross margin to a peak of 78.4% during the fiscal 2025 first quarter, which in turn helped Nvidia's net income skyrocket.  NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. However, Nvidia's GAAP gross margin has changed course since the comparable quarter one year ago (all quarters based on Nvidia's fiscal year, which ends in late January): To be objective, a GAAP gross margin of 70.6% would still about 500 basis points higher than where Nvidia's gross margin had been vacillating at the high-end over the previous 10 years before the AI boom. Further, the company is generating considerably more in net sales now than it was even one year ago when it had a 78.4% GAAP gross margin. Nevertheless,a trend is being set -- and not an encouraging one. Nvidia's (expected) four-quarter decline in GAAP gross margin looks to be directly related to increasing competition in AI-accelerated data centers. While some of this competition is external, what's more worrisome for Nvidia is thatmany of its core customers by net sales are developing their own AI-GPUsand AI solutions. Even though these internally developed chips and solutions can't hold water next to the compute potential of Nvidia's hardware, they're considerably cheaper and not backlogged. In other words, it's a recipe for Nvidia to lose out on future data center real estate. The heart of the problem for Nvidia is that this combination of external and internal competition is steadily (pardon the apropos pun)chipping away at its biggest advantage: its pricing power. Wall Street's AI darling has relied on AI-GPU scarcity to charge an exorbitant premium for its Hopper and Blackwell chips. With this scarcity now diminishing, and expected to wane in future quarters, there's the real possibility of Nvidia's pricing power fading. Chances are that we're already witnessing this in the company's GAAP gross margin decline. When Nvidia reports its fiscal first quarter results after the bell on May 28,its GAAP gross margin will tell the tale. If its second quarter GAAP gross margin forecast points higher than what's reported for the first quarter, Nvidia stock can breathe new life. But if the forecast calls for a fifth consecutive quarterly decline in GAAP gross margin, Nvidia stock could have further to fall.",

        "header": "Where Will AMD's Stock Be In 3 Years? The Answer May Surprise You.",
        "content": "AMD(AMD3.87%)isn't a bad company by any means, but if there was ever a company that could fit the saying, \"always a bridesmaid and never the bride,\" it would be AMD. AMD always seems to be in second place, regardless of the trend. In the early 2000s, AMD was getting smoked byIntel(NASDAQ: INTC)in the CPU game during the massive PC buildout, and it was said that AMD was only allowed to exist so Intel wouldn't be accused of being an illegal monopoly. Fast-forward to today, and the biggest computing trend to ever occur, the AI arms race, also has AMD playing second fiddle to another competitor,Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). However, AMD is still doing OK in this trend, but its market share is nowhere near Nvidia's. Still, if the market has priced AMD's stock at a level reflecting its second-place status, it could be worth owning. Despite its trailing position, will it be a winning investment over the next three years? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. AMD hasn't fared as well in the AI arms race because of how broad a company it is. While Nvidia has all its resources focused on designing the bestgraphics processing units (GPUs)possible, AMD is more stretched across multiple categories. AMD now splits its business segment into three units (previously, it was four): Of these three divisions, the data center is performing the best, although its embedded division has an excellent operating margin. Data source: AMD. YOY = Year over Year. While that's a bit of a mixed bag of results, considering how much larger the data center, client, and gaming divisions are than the embedded division, AMD's overall growth rate fared quite well, with revenue increasing 36% year over year. However, that growth rate isn't expected to last, with Wall Street analysts projecting 27% revenue growth in Q2 and 23% for 2025. For AMD to prove itself a worthy investment option, it needs to maintain its growth outperformance, but it seems to be trending in the wrong direction. Even looking out into 2026, it projects the same thing, with 17% revenue growth. However, revenue isn't all investors should look at, especially with a mature business like AMD. AMD's margins have been under fire for the last few years, but that seems to be turning around.  AMD Profit Margindata byYCharts AMD's margins are quickly ticking up, and Wall Street is anticipating this. As a result, they expect strong earnings growth over the next few years, with the average analyst projecting $5.71 inearnings per share (EPS) for 2026, up from the $1.38 it has posted over the past 12 months. So, when valuing AMD's stock, investors need to consider this expansion rather than looking at trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) metrics (AMD trades for an expensive 81 times trailing earnings). Currently, AMD trades for about28 times forward earnings,which seems a bit expensive.  AMD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts However, if you value AMD from FY 2026 projected earnings ($5.71), it trades for 19.3 times forward earnings. This margin expansion goal is high on CEO Lisa Su's priority list and could propel AMD's stock to outperform over the next three years. AMD isn't going to outgrow or deliver better GPUs than Nvidia. Still, if it can work toward expanding its profit margin and is successful, it could be an incredibly successful investment and dramatically outperform many of its peers (including Nvidia).",

Veteran financial commentator, CNBC\u2019sJim Cramer,is sounding an alarm for investors, suggesting that the performance of tech giantsApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) andNvidia Corp.(NASDAQ:NVDA) this week will be a critical indicator for the broader market\u2019s health. What Happened:In a recent post on X, Cramer urged followers to \u201cWatch Apple. If it doesn\u2019t go up as much as the market, really bad sign for key holding.\u201d His warning extends to Nvidia, which is set to report earnings this week on Wednesday, stating, \u201cSame with Nvidia as it reports this week.\u201d Trending: Start investing with eToro's CopyTrader \u2014mirror top-performing traders with no management fees, and receive a $10 bonus when you deposit $100 today. Cramer\u2019s comments highlight the significant influence these two companies, often considered market \u201cbellwethers,\u201d wield over overall investor sentiment and portfolio performance. On Friday, Trump demanded that iPhones sold in the U.S. be manufactured domestically, threatening a 25% tariff otherwise.  These remarks directly targetedApple\u2019s growing presence in India, specifically Foxconn orHon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd.\u2019s (OTCPK: HNHPF) construction of a $1.5 billion display module facility near Chennai. Meanwhile, according toBenzinga Pro, analysts expect Nvidia to report earnings per share of $0.88 for the first quarter, a 43% increase from the prior year, while its revenue is projected at $43.4 billion, up 65% from a year ago.

Why It Matters:Adding to the cautious tone, Cramer also noted a challenging environment for new investments, stating, \u201cNow the futures are officially so high that you can\u2019t buy anything that\u2019s up big.\u201d This suggests that current market valuations are stretched, making it difficult for investors to find attractive entry points for stocks that have already seen significant gains.

Trader Talk with Kenny Polcarion Yahoo Finance delivers expert analysis and actionable insights, empowering you to navigate market volatility and secure your financial future. This post was written by Langston Sessoms. Welcome to Trader Talk where we dish out the latest Wall Street buzz to keep your portfolio sizzling. I'm Kenny Polcari coming to you live from the iconic New York Stock Exchange, a place that had been my home for decades and still fuels the pulse of capitalism, entrepreneurship, and freedom. Now let's jump into my big take for the week. Turn on the TV, open the.YouTube, scroll your feed, and there are all the financial gurus shouting predictions with god-like confidence. Stocks to buy now, crash warnings, millionaire blueprints. They look slick, they talk fast, they package themselves as shortcut to riches. But here's the truth. No one likes to say it out loud. Most of these gurus aren't in the markets. They're in marketing.The more certain someone sounds about the future of the market, the less you should trust them because real investors, those who've spent decades in the trenches, don't speak in absolutes. They speak in probabilities. They know no one can predict the market consistently and they certainly don't promise you guaranteed returns in exchange for a subscription fee.Why does this work? Because uncertainty is uncomfortable. So when someone steps up and says, I've cracked the code, people listen. Even when it's snake oil wrapped in financial jargon, even when they're selling fear, or worse, hope.But real investing is messy. It's slow. It's full of risk and mistakes and adjustments. There's no cheating code, just hard earned discipline. Bottom line, if someone's selling you an illusion of certainty, they're not a guru, they're a sales person. You don't need louder voices. You need clearer thinking. Trust the process, not the pitch.OK, joining us today is my friend Chris Versace, chief investment officer at Tomatica Research, where he leads the development of thematic investing that aligned portfolios with powerful long-term trends like digital transformation, aging demographics, and the rise of the connected consumer. Chris is also the co-author of Cocktail Investing.And a veteran equity analyst with a deep background in technology, consumer, and industrial sectors. He spent years helping investors understand how big picture shifts translate into actionable stock ideas. Please join me in welcoming Chris Versace. Chris, it is a pleasure to have you here at the New York Stock Exchange, a place for me that feels like home. I'mI'm so happy to be here, Kenny. You are right. We have known each other for some time. I just hope that I live up to that very niceintroduction. Absolutely live up. But let's start by talking about thematic investing and what thematic research is. So, so educate the crowd just a little bit about, about what itis. So I got started a long time ago. I mean, I, I almost hate to say how long ago at this point.Um, just as a regular sell side equity analyst, and you know, I wound up covering a certain sector, right, where you're responsible for understanding the puts the takes, the industry does everything about that sector that sector, only that sector, and at times you're in favor, you're out of favor, but as I was doing this, I kind of sat back and said, you know, there are things happening here.That if I don't have a vertical approach, if I took a horizontal approach, boy, can I connect the dots and get something pretty interesting so this started to give rise to this thematic framework where we look for the shifting landscapes of economics, demographics, psychographics, technology, regulatory mandates when they happen, and what we're trying to identify structural change and the.Companies that are poised to benefit from them. Not all companies are. Some companies will they get left behind? You bet they will, but that's really to us what thematic investing is about. It's about identifying structural change. OK, but so does it really work in today's environment, today's technology environment? Like give me an example. Talk to me about how you would maybe create a thematic portfolio. Uh, well, let's see. We haven't created one in a little bit of time, but we actually have about 2 dozen thematic models that we have. Everything from aging of population, AI, digital infrastructure. Are they ETFs or are they just? These are just models. We do individualnames with a basket of 6.To 8 names, but we also have taken some of these strategies into Europe where we've got some ETFs as well. One is cybersecurity, the other is sustainable future of food. We had a few others, you know, at one point in time, but those are the two that we have now with our partners overthere, right? So, are you, is, is, is Tamatica.Uh, a consumer, like, like, is the retail investor gonna go to you or is it an institutional? So I would say that today it's primarily, um, institutional clients and RIAs, butAnd I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. But if we talk, Kenny, let's say, 2nd half of the year, 4th quarter, we might have something to share. That's interesting. I look forward to that. I'd look because now, you know, I've, I've, I left my years here at the New York Stock Exchange, of which I will say it was 4 decades. Uh, that sounds better than 40 years.For decades sounds better. But I left after being an institutional broker servicing the institutional community, and now I sit on the other side, right? So I'm the chief market strategist at Slate's Ow Wealth, which is an independent RAA, uh, so I'd be very interested to hear what you have to say come towards the end of the year. So let's just make sure we mark our calendars already done.All right, so let's talk about, let's talk about the markets. So let's talk about this recent recovery. We had to sell off in April after liberation Day, and many of us got liberated from our money. I like to say, right? But, but some of it's come back. In fact, you see some of the, some of those names that got absolutely crushed are actually higher today than they were on April 2nd. And so the market has rebounded a little bit. Tell me, first of all, before we get into the Moody's downgrade and, and China's now kind of maybe pull back on this whole 90 day thing.Uh, that they announced this morning, but talking about where you think the market istoday just as we're sitting here. So, you know, coming out of last week, you know, if we look at the relative strength index levels, S&P 500 flirting with overbought NASDAQ back in overboard territory, not surprising, right? Not at all. We've had huge runs in both of those market indices, but we don't buy the market, right? We pay attention. We're mindful of the market and where it is, but you know, we're continuing to look for names that are well.Position based on some of our themes and others that we can be opportunisticin, right? So what I always love is when someone asks me, is it too late? Is it too late for me to get in the market? Is it too late? I go, it's never too late to get into the market. A, because there's always opportunity, but B, tell me where you are in your life cycle. Are you talking about getting in the market for a month or 5 years? Because then there's always opportunity in the market. Yeah, I think that's right. I think you got to be mindful though of not there's not.Always as much opportunity at any particular time and I think after the rise that we've seen, right, if you were able to put, you know, money to work like I co-manage or manage, I should say, the street's pro portfolio, uh, basket.com's pro portfolio, correct, right. Thank you. And it's a it's a real portfolio, 25 stocks, sometimes more, sometimes less is it a range of sectors? Uh, it leverages some of the thematics that we have thematico and some other areas that we want, um, purposeful.Exposure. That's what I will say. We're not as broad-based as the S&P 500. We don't have to have exposure in every sector, right? We want companies that are poised to outperform the market in, in whatever sectors you're at. So on that portfolio of the 11 major S&P sectors, what are you representing? Oh,good God, you know, I don't think of it that way. I, I, I, I hate to shatter that thought. And, and, and the reason I say that is if you get back to thematics, right? You know, think of a company like Amazon.What's the, what's the sector? What's the rightsector? Yeah, right. You're right, could fall in a bunch of different sectors, right, right, or, or Apple these days, or even Disney, you could argue, right? So I, I try not to get caught up in that. So what's the biggest in your mind currently? What's kind of the biggest theme out there that, that investors and, and, and, and traders should know about? We're not gonna break any new ground with this, with this revelation, but I would say that today we'reWe stand, especially coming out of where we were, you know, 68 weeks ago and the potential going forward, it's going to be AI and I say that largely because, yes, we know about Nvidia and Marvel and all these other companies, but I also think about connecting the dots and the ripple effects, right? So if we think about the demand for data center, the construction of data center, we think about people, you know, sometimes people aren't thinking like that. No, no, I know, I know. And it's, I like one of my favorite things to do, not, not, not to get sidetracked is when you go through earnings season and you read all the transcripts and you pick up all these data points and you literally connect the dots, right? So it's, you know, there's the stock that you want, there's the, you know, math major, 1st, 1st, 1st derivative, second derivative, and sometimes you can use those data points.Up and down, right? So it's, I just love doing that. I find it very helpful. So I try to do that when we invest in the portfolio, but also tie it back to our themes as well. So for example, if we're going to build all these data centers, right, you need equipment to build them. You need electricity to power them. So, you know, if you were to say, well, Chris, it sounds like you might be long, you know, I rentals or Vulcan materials or eaten.And waste management has to haul all this crap away. Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Well, what about names like Dominion and CEG that are getting into the nuclear space, right? Because the utilities. Now nuclear is interesting, right? So we own the, the Van Ek, um, I'll botch this name, but it's the Vanek uranium and nuclear ETF, and we have a nuclear model over at Tomatica. Now you need to be careful with this, right, because I want to benefit from companies.And the spending they have. So when I think about Dominion Power, Duke Energy, the utilities, uh, at least as it relates to building out the electrical grid, they're spenders. So I'm not gonna buy them, right? It's almost like if you want to, um, buy the 5G build out, you're not gonna buy AT&T because they need to spend to build the network. I wanna.By the companies that are benefiting from that spending, that kind of brings us back to Eaton and there are some other names out there, that's interesting. I hadn't thought about it that way, right? That's why we're talking. That's why we're talking. I appreciate that. Wait, so talk to me also about quantum computing. Is that a theme at all that that makes sense or does it not yet? You know, it's um.There's a lot of potential themes out there, right? And you kind of need to hit a tipping point, right? And there's sometimes there are individual stocks that are going to be disruptive, but there's not, there's not a fully baked comprehensive theme out there. So like I'll give you an example. 11 of the companies that we own in the portfolio is Universal Display. They help manufacture the key chemicals that go into organic light emitting diode displays.And we're seeing widespread adoption. Wait, what kind of displays organic light emitting diodes, excuse me, or OLED displays. Your iPhone has it. You're gonna start seeing them in a lot more places. OLED display called OLED OLEDs, yeah, so you.TVs, smartphones, tablets, um, and a growing, uh, array of automotive interior lighting displays there, and I think even United in their new Polaris cabin is having some nice OLED displaysas well. So hold that thought one minute because we, we'll be right back after this short break.All right, so let's go back to talking about the old because that's fascinating to me. So talk to me about what's different, what, what makes that different than the displays maybe 5 yearsago. Oh, so you're talking against LCDs or liquid crystal displays. Couple of different things. One, organic light emitting diodes, they are individual pixels, right? So you can.Get deeper blacks, which is great for TVs and, and all of that. Uh, you definitely do, do you, you would pop on the display, right? So there's that, right? But then at the same time, because it's or light emitting diode, there it's actually less uh power consumption.And it allows for thinner displays and as we're we'll probably see more of foldable displays. So you've looked, you think of Samsung's Galaxy folding their phones, right, that's that. Apple is rumored to have one of those in the next few years, foldable tablets, you know, this is kind of where it's going, and Universal is a key company.In that it supplies chemicals to all the major display manufacturing companies. That's what's it, Universal Universal display ticker symbol, OLED OLED. Yeah, that's interesting. I had not, I hadn't even heard about these displays. I think that's great. I'll have to take a look. Yeah. Wait, let me ask you another question. You made another point is that these displays use less energy, less power, and, and they're thinner, right? That's why you like if you notice howThin smartphones have become, you may not notice it's got a case on them, but you pull off the case, you see how thin they are. You see how thin, uh, Apple's new iPad Pros are compared to other iPads, the display. My iPads, I guess 3 years old or so time to upgrade, Danny, but it's pretty thin, but it is in a, it's in a case itself. No, no Apple Intelligence in that device. I know that, but there's Apple Intelligence in my iPhone, you know what I mean. Speaking about the intelligence, I have to tell you, have you used Grok? You know, I have used a lot of them, but not Gronk. I, I, I, I think Gronk, listen, I, I think they're all good, but Gronk for some reason.Feels better to me. Like when I, when I use it, it just feels better like it, the data it it produces and the, I don't know where its sources are, um, but it just feels well, that's the key though, right? I mean, 100% it's all about the array of data that it can tap. And if you think of all that, you know, X or Twitter, whatever you want to call it has, that's a tremendous amount of information.To mine for 100%, but I, I will say this though, that's also why I don't think you can rule Google out when you think of what they have in search and YouTube. Yeah, no, I don't know. I agree with you. I think the whole thing is fascinating and I think Chat GBD does a great job. Uh, and, you know, when it first started, I was using Chat GBT. For for recipes? No, no, no, when I would ask it a question if I need to clarify something, uh, but you can use it to clarify a recipe. Do you know what else you can do withthat? You can make a recipe, get your ingredients, and then you can export it to Instacart. OK, you can. Yes, you can. There's a tool you have to get, but you can do it. Oh, no way. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's interesting. I never thought about that. Anyway, what I'll tell you is that, so then when I, when they put crack on the Twitter grok on the Twitter platform.Um, and you're a premium user, then it, you know, the little buttons right there at the bottom and you, you pop it open. Here's the only thing I'll say is if I ask it one question and I'm still in that same thread and then I ask it a different question, it'll tie it, it'll try to tie the second question to the first question and keep the theme going when it's two separate thoughts. And so I always have to.You know, check out and then check back in and start a new thread so that it doesn't, it doesn't continue to try to create that same. I think you should tell Elon this. Yeah, well, OK, Elon, listen. All right, so let's talk about is there hype or what's real and this whole AI thing that he's now done in that Trump did, he just came back from the Mideast, had some massive conversations with some of the some of theYeah, the country, United Arab Emirates, uh, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, uh, that they are, they are all plunging deep into AI, building massive data centers over there in the middle of the desert. Uh, does that concernyou? Concern? I don't think that's the right word. I think that, you know, why would we think that AI and the data center build out is only to be right.So that that's the way I think about it, you know, technology is global, right? We're we're not the only country with smartphones, right? So I, I'm not surprised that this is going to happen. I think it's got some great implications. Um, you know, again, a lot of the names that we just talked about, some, some of them on the construction side are more US based, but if we think about Nvidia, Marvel, and the like, this is great. Yeah, no, I, I think there'll be huge beneficiaries of what's going on.I mean, especially if you hear the, you know, the conversation, the commitments kind of what they're looking to do, and they want to be a player in the space and they should be, right? But back it up too though. So, you know, a couple of months ago, I think, um, Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong said, oh, I see a $1 trillion build out in data center. This is all part of that. 100%. And, and I think we'll hear more from other countries, you know, over time. And I, and I suspect that asWe use AI more as it gets um in the enterprise more more devices, right? What's gonna happen? You're gonna need more data centers. You're gonna need to upgrade the digital infrastructure, but it's more energy demand, they talk about wane, energy demand is not waning. I think there's a massive oversupply of, of energy, which is fine, but I don't think demand is waning at all. I don't.I mean if we're talking electrical energy, 100% right just not happening. Right, let's talk real quick about kind of we came through the first quarter or growing, I think they're growing what about 15% year over year. Is that what the number was, uh, it's so full year 2025, right? That's what you're talking about. Well, what the first quarter? Oh, the first quarter, yeah, I think, I think that's somewhere up in the double digits. Yes, yeah, I think that's right. What do you think about the second quarter now? Uh,well, I'm a little more concerned about the 2nd quarter. Yeah, well, we'll see the full impact of tariffs, right? We'll see potential price retailers are gonna come out, you know, any day now soon. They're gonna start to report. So it's gonna be interesting, you know, uh, uh, the Walmart CEO made that comment about passing on these price hikes, these tariffs on the consumers, and Trump right away, you know, I saw that. Well, it wasn't even that though. You remember a couple of weeks ago where Amazon was going to list the impact of tariffs and the administration got on, got on them and they backpedaled pretty, you know, the argument was, why didn't you do that during the Biden years when inflation was running at 9 9.4%. Why didn't you break it out and show what that impact was? I think that'sa little harder to quantify than thantariffs. OK, it might be, except prices were going up every month. Prices are going up. I mean Paris, they're gonna go up once and then adjust. No one's arguing about what happened during the Biden years. We all know we all lived through my wallet was a little lighter. So, but, but again, I think companies are responding to this because they, you know, people are concerned. And I, and I, and I understand that. But I also think though that if we, the concern I have is this, OK.When was the last time you went to the grocery store, Kenny, and you got a box of cereal or you got a box or bag of coffee and prices were going up and then those prices you were paying came down as other prices and pressures came down. I haven't seenit yet. It doesn't happen. I haven't seen it yet. Yeah, I go to the, I go to the, I go shopping. I listen, I know little secret. I love to go groceries. So do I. I don't know what it is. It's like a treasure. I love to go grocery. It's a treasure hunt. Yeah, yeah. So I haven't seen that yet. Yeah, you're never gonna see it. Just like a pound of coffee, just like a pound of coffee comes in a 10 to 12 ounce bag and a pound of coffee last time I thought was supposed to 16 ounces. Yeah, right. They do the same thing with peanut butter, that you know they put that hole in the bottom of the of the of the jar a little bit bigger. It's less peanut butter, so it's the same price. I get it, you know, but I just, I, I, I think it's, I think unless there's a full blown recessions.Then I don't think you're gonna see prices come down. They'll stop going up and then once again, people just kind of get used to it, right? So just hoping that wages start to increase. Right. So what I'm wondering just about retailers, so near term, I, I think there's gonna be a little bit of pain for them, right? I think we're gonna have to watch their margins. We're gonna have to see, are they gonna announce further price increases? I think they will. What's the impact of what we've seen, uh, at the ports and, you know, supply shortages in the short term, butIf we do get these trade deals and tariffs are ultimately brought lower, then the question becomes, does the price go? They don't. And if they don't, what does that mean for their margins? Margins go back up, right. Butif they don't, if the, if the tariff deals are not necessarily as onerous as they were made out to be, and it doesn't look like, by the way, that it's, that's gonna happen.I think they're not gonna be as onerous as that's thegoal. The goal is to reset global trade. That's right, which I think is OK. I think it's OK to have these conversations and renegotiate trade agreements that are decades old. The world changes. So I, so I have no problem with that. But if they're not as onerous, if some of these companies started raising prices and then the, the tariffs aren't nearly as bad, to your point, are they gonna come down? Is Trump gonna call people out and say, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's a greatquestion. Great question. I don't know. I mean, because.And this is, this is not a popular thought, but ultimately, companies are responsible to their shareholders 100%, right? So if they've, if they can improve their profits and drive their EPS, which I think is exactly Walmart's not responding. Walmart's responding to their shareholders. They're not responding, you know, they're not saying they're going to raise prices because they're trying to stick it. They want to maintain their margins for their shareholders. I mean, let's, let's, let's call for whatever it is, no, no, 100%, right?Anyway, listen, it, it has been a pleasure. I, I hope we get to do this again. I want you to come back in 3 or 4 months and revisit this whole conversation. I look forward to it. We're going to see what they're doing over in the Mideast, what's happened here in the United States, what tariffs have and have not done, and kind of where we stand. And maybe we'll have some thematic stuff to talk about. I hope so. In the meantime, you know, I, I end every, uh, podcast with a recipe. And so today it's spring now in New York City. It's spring across America. So I want to introduce the spring pasta. Now this pasta.It is a vibrant celebration of the season, right? It's featuring an al dente Ditalini pasta tossed with tender asparagus, sweet peas, and sauteed leeks and shallots, a creamy sauce born from mascarpone cheese, a basil pesto, and fresh parmigiana. It coats every single bite. You add a splash of lemon juice to just awaken all the flavors. Pair that with a chilled glass of Pino Grigio. My favorite is Santa Margarita, and it's a fresh, elegant dish that captures the essence of every.spring in every mouthful. You can scan the QR code on the screen for the full recipe and you'll thank me later. Now look, that's a wrap for today's trader talk, but the conversation keeps going.

        "content": "(Reuters) -Futures for Canada's main stock index edged lower on Wednesday, pulling back from the previous session's record high, as investors awaited trade-related developments and chip giant Nvidia's quarterly results later in the day. June futures on the S&P/TSX index were down 0.4% at 6:16 a.m. ET (1016 GMT). Nvidia is expected to report a 66.2% surge in first-quarter revenue, according to data compiled by LSEG; investors will be scrutinizing the AI bellwether's spending levels. Canada's main stock index rose on Tuesday after recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar sent a potential signal that investors are growing more confident investing in the domestic market. The TSX is set for a robust monthly gain, as easing global trade concerns boosted risk appetite. Markets have been optimistic after trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe eased, with U.S.President Donald Trumpdelaying tariffs on the EU until July 9 to allow for negotiations between the White House and the 27-nation bloc. Looking ahead, minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting in early May, U.S. PCE data for April and Statistics Canada's first-quarter GDP data are scheduled to be released later this week. In commodities, gold prices firmed and oil prices held steady on Wednesday, while industrial metals were subdued. In corporate news, Definity Financial Corporation has agreed to acquire most of Travelers Canada for C$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion), making it the fourth largest property and casualty (P&C) insurer in Canada.

        "header": "Is Nvidia a Millionaire-Maker Stock?",
        "content": "Over the last few decades, the American technology sector has made boatloads of millionaires -- not only for founders and CEOs, but also for the thousands of regular people who work at these companies or buy their stock. With shares up by over 23,000% over the last decade,Nvidia(NVDA3.07%)is the quintessential example of this phenomenon. But as we all know, past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. And witha market capof $3.2 trillion, Nvidia is already one of the largest companies on Earth, giving it less room to grow. Let's dig deeper to see what the future might bring for this legendary chipmaker. While Nvidia started its life focusing on consumer video game graphics and cryptocurrency mining, both of those once-core operations have become totally overshadowed bygenerative AI. As of the fourth quarter, the data center segment (where Nvidia accounts for sales of cutting-edge AI chips) represented a jaw-dropping 91% of its $39.3 billion in sales for the period. This level of concentration means that a large portion of Nvidia's valuation is tied to the prospects of this one industry. If AI tech exceeds expectations, so will Nvidia. But if the sector falls flat, well -- you know the drill. Right now, it still feels too early to know how things will play out. Analysts atJeffriesseem wildly optimistic. Their research suggests that three-quarters of businesses already use generative AI in at least one function, and they expect it to drive $1.1 trillion in revenue by 2028. But investors shouldn't necessarily take these projections at face value. Even if AI becomes a part of mainstream life, there is no guarantee that big profits will follow. And this puts Nvidia's clients in a tough spot. Despite the hype, generative AI remains wildly unprofitable. While giants likeAlphabetandMeta Platformscan hide their AI losses within their vast research and development budgets, the scale of the problem is much clearer with pure-play AI companies like OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. The Economistreports that while the start-up's 2024 revenue tripled to $3.7 billion, losses ballooned to $5 billion. And while OpenAI's management believes it can achieve $12 billion in cash flow by 2029, this is far from guaranteed due to the intense competition in the industry. Chinese open-source rival DeepSeek shows that competitive AI models can be created (arguably) at a fraction of the cost of their U.S. counterparts, which means early leaders may not have much of aneconomic moat, especially when the technology matures and the rate of model improvement slows. If profit potential shrinks, so will the market for Nvidia's expensive hardware. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia will also face challenges on the hardware side of the industry as companies seek to diversify their supply chains. In April, the Trump administration effectively banned the company from selling its h20 chips to Chinese clients. While Nvidia has already started work on a new compliant chip, it is unclear if Chinese companies will be willing to build their businesses around Nvidia hardware, given the unpredictability of U.S. regulations. Rivals likeHuaweiare working to take market share. Nvidia is a big player in a potentially transformational industry, so there is little doubt it can continue to outperform the market over the long term (even though there will be short-term volatility). That said, the easy money has already been made. New investors shouldn't expect this legendary chipmaker to repeat the multibagger returns it enjoyed over the previous decades. You can attribute the slower progress to the challenging dynamics on both the software and hardware sides of the AI industry.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials) ispreparing to report quarterly earningson Wednesday, May 28, with investor focus centered on the fallout from new U.S. export restrictions targeting the company's H20 chip. The AI-focused chipmaker announced a $5.5 billion inventory write-down for the China-specific H20, which analysts at BNP Paribas estimate could translate into a $15 billion revenue hit over the next 12 months. The write-down is being called the largest in semiconductor industry history. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. For the quarter ending in April, analysts expect Nvidia to post revenue of $43.28 billion, up 66% year over year. While this still dwarfs growth among other megacap tech peers, it marks a significant deceleration from the more than 250% growth recorded during the same period last year. Full-year growth is projected at 53%, indicating a cooling trajectory despite Nvidia's dominant position in AI chip sales. The H20 chip was designed to meet earlier U.S. export restrictions under the Biden administration, but a new directive from the Trump administration issued on April 9 imposed tighter licensing requirements. Reports suggest Nvidia's leadership was surprised by the move, having believed the chip would be permitted for export. CEO Jensen Huang recently disclosed that Nvidia's market share of GPUs in China has fallen from 95% to 50% under the new restrictions. In fiscal 2024, Nvidia recorded $17.1 billion in revenue from customers with Chinese addresses, including those in Hong Kong. Huang has argued that continued export curbs risk encouraging China to accelerate development of its own AI chips, which could eventually undercut U.S. dominance in advanced semiconductor technologies. Nvidia shares have risen about 1% year to date, modestly outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is down roughly 1% in the same period. Earlier in May, the Trump administration rescinded the proposed AI diffusion rule, a move seen as a temporary win for Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices. However, regulators signaled they would soon introduce a simpler, replacement rule, keeping pressure on AI chip exports. Nvidia is lobbying for export licenses for the H20, but analysts at Morgan Stanley believe it's unlikely the company will provide any meaningful update during this earnings call.

        "content": "Yahoo Finance Markets ReporterJosh Schaferjoins Asking for a Trend to take a look at how Nvidia (NVDA) has driven S&P 500 (^GSPC) gains since late 2022 in this segment of Chart of the Day. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Nvidia's had a growing impact on the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 gains. So we posed that question earlier today to Dave Mozza, the CEO over at Roundtable Investments to ask him just how much are this round of Nvidia earnings is going to matter for the S&P 500. I want to take a look at what he had to say. We know Nvidia due it, due to its size and scale and the broader markets and major indices and ETFs what have you, uh, is incredibly important. And but it's incredibly important not, not just because it's impact, it's revenue and earnings has, uh, on broader indices, but actually it's sort of tip of the spear for this whole AI revolution. So Mozza mentioning how important Nvidia's been, calling it the tip of the spear for the AI revolution, but in our chart of the day, what we're looking at here is simply how much Nvidia itself, that one stock has meant for S&P 500 gains. We're looking at gains in the S&P 500 since November 30th, 2022. That was when Chat GPT launched and the overall kickoff of that AI boom. You can see here Nvidia has accounted for 17.21% of the S&P 500's total gains over that time period. That means that the 499 companies in the S&P index, the other 499 have accounted for just 82.8. So essentially saying that Nvidia itself was worth almost a fifth of the S&P 500 gains in that two and a half year period. That is why heading into earnings, Nvidia's earnings Wednesday after the bell, people care so much about what this company has to say and how the stock moves. It's one of the largest holdings in the S&P 500. How Nvidia moves after earnings could matter for the S&P 500 overall and the other companies within that index and sort of that momentum AI trade.",

        "content": "By Mike Dolan LONDON (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and global markets today By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Financial Industry and Financial Markets After weeks of trade and debt anxiety, the spotlight has shifted back to theartificial intelligencetheme on Wednesday, as investors wait with rare trepidation for Nvidia's quarterly earnings. I'll dive into all of today's other market news and then explain the significance of the timing of ECB President Christine Lagarde's recent call for the euro to replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency. Today's Market Minute * Demand at an auction of 40-year Japanese government bonds on Wednesday fell to the lowest since July, during a selloff in super-long debt this month. * Oil prices settled 1% lower on Tuesday as investors worried about a supply glut after Iranian and U.S. delegations made progress in their talks and on expectations that OPEC+ will decide to increase output at a meeting this week. * President Vladimir Putin's conditions for ending the war in Ukraine include a demand that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging NATO eastwards and lift a chunk of sanctions on Russia, according to three Russian sources with knowledge of the negotiations. * If the United States is to significantly reduce or eliminate its trade deficit, the dollar will have to weaken a lot. How much is unclear, as history shows large dollar declines are rare and have unpredictable consequences for trade. Check out Reuters columnist Jamie McGeever's latest piece. * U.S. PresidentDonald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill calls for drastic cuts to clean energy tax credits that have been major drivers of the recent boom seen in utility-scale renewable power and battery capacity. In Reuters columnist Gavin Maguire's latest piece, he outlines the potential implications of this in six charts. Spotlight back on Nvidia The inevitable levelling off of Nvidia's explosive growth is already underway, but the chip designer also faces investor worries about AI overspend and questions about how much U.S. chip curbs on China will cost the company going forward. Nvidia's stock price - which is basically unchanged in 2025 to date - climbed anew on Tuesday along with the broad market rally. That was helped by reports that the company will launch a new chipset for China at significantly lower prices than the currently restricted H20 model. Meanwhile, the overall market mood improved considerably, with the S&P 500 jumping 2% on relief over temporarily defused U.S.-European trade tensions, a retreat in long-term government debt yields, and positive U.S. consumer confidence readings for May. However, there were mixed takes on the May household survey, capital goods orders data for last month was soft, and edginess in long bond markets is already coming back. So the main driver of the rally was likely the U.S.-EU trade news after Trump backed down from Friday's 50% tariff threat against the European Union, delaying its implementation until July 9. EU officials have asked leading European companies and CEOs for details of their U.S. investment plans, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as Brussels prepares to advance trade talks with Washington. Tensions on long-dated government debt resurfaced today, meantime, with another tepid sale of Japan's ultra long bonds, reinforcing speculation that Tokyo may be forced to trim sales of debt of such long maturities as fiscal worries grow. The Ministry of Finance sold about 500 billion yen ($3.46 billion) of 40-year bonds with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.21, the lowest since a sale in July last year and well below the historical average of 3. That saw 30-year JGB borrowing rates jump back about 5 basis points from Tuesday close, drawing long-dated yields higher around the world. The yen strengthened slightly on the day. With its own home-grown fiscal concerns, the U.S. saw 30-year yields also back up about 5 bps to just under 5%. Some $70 billion of 5-year Treasury notes come under the hammer later. Meanwhile, investor attention has also turned to a Financial Times report that European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde considered stepping down before her term ends in 2027. The ECB responded by saying Lagarde was determined to complete her eight-year term. Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar held firm even after the country's central bank cut its benchmark rate by 25 bps to 3.25% and flagged a slightly deeper easing cycle than it forecast three months ago. And Shein is working towards a listing in Hong Kong after the online fast-fashion retailer's proposed initial public offering in London failed to secure the green light from Chinese regulators. Now to today's column, where I look into this week's combative speech from ECB boss Lagarde on the status of the euro. Lagarde's euro 'battle cry' emphasizes EU cash need If the euro supplants the dollar as the world's main reserve currency, Europe might lose some currency competitiveness - but the related capital flows it's seeking more than compensate. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde weighed in on the debate about the euro's global reserve status on Tuesday by reiterating the ECB's long-standing aim to boost the currency's wider use and position it as the logical alternative to the dollar. The euro has long been the clear second choice in reserve usage, both in the positive and negative sense. While its share of overall reserve coffers is still far behind the dollar's, the euro is way ahead of any other serious rivals to the greenback bar gold. But what was eye-catching about the very vocal ECB support for wider euro usage was the timing and thrust. Lagarde's statements come amid fresh doubts about the dollar's haven status, the U.S. economy's role in the world at large and America's fraying geopolitical alliances - as well as the Trump administration's perceived desire for a weaker, more competitive exchange rate. And Lagarde's speech clearly framed U.S. difficulty as Europe's opportunity. After noting that the dollar and U.S. financial markets had been effective global anchors for decades, she added that \"when doubts emerge about the stability of the legal and institutional framework, the impact on currency use is undeniable.\" \"These doubts have materialized in the form of highly unusual cross-asset correlations since April 2 this year, with the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries experiencing sell-offs even as equities fell,\" the ECB chief explained, referring to market ructions after Trump's 'reciprocal tariff' gambit last month. \"The EU has a legitimate reason to turn its commitment to predictable policymaking and the rule of law into a comparative advantage,\" Lagarde added, underscoring the need for political and internal capital market reforms in the EU that would enable the bloc to seize this opportunity. Clearest of all was her plea for joint debt issuance to boost the scale of 'safe' euro assets, a move that is still controversial within Europe due to persistent German pushback. \"Economic logic tells us that public goods need to be jointly financed,\" she said, re-upping the ECB's preference for expanding the pool of jointly issued euro assets. And she also pointedly underlined the attraction of Europe's military rearmament to official investors who \"seek geopolitical assurance in another form: they invest in the assets of regions that are reliable security partners and can honour alliances with hard power.\" WHATEVER IT TAKES The frank speaking caught everyone's attention. Rabobank strategist Jane Foley said the speech had a \"battle cry\" element to it. It's still anyone's guess what the outcome will be of the bilateral U.S.-EU trade talks come July's deadline and as a host of disagreements remain. Trump's jarring stop/start EU tariff announcements this past weekend make it difficult to sketch out a possible resolution, and many experts suspect Washington is intent on talking to individual countries to split the group. The tone of the ECB's stance suggests it's bracing for the risk of harsher standoffs ahead. What's more, Lagarde's statement comes as the euro's nominal broad exchange rate has soared to record highs, up almost 20% over the past decade. While that won't please many exporters in the bloc, it does suggest that the ECB - unlike the U.S. administration - is comfortable with its currency's structural strength and thus may be willing to ease policy accordingly. And that will help with the additional debt financing needed of Europe's ambitious new projects - most notably in defense, green energy and tech. On that financing need, central and private sector bankers tend to agree with former ECB chief Mario Draghi about the scale of what is needed, as outlined in his recommendations last summer. For example, BNP Paribas economist Laurent Quignon wrote on Tuesday about the total sums needed, as he made a pitch on what Europe can do this year to boost financing via changes to regulation, securitization and the banking union. Adding Draghi's call for annual energy and tech investments of up to 800 billion euros to an almost 200 billion euros of new defense spending and on top of ongoing commitments, he calculated an additional annual EU financing requirement of 1.5 trillion euros through 2028 and 1.4 trillion from then to 2030. That would be more than double the flows observed in the decade through 2024 - and about the same as the total amount of European money that has flowed into the U.S. equity market since 2012. Whatever the implications for exchange rate competitiveness, Europe now has a big bill to pay. Some 'exorbitant privilege' would help. Chart of the day 'Nvidia day' has become a moment of great excitement for markets in recent years, as the AI darling's stellar earnings and stock gains have typically impressed Wall Street. But investors are approaching today's announcement with caution. That's because Trump's administration, in a fresh effort to limit Beijing's access to cutting-edge technology, last month put export limits on Nvidia's H20 chip, a move the company said would result in $5.5 billion in charges. While the company is expected to report first-quarter revenue surged an annual 66.2% to $43.28 billion, analysts put the quarterly revenue hit ahead from the China chip curbs at anywhere from $3-$4.5 billion.

        "content": "By Mike Dolan LONDON (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and global markets today By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Financial Industry and Financial Markets After weeks of trade and debt anxiety, the spotlight has shifted back to the artificial intelligence theme on Wednesday, as investors wait with rare trepidation for Nvidia's quarterly earnings. I'll dive into all of today's other market news and then explain the significance of the timing of ECB President Christine Lagarde's recent call for the euro to replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency. Today's Market Minute * Demand at an auction of 40-year Japanese government bonds on Wednesday fell to the lowest since July, during a selloff in super-long debt this month. * Oil prices settled 1% lower on Tuesday as investors worried about a supply glut after Iranian and U.S. delegations made progress in their talks and on expectations that OPEC+ will decide to increase output at a meeting this week. * President Vladimir Putin's conditions for ending the war in Ukraine include a demand that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging NATO eastwards and lift a chunk of sanctions on Russia, according to three Russian sources with knowledge of the negotiations. * If the United States is to significantly reduce or eliminate its trade deficit, the dollar will have to weaken a lot. How much is unclear, as history shows large dollar declines are rare and have unpredictable consequences for trade. Check out Reuters columnist Jamie McGeever's latest piece. * U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill calls for drastic cuts to clean energy tax credits that have been major drivers of the recent boom seen in utility-scale renewable power and battery capacity. In Reuters columnist Gavin Maguire's latest piece, he outlines the potential implications of this in six charts. Spotlight back on Nvidia The inevitable levelling off of Nvidia's explosive growth is already underway, but the chip designer also faces investor worries about AI overspend and questions about how much U.S. chip curbs on China will cost the company going forward. Nvidia's stock price - which is basically unchanged in 2025 to date - climbed anew on Tuesday along with the broad market rally. That was helped by reports that the company will launch a new chipset for China at significantly lower prices than the currently restricted H20 model. Meanwhile, the overall market mood improved considerably, with the S&P 500 jumping 2% on relief over temporarily defused U.S.-European trade tensions, a retreat in long-term government debt yields, and positive U.S. consumer confidence readings for May. However, there were mixed takes on the May household survey, capital goods orders data for last month was soft, and edginess in long bond markets is already coming back. So the main driver of the rally was likely the U.S.-EU trade news after Trump backed down from Friday's 50% tariff threat against the European Union, delaying its implementation until July 9. EU officials have asked leading European companies and CEOs for details of their U.S. investment plans, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as Brussels prepares to advance trade talks with Washington. Tensions on long-dated government debt resurfaced today, meantime, with another tepid sale of Japan's ultra long bonds, reinforcing speculation that Tokyo may be forced to trim sales of debt of such long maturities as fiscal worries grow. The Ministry of Finance sold about 500 billion yen ($3.46 billion) of 40-year bonds with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.21, the lowest since a sale in July last year and well below the historical average of 3. That saw 30-year JGB borrowing rates jump back about 5 basis points from Tuesday close, drawing long-dated yields higher around the world. The yen strengthened slightly on the day. With its own home-grown fiscal concerns, the U.S. saw 30-year yields also back up about 5 bps to just under 5%. Some $70 billion of 5-year Treasury notes come under the hammer later. Meanwhile, investor attention has also turned to a Financial Times report that European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde considered stepping down before her term ends in 2027. The ECB responded by saying Lagarde was determined to complete her eight-year term. Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar held firm even after the country's central bank cut its benchmark rate by 25 bps to 3.25% and flagged a slightly deeper easing cycle than it forecast three months ago. And Shein is working towards a listing in Hong Kong after the online fast-fashion retailer's proposed initial public offering in London failed to secure the green light from Chinese regulators. Now to today's column, where I look into this week's combative speech from ECB boss Lagarde on the status of the euro. Lagarde's euro 'battle cry' emphasizes EU cash need If the euro supplants the dollar as the world's main reserve currency, Europe might lose some currency competitiveness - but the related capital flows it's seeking more than compensate. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde weighed in on the debate about the euro's global reserve status on Tuesday by reiterating the ECB's long-standing aim to boost the currency's wider use and position it as the logical alternative to the dollar. The euro has long been the clear second choice in reserve usage, both in the positive and negative sense. While its share of overall reserve coffers is still far behind the dollar's, the euro is way ahead of any other serious rivals to the greenback bar gold. But what was eye-catching about the very vocal ECB support for wider euro usage was the timing and thrust. Lagarde's statements come amid fresh doubts about the dollar's haven status, the U.S. economy's role in the world at large and America's fraying geopolitical alliances - as well as the Trump administration's perceived desire for a weaker, more competitive exchange rate. And Lagarde's speech clearly framed U.S. difficulty as Europe's opportunity. After noting that the dollar and U.S. financial markets had been effective global anchors for decades, she added that \"when doubts emerge about the stability of the legal and institutional framework, the impact on currency use is undeniable.\" \"These doubts have materialized in the form of highly unusual cross-asset correlations since April 2 this year, with the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries experiencing sell-offs even as equities fell,\" the ECB chief explained, referring to market ructions after Trump's 'reciprocal tariff' gambit last month. \"The EU has a legitimate reason to turn its commitment to predictable policymaking and the rule of law into a comparative advantage,\" Lagarde added, underscoring the need for political and internal capital market reforms in the EU that would enable the bloc to seize this opportunity.

        "header": "5 Costly Cryptocurrency Investing Mistakes and How To Avoid Them",
        "content": "With a market cap exceeding $2.6 trillion as of April 2025, cryptocurrencies are no longer niche.In 2024, Bitcoin outpaced traditional assets like the Nasdaq Composite, gold, and the S&P 500drawing in retail and institutional investors alike. But while the rewards of investing in crypto can be great, so are the risks. Crypto markets arevolatile, and scams abound. To invest wisely, it\u2019s crucial to understand crypto\u2019s common pitfalls and how to avoid them. First, let\u2019s address the digital elephant in the room: while there have been many stories over the years of individuals becoming instant millionaires because of their crypto investments, experts, including Anna Stone, co-founder and COO at crypto risk hedging platformCork, stressed that these are the exceptions, rather than the rule. She added that investing in crypto will carry the same principles as any other investment. \u201cAt a high level, it's smart that you're thinking about diversifying your portfolio. It definitely should include digital assets,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, you should be managing your crypto portfolio as part of a broader personal finance and investing strategy. And within that, the same principles really do still apply.\u201d Like any other investment, you should understand the ins and outs of the company or asset you\u2019re backing with your hard-earned money. These issues are magnified when it comes to crypto, because not only do you have to understand the actual asset you\u2019re investing in, but also how you will actually invest in it. \u201cHow are you planning to hold crypto? Go through Fidelity and hold an ETF? Are you going through a centralized exchange where they're acting as your custody partner?\u201d Stone asked. \u201cOr are you engaging? Are you not just holding crypto as an investment, but are you a crypto user? Are you actually using the blockchain to buy and hold different assets?\u201d Once you\u2019ve settled these questions, the next step is to evaluate an individual asset, whether it\u2019s a blue chip crypto such as Bitcoin or Ether or a meme coin, which aren\u2019t necessarily tied to specific projects, such as Dogecoin. It\u2019s at this stage where you\u2019re acting almost like a venture capital investor, said Roland Chow, a financial planner and portfolio manager atOptura Advisors. \u201cIt's a frontier kind of investment. You want to evaluate the team. You want to evaluate what they're doing, what's their vision,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually, they publish a white paper, which started with the precedent of Bitcoin. You want to understand their white paper. What is the problem they're trying to solve?\u201d Experienced investors expect certain markets to be volatile during certain periods of time. For example, during key events such as elections, stock markets may swing up or down. Typically,volatilityis considered any swing greater than 1%. \u201cWe can't predict in a year's time whether the stock market will be up or down, and we can't predict by how much,\u201d Stone said. \u201cCrypto is exactly the same. It's just that the volatility index is actually more pronounced.\u201d Crypto markets can see swings of 10%, 20%, or even 30% within a short period of time. You must be prepared to lose any money that you invest. For that reason, \u201cOne of crypto's terms is HODL, \u2018Hold on for dear life,\u2019\u201d Chow said. Volatility \u201cplays on fear and greed. That compounds the risk of you doing stupid things.\u201d Market volatility is why investors approaching retirement age are recommended to put their money in less risky assets, such as bonds, which typically don\u2019t see large fluctuations in price, compared to more risky assets such as stocks. Seeing an asset lose its value within a short period of time can be frightening and lead less experienced investors to prematurely sell and lock in their losses. If you\u2019re interested in investing in crypto and have found an asset you believe will grow, you must be prepared to stay the course in the face of losses. Any new area that sees a lot of economic activity will also attract bad actors looking to defraud people out of their money. Crypto is no exception. According to the FBI, losses related to cryptocurrency fraud totaled more than $5.6 billion in 2023, a 45% increase from the year before. The most common crypto scams are investment fraud, where typically overseas bad actors use various methods to manipulate victims to send money for what turn out to be fake investments. \u201cAs a result, victims typically lose everything they invested,\u201d the FBI said. There is also the concept of a so-called \u201crug pull.\u201d In these situations, a project\u2014which may have started out legitimately\u2014will attract investment, but its principals will cash out their shares before delivering on their promises. Any investors who didn\u2019t cash out in time are typically left with near-worthless shares. Investing in the markets can be a savvy financial move to grow your wealth, but there\u2019s an equal chance of you losing all your hard-earned money. For that reason, you shouldn\u2019t invest any funds that you need to pay your rent and bills or buy food. \u201cThis is the same principle that would apply to how you manage any other sort of portfolio, which is that you need to think about how much am I investing versus how much cash do I need to have on hand?\u201d Stone said. \u201cWhat would my plan be in terms of exiting these positions and understanding that for crypto, returns will balance out over a longer timeframe, the same way you would take a longer time frame into account when you're thinking about the S&P, the Nasdaq, anything like that.\u201d With any money that you\u2019re investing, you should be prepared to lose it all. Chow recommended that for the average person, 5% to 10% of a portfolio should be crypto. For this reason, it\u2019s also important to diversify your investments. In this way, if one segment of your portfolio drops in value, you\u2019re protected by holding assets in a different segment. For example, that could include tech stocks, energy stocks, and various types of crypto. While day trading platforms have simplified the act of investing, holding crypto is not so simple. There\u2019s the concept of custody, where a common phrase is, \u201cnot your keys, not your crypto.\u201d That means that unless your digital assets are held on a hardware wallet (many of these resemble a USB stick and are protected by a password) not connected to the internet (known as cold storage), you don\u2019t really have full control over them. That said, there are many centralized exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, that will allow you to buy crypto and handle custody for you. This isn\u2019t a cure-all, as we saw with the implosion of FTX and the subsequent arrest of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. In that case, FTX promised to secure its users\u2019 crypto but instead used their money to fund investments by its executives. To keep your crypto secure, you must either invest in a secure wallet or put your trust into a centralized exchange, preferably one regulated by the government. There are a lot of intricacies to crypto. While you don\u2019t have to be an expert at blockchain to back ameme coin, you should have a general understanding of how the technology works. It\u2019ll also be prudent for you to understand the goals of the crypto space, as many proponents of the technology aim to upend fiat-based, central bank-led finance with one that is decentralized, open, and immutable (meaning transactions can\u2019t be changed). \u201cIn a sense, crypto represents this movement of essentially losing trust in the centralized solution,\u201d Chow said. \u201cThe other side is just people who want to make money.\u201d When researching a cryptocurrency, keep this larger context in mind as you evaluate the people behind the project, what technology solutions they\u2019re putting forward, and what their goals are. Read any materials such as the project\u2019s white paper, look into the credentials of their founders, and review their social media posts. As mentioned, crypto sees even more volatility than the stock market, so don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket, or you may end up losing everything. Diversify your portfolio to stem your losses, meaning not only investing in different kinds of assets, from stocks, bonds, to crypto, but also a range of different crypto assets, from blue chips, meme coins, to those backing a range of projects. \u201cYour mindset is really critical in terms of managing risk\u2014being really clear with yourself around: What's my timeframe? Am I expecting to see a profit within a week? Within a month? Within a year?\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe have the standard trading tools, but no one can tell you what's the right tool to use without you having your investment strategy set up.\u201d Knowing this will make it easier to establish rules around your crypto investments, including setting stop-loss orders. These orders essentially establish a floor that will trigger a selloff. Let\u2019s say you bought a meme coin at $8 a piece. If you set a stop loss order at $5, the system will automatically sell your shares at that price. Chow said to be careful when setting these limits, as crypto tends to bounce back quickly. If you sell prematurely, you may miss out on gains. He recommended setting stop-loss orders based on the historical volatility of the asset. \u201cFor instance, if you're trading something that doesn't move around quite a bit, your stop losses can be tight,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you're trading something super volatile, to have a chance of making money and not get stopped out every time, you have to wind those stop losses.\u201d Doing research on each asset you\u2019re interested in investing in will go a long way toward rooting out the legitimate projects from the scams. Common sense can take you far. \u201cIf something seems to be too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAnything that promises you something that's certain, that's risk-free, it's an immediate Spidey sense.\u201d With that said, there are instances of projects that do carry a higher risk but with the potential for higher returns. That doesn\u2019t mean they are scams. \u201cIt just means that these are risks that you need to be aware of,\u201d Stone said. If you\u2019re investing in crypto through a centralized exchange or a traditional brokerage, these entities likely have already done the research and validated each crypto project they offer for trading. Quite simply, if you can\u2019t afford to lose the money you are investing, you should not invest it in the first place. Instead, plan your budget out, then set aside some funds for digital assets. It doesn\u2019t have to be a large amount. You can start with $100, experiment with different assets, and see how it goes. As Stone stressed, it\u2019s also important to have a timeframe in mind. Whether it\u2019s a week or a month, evaluate how your investments are doing and have a plan in place. For example, if your assets appreciated, perhaps you can withdraw some of your earnings and set it aside, either as a backup fund or to invest in other assets. There are multiple methods to invest in and store digital assets. If you do opt to get a hardware wallet, make sure you protect it with a passphrase. Store both the device and passphrase in a safe place, such as a safe deposit box. You don\u2019t want to be in a situation like the one James Howells found himself in, in which he threw away a hard drive said to hold about $800 million in Bitcoin. If you opt to use a centralized exchange, utilize extra security methods such as two-factor authentication. With this system, a temporary code is sent to an account holder to prevent logins by bad actors. Some of the best introductory sources for cryptocurrency research come from the exchanges themselves, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and eToro. These companies\u2019 websites will teach you the basics of crypto and offer deeper dives into various subjects. CoinMarketCap, which pulls data from multiple sources, provides a great overview of assets based on value and trading volume. Finally, X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube are go-to resources for those active in the crypto space. For example, Chow recommends the channel ofRaoul Pal. According to the IRS, \u201cYou may have to report transactions with digital assets such as cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on your tax return. Income from digital assets is taxable.\u201dFind more information on thisIRS website. Cryptocurrencies offer the promise of great potential gains for savvy investors, but digital assets also come with many risks, including volatility and scams. If you\u2019re interested in investing in these assets, make sure you conduct research, set and understand goals, and be prepared to lose money.",

        "content": "They say \u201cthe first $100K is the hardest\u201d\u2014but that doesn't mean yourinvesting and saving journeyends there. So, where does that phrase actually come from, and what does it mean for your money today? Plus, here's why what comes after that $100,000 matters just as much. The idea became famous after the late legendary investorCharlie Mungertold Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in the 1990s that the hardest part of building wealth isn\u2019t becoming a millionaire\u2014it\u2019s reaching that first $100,000. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it the hard way,\u201d Munger said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you have to do\u2014if it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn\u2019t purchased with a coupon.\u201d The point? Wealth builds on itself. Once you hit six figures,compounding, income growth, andsmarter financial habitstend to make the next milestones easier. \u201cSaving is aboutdeveloping the habitsto spend less than you make, but saving $100K is also about learning skills to earn a significant income,\u201d says Noah Damsky, founder of Marina Wealth Advisors. \u201cBuilding good habits and skills to earn is no easy feat.\u201d According to Damsky, it\u2019s those foundational behaviors\u2014saving consistently andincreasing your earning power\u2014that take the most effort to build. But after they\u2019re in place, the path becomes easier. \u201cOnce you develop the habits and skills to save and earn, it can become second nature, like riding a bike, to keep it up.\u201d After reaching $100,000, many people start to second-guess their strategy. Should they pivot tocryptocurrency? Start picking stocks? Avoid that trap\u2014especially if you're not an experienced investor. \u201cMaintaining discipline and avoiding distractions are the hardest parts of building wealth,\" Damsky says. Instead of trying to pick the next market-beating stock, Damsky recommends sticking with low-cost, diversifiedindex funds. \u201cFind aVanguard fundthat tracks a big, boring index, and ride the wave until you need the money.\u201d That means continuing to save, even if the amounts are smaller, and resisting distractions. Once you\u2019ve built that initial cushion, the question becomes: What are you saving for? \u201cYour goal isn\u2019t to build aimless wealth,\u201d Damsky says. \u201cIt\u2019s about achieving your dreams, such asbuying a home, retiring, starting a business, or creating memories on a vacation of a lifetime. Wealth is just a tool. It\u2019s the bridge to your goals.\u201d The habits you used to reach your first $100,000\u2014automated contributions,living below your means, avoiding debt\u2014are the same ones that can carry you forward. But now, it\u2019s about aligning your money with your values. One of the biggest risks after reaching your first major milestone is losing the discipline that got you there. Even Munger himself warned of lifestyle creep. \u201cIn our 20s, we keep our old junky car because we can\u2019t afford anything better,\u201d says Damsky. \u201cIn our 30s, maybe we\u2019ve saved for years and have the money to buy a new car. The hardest part, though, is not buying it even though we can.\u201d Having the means to spend makes it even harder to say no, but staying the course matters. \u201cLosing that discipline is the most common derailment tobuilding wealth over the long term,\" says Damsky. Reaching your first $100,000 in savings and investments is a major accomplishment, but it\u2019s not the finish line. If you want to turn that into $500,000, $1 million, or more, the playbook is largely the same: Keep yoursavings strategy simple, avoid lifestyle inflation, and make sure your savings are in service of the life you actually want. That means maintaining a clear view of your goals for you and your family, and developing a savings and investment plan that helps you to accomplish them.",

Nvidia earnings are a blockbuster, market-moving event for Wall Street. Investors parse the results for any sign that AI demand or investment is waning, making the report a catalyst for AI infrastructure stocks.

        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that use options strategies have exploded in popularity, with two of the most popular types reaching about $120 billion in assets in 2025. The upshot is that you can invest in thesesophisticated income-generating strategieswithout knowing the difference between a call and a put. But do they deliver? Are they worth their higher fees? What are the risks? We're going to focus on two types of ETFs within the broader category of funds whose strategies includederivatives trading: These ETFs handle complex options trading behind the scenes. The result: monthly income from covered call ETFs ordownside protection from buffered ETFsthat shield against initial losses. These funds can be relatively costly, withexpense ratiosup to 10 times those of basic index funds. Covered call(also called \"buywrite\") ETFs have attracted about $75.2 billion in assets, with an average expense ratio of 0.80%, according to our analysis of May 2025 data from the ETF Database.Their appeal is that theyturn volatility into incomeby owning stocks from major indexes like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, then systematically selling call options against their holdings. The strategy works best in sideways or modestly rising markets, when these ETFs can keep both any modest stock gains and the option premiums, according to research. However, May 2025 research from ProShares reveals a significant problem: in the previous decade, funds using these strategies fell almost as much as the broader market during downturns (84% of losses) but missed out on much of the upside (only 65% of gains) during market rallies. For example, when the S&P 500 dropped 32% from February to March 2020 during the pandemic crash, the Cboe S&P 500 BuyWrite Index declined 29%\u2014almost as much. Thus, the downside protection many investors expect is often a \"myth,\" the analysis argued. The strategy gives up much of the potential market upside by selling call options, while income from options premiums does little to protect the downside in selloffs, especially rapid ones. U.S.buffered ETFshave ballooned from $4.6 billion in assets in August 2020 to $43.4 billion, with an average expense ratio of 0.77%. These funds create \"outcome periods\" (usually 12 months) for which they promise specific results: protection against a certain level of losses in exchange forcapped gains. For example, a buffered ETF might shield you from the first 15% of market declines while limiting your gains to 18% even if the market rises, say, 30%. The data shows mixed results. Buffered ETFs returned an average 11% from 2020 to 2025, compared with 14.5% for the S&P 500 Index, according to Morningstar analysts.But they did limit the downside as advertised,reducing portfolio volatility. For example, in 2022, when the S&P 500 lost 18%, the First Trust group of buffer ETFs lost 7.7%; Pacer's buffered ETFs lost just 4.0%. Buffered ETFs' gains during bullish periods seem to be capped at about three-quarters of broader market gains. For example, the TrueShares Structured Outcome January ETF (JANZ) returned 18.1% in 2024, compared with the S&P 500's 25.0%. In addition, AQR Capital analysts in 2025 found that 90% of defined outcome funds delivered lower returns than a simple stocks/cash combination, causing them to argue you're better off \"simply reducing your exposure to equities\" and putting part of your portfolio in cash or bonds. Covered call and buffered ETFs provide easy ways to access sophisticated options strategies without requiring expert knowledge. While appealing toconservative investors, these strategies have significant trade-offs. Covered call ETFs are less effective in fast-moving, directional markets. Buffered ETFs appear to deliver more of what they promise, but keeping more cash on hand might have the same result without the management fees. In fact, both types of ETFs charge fees that are higher than average, which will reduce long-term portfolio growth.",

        "header": "Could ETFs Be Your Key to a Worry-Free Retirement?",
        "content": "Retirement might bring to mind some images of relaxation by the beach, traveling to a bucket-list destination, or spending more time with your grandkids. No matter your vision of the future, the one thing all retirees have in common is a need for a stable income. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)have emerged as a powerful tool for retirees who want to generate reliable income while managing risk and maintaining flexibility. This guide will explain how to leverage ETFs to build a robust\u2014and reliable\u2014retirement income portfolio. ETFs are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges, much like stocks. The difference is that ETFs hold abasket of assets, including stocks, bonds, or commodities. These funds aim to track the performance of a specific index (like the S&P 500), a sector, or a particular investment strategy. This structure provides built-in diversification, spreading your investment across numerous underlying assets. ETFs are highly tradable and built-in diversification. ETFs offer several compelling advantages for retirees seeking income. The first is that they are inherently diversified, holding a variety of assets, reducing the risk associated with investing in individual securities.For instance, a broad marketETF tracking the S&P 500offers exposure to the performance of 500 of the largest U.S. companies across various sectors. Similarly, a broad-based bond ETF can hold hundreds or even thousands of different bonds with varying maturities and credit qualities. This inherent diversification helps to smooth out portfolio returns and reduce volatility, which is particularly important for retirees relying on their investments for income. Another benefit of using ETFs is that they generally have lower expense ratios than actively managed mutual funds, meaning more of your investment returns stay in your pocket. Expense ratios represent the annual fees charged to operate the fund.Even seemingly minor differences in expense ratios can substantially impact your long-term returns, especially over the multi-decade horizon of retirement. Many well-diversified ETFs tracking major market indices have expense ratios below 0.10%, making them a cost-effective way to gain broad market exposure. ETFs also have lots of flexibility. They can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, making themmore liquidthan other investments. \"When selling ETFs, you can choose exactly which shares of the ETF you want to sell,\" saidDavid Rae, a Los Angeles- and Palm Springs-based financial planner and president of DRM Wealth Management. \"In your taxable investment accounts, this can help youminimize the capital gains taxesyou owe by strategically selling shares depending on your overall income and your expected realized gains for the year.\" Dividend ETFshold stocks of companies that regularly pay dividends. The ETF collects and distributes these dividends to shareholders, providing a consistent income stream. According toMark Fonville, CFP, president and CEO of Covenant Wealth Advisors, it's a good idea to start with broadly diversified value-company ETFs in addition to a total stock market ETF. \"Value companies not only tend to pay higher dividends than growth stocks, but history shows they\u2019ve outperformed over long time horizons, though not every year,\" he said. \"They can serve as a steady source of equity income while offering long-term growth potential.\" Bond ETFs invest in various types of bonds, such as government, corporate, or municipal bonds. The regular interest payments from the underlying bonds can provide a more predictable income stream. \"High-quality, short- to intermediate-term bonds can act as a buffer during stock market downturns and help manage what we call \u2018sequence of return risk\u2019\u2014the danger of withdrawing money during a down market early in retirement,\" Fonville said. This is critical because poor early returns can significantly reduce aretirement portfolio'slength. Real estate investment trust (REIT)ETFs invest in companies that own, operate, and finance income-producing real estate. These ETFs are appealing mainly because they can offer attractive dividend yields and provide diversification into the real estate sector. Still, Fonville advises that although REITs can spice up the portfolio, they shouldn't be the main course. Balancing income generation with your risk tolerance and time horizon requires a well-definedasset allocation strategy. \"An ETF\u2019s real value lies in how it strengthens the overall portfolio, not in how large its headline dividend looks,\" Fonville said. He advocates for building a thoughtfully diversified blend of stock and bond ETFs where the long-term expected total return comfortably exceeds your anticipated withdrawal rate. Rae added that your ETF portfolio can work well without overcomplicating it. \"You can cover the entire stock market with just a few ETFs,\" he said. \"A bit of diversification around the globe is still wise, and owning a few different ETFs can give you more flexibility to generate income tax efficiently when you need to sell some shares.\" Diversifying across asset classes and sectors within your ETF portfolio is a risk management tool. Another tip from Fonville is to avoid chasing those with the fattest yield. \"Many high-payout ETFs achieve that income by loading up on concentrated sectors, lower-quality bonds, or extra leverage,\" he said. \"Those hidden risks can turn a \u2018safe\u2019 6 % dividend into an uncomfortable loss of principal just when a retiree needs steady cash flow.\" You can also manage your risk by regularlyreviewing and rebalancing your portfolioas your circumstances or market conditions change over time. Understanding the tax implications of income generated from ETFs is vital for maximizing your after-tax retirement income. Income from ETFs can come in the form of dividends (taxed as ordinary income or qualifieddividends, depending on the holding period and the underlying stocks), interest (taxed as ordinary income), and capital gains (taxed at different rates depending on the holding period). Strategically holding different types of ETFs in various account types (e.g., tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, as well as taxable brokerage accounts) can significantly impact your tax liability. For instance, holding bond ETFs that generate ordinary income in tax-deferred accounts can be advantageous. Rae notes that the ability to selectively sell specific ETF shares in taxable accounts offers a valuable tool for managing capital gains taxes. Consulting with a qualified tax advisor is highly recommended to develop a tax-efficient ETF investment strategy tailored to your individual circumstances. Retirees should be vigilant in avoiding common pitfalls that can undermine their ETF-based income strategy. A frequent and costly mistake that Rae sees is not giving your investments enough time. Impatience for high immediate income can lead to retirees making impulsive decisions, such as chasing unsustainable yields or selling investments prematurely during market downturns, thereby locking in losses. Other common mistakes include: A common approach involves a diversified mix of broad market equity ETFs,dividend-focused ETFs, a range of bond ETFs (with varying maturities and credit quality), and potentially REIT ETFs, allocated according to your specific circumstances. ETFs offer a compelling combination of diversification, low costs, transparency, and liquidity that may be less readily available with other retirement income strategies, such as individual stock and bond picking, actively managed mutual funds, or annuities. Long-term benefits include potential for steady income, diversification, lower costs, and flexible investment management. ETFs provide a versatile and efficient way for retirees to generate a reliable income stream. By understanding the different types of income-generating ETFs, implementing sound asset allocation and risk management strategies, and being mindful of tax considerations and common pitfalls (including not giving your investments enough time, as Rae cautioned), retirees can build a robust portfolio to support their financial well-being throughout their retirement years. The key is to focus on building a well-balanced portfolio where each ETF plays a strategic role in achieving your income goals. \"Focus on the role each ETF plays inside a balanced cast, and let the ensemble, not a single soloist, carry the show,\" Fonville said.",

        "header": "The Retirement Strategy Many People Overlook\u2014But Could Supercharge Your Savings",
        "content": "Living comfortably during your golden years heavily depends on your ability to set up sources of retirement income that will augmentmodest Social Security payouts. Establishing retirement funds such as a 401(k) or Roth IRA is a common way people fund their retirements, but there\u2019s another mechanism to boost retirement income while offering the benefit of a payout to your loved ones in the case of your death: life insurance. Indeed, certain life insurance plans can provide a supplemental source of retirement funds that bypass taxes (as long as you follow the rules) while making your portfolio less dependent on the markets, providing financial security in the face of unexpected situations. You can borrow against your balance, typically at lower rates than other types of loans. If you need a life insurance policy that will provide supplemental retirement income, term life insurance isnotwhat you\u2019re looking for. Rather, term life insurance strictly provides thebasic protection of death benefitsin the case of your passing. Term life is popular with buyers who are looking to save money.\u00a0 These plans are lower-cost and provide coverage for a set period, typically terms of 10, 20, or 30 years. Note: The affordability comes in through the fact that premiums remain the same throughout the length of the policy. If you die, your designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) receive the death benefit. \u201cThink of term insurance like paying your car insurance,\u201d saidSteven Conners, founder and president of Conners Wealth Management in Scottsdale, Ariz. \u201cAs you pay, you're covered. Should you stop paying your premium, you do not have insurance then.\u201d He added, \u201cYou don't want to think about [term life] for retirement. It's just the lowest cost if that's what you can afford and you need the coverage.\u201d Conners went on to say that term life may be more for peace of mind rather than financial security. According to his own studies, people typically outlive their term life insurance policies, with only 2% to 3% of death benefits being paid out. As its name suggests,whole life insurance policieswill stick it out with you to the end. Not only do they provide a death benefit in the case of your passing, but they also accrue value the more you pay into them. Whole life policesaccumulate cash value\u2013typically, tax-deferred\u2013no matter which way the market is trending. Speaking of those payments, how much you\u2019ll pay depends on your coverage amount\u2014basically, how much will be paid out when you die\u2014your age and your health. Health factors include any recurring conditions and whether you smoke. Once the insurance company calculates your premiums, your payments, whether monthly or annually, will remain the same. Whole life insurance policies can enhance retirement income because many of them pay out dividends\u2014as long as they are participating whole life plans. When the company is doing well financially, a company will issue its policyholders a dividend, which Conners said could provide an internal rate of return of around 5%, depending on the policy. The cash value of the policy will not provide significant income until after the cash value has built up. This usually takes several years of premium payments, according to Northwestern Mutual.Policyholders can withdraw or take a loan against their policy, which reduces its cash value as well as the death benefit. For these reasons, Conners said that whole life insurance policies are a popular investment vehicle on behalf of children, who pay low premiums and are easily approved (as long as they don\u2019t have any major health conditions). \u201cIt doesn't move, they're constant, and the cash value keeps growing,\u201d Conners said of these policies. Similar to whole life insurance, universal life insurance also provides death benefit coverage and accrues value over the course of your life. But there are notable differences. These policies offer flexibility. Policyholders can raise or lower premiums, although Guardian notes that doing so can impact the cash value of the policy and ultimately, the death benefit. While the value of a whole life insurance policy increases with contributions and dividends, universal life insurance policies grow through interest and decreased insurance costs.  \u201cIt's not that the return is so great that people are stepping over to get life insurance policies because they're that much better than other investments,\u201d Conners said. \u201cIt's because they may be the same as other investments. However, the money can grow tax-free.\u201d Along with moretraditional retirement income sourcessuch as a 401(k), Roth IRA, pension, and/or Social Security, holders of certain life insurance policies can use the balances of their accounts as a supplemental source of retirement income. In the case of a whole life insurance policy, the growth of your balance comes in the form of dividend payments. With a universal life policy, the growth comes from interest or returns from the indexes the policy is invested in. Unlike those other sources of retirement income, life insurance policies are not directly impacted by the stock market. As long as you\u2019re keeping up with your contributions, you can expect a nice chunk of change to be available to you to spend how you wish during your golden years. Depending on the policy, any withdrawals or loans will reduce the amount of funds available to your beneficiary or beneficiaries after you die. There are a handful of investments whose gains are not subject to taxes. These include 529 plans for children, Roth IRAs, certain bonds, and arguably the employer-matched funds of a 401(k) account. According toCraig Ferrantino, founder and principal of Craig James Financial Services in Melville, NY, investment-grade life insurance also falls into this category. \u201cThere's very few in that tax-free category, so we like it in our toolbox,\u201d he said. Again, withdrawing from a life insurance policy will be tax-free as long as the policy is in effect and you stay within the limits allowed by the government (known as themodified endowment contract). Financial advisors, including Ferrantino, recommend life insurance policies such as whole life insurance because, compared to other investments, insurance companies are relatively stable. First off, most are private companies, meaning they\u2019re not subject to the whims of the market or profit-hungry shareholders. They\u2019re also rated by outside agencies such as Fitch, Moody\u2019s, or AM Best, who evaluate whether they have cash on hand to cover all their expenses. Financial advisors recommend sticking with the A-rated companies. \u201cWe don't see a lot of insurance companies going out of business, either to get sold or something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's very unlikely that they're going to fold. So you are going to keep continuing to get your benefits.\u201d These policies also provide financial security because of their death benefits, Conners said. Even if you have liabilities before your passing, you can feel secure knowing that your family members won\u2019t be burdened by them because of the death benefit payout. All savvy investors know not to put all their eggs in one basket. Holding too many assets in one category\u2014such as energy, tech, or retail\u2014can leave your portfolio in the red since these assets in the same category tend to move in the same direction together. When you hold a whole life insurance policy that pays out dividends, it\u2019s mostly segregated from market forces. Universal life policies are more tied to the markets, but many plans protect policyholders from losses. \u201cIt's a non-correlated asset, so if the stock market crashes, so what?\u201d Conners said. \u201cThe worst return you could ever get in an index universal life policy is no credit that year.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that policy fees still apply even in zero-return years. With any retirement account, there\u2019s always the danger of you outliving your benefits. As lifespans have increased, there\u2019s a danger of using up all your retirement funds. Having a life insurance policy as anadditional source of retirement incomecould alleviate those concerns. \u201cIt'll give you a guaranteed payment or add to your pension every year for as long as you live. That's longevity protection,\u201d Ferrantino said. \u201cIf you don't live so long, then it's nice to know you won't run out of money.\u201d Conners added that many of the retired clients he works with who find themselves in the ideal situation of having little debt feel safe knowing they have this additional account to tap into that doesn\u2019t carry the same risks of taxation that other retirement accounts can carry. If you find yourself in a situation in which your life insurance policy won\u2019t be as beneficial to you as you had initially expected, the IRS allows you tomove the cash value of the policyto something similar, without tax consequences. According to the IRS, \u201c1035 provides non-recognition treatment for taxpayers who have \u2018merely exchanged an [annuity contract] for another better suited to their needs and who have not actually realized gain. \u2026The contracts exchanged must relate to the same insured, and the obligee or obligees under the contract received in the exchange must be the same as those under the original contract.\u201d Many of the major retirement account providers have calculators that can be used to approximate how much income you\u2019ll have during retirement. For a more extensive calculation, engage the services of a financial advisor, who will create a more complete picture of your retirement based on your assets and liabilities. \u201cThe best source of income is one that continues for life,\u201d Conners said. \u201cThis may be a pension from your former employer. It can also be an individual retirement plan (IRA) that you have been paying for many years. The main source should be preferably a guaranteed amount that you can realistically count on through thick and thin.\u201d There likely isn\u2019t a \u201cbest investment.\u201d Ideally, your retirement income will come from a variety of sources, including retirement accounts and a life insurance policy. Those looking to diversify their retirement income should consider a life insurance policy. Not only do these policies provide peace of mind due to the death benefit they bestow to your beneficiary, but they\u2019re also a way to earn extra income, either through dividends with a whole life policy or interest payments through a universal life policy.",

        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA)first quarter results beaton revenue, but a $4.5B charge tied to its H20 chip complicates the picture. Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Asking for a Trend to break down the numbers and what they mean for Nvidia's outlook in China and beyond. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Well, in video reporting better than expected first quarter revenue. Earnings, depending on which metric you look at, missed estimates when including that 4 and a half billion dollar charge and related tax impact related to the H20 chip. So, if you look at and include the impact of that charge, you get 81 cents a share. If you exclude the charge from H20, you get 96 cents a share. The consensus estimate was 93. The stock is performing as though there was a beat somewhere in there. So let's get a closer look now at the key catalyst for Nvidia and the big tech landscape. Let's bring in Sunova's Trust senior portfolio manager, Daniel Morgan. Daniel Morgan, it is lovely to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. Um so what do you think of these numbers? Uh uh you know, as we are seeing this initial reaction and as we await the call? Really. You know, Julie and Josh, I think you need to be a CPA to interpret these numbers and come up with a picture of exactly what's going on. I mean, I think the things that really stood out is what you guys talked about, which is, I think what the street is doing, they're kind of netting out the H20 charge off, right? It was what a 4.5 billion inventory charge off. They said on the call or their in their notes that they missed out on 2.5 billion in revenue on the first quarter, and on the second quarter, they missed out on about 8 billion related to the H20. That would be revenue they could have accrued, you know, they had it ready to ship, but they couldn't do it. So I think maybe that's why the street is reacting the way they are because obviously the guide going in the second quarter Josh was 45 billion. Street was looking for 46 and a half billion, so it's a little bit off. But then if we add in that 8 billion, right? Wow, it's you know, it's over 50 billion, right? So, uh again, I think you need to be a CPA to kind of get through these numbers. And that gross margin number two, right? Without the charge you're at 71%. With it you're at 61%. So pick your pick your number, right? Well, Dan, I'm not a CPA, but fortunately, I have you to help me try and make sense of all this. I'm wondering Dan, if I'm an in Nvidia investor, I'm listening to this right now. How should I be thinking Dan about what that opportunity for this company is in China, not just now, but long term? How would you frame it? Well, you're right, Josh, and the opportunity is still there. I mean, there's a lot of thought out there that they're going to do a streamline Blackwell chip and they're going to sell that into China once they can get it approved, uh you know, by the the Trump administration. Very similar what they did when they did the scaled downs on the H20 and the L40. So I don't think China's off the map, right? I mean, they at one point we're getting, you know, 15, 20% of their revenues coming from China. So, but you know, the other thing, Josh and Julie, is kind of interesting and you know, just to kind of take a step back from this minutia of this report, you know, think about some of the things that they may have going on, let's say in Saudi Arabia or Middle East. We know that's now been opened up more for trade. There was a big order that came in for 18,000 GPUs that's going to be executed here. So even if China never gets back to the way it was before, I still think that there's long-term opportunities in other parts of the world, like Saudi Arabia, like the Middle East, because now we're opening up relations with them, and we're going to become more involved with them in terms of trade.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.85 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.61 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -4.71%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.89, delivering a surprise of 5.95%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Nvidia , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $44.06 billion for the quarter ended April 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.67%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $26.04 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Nvidia shares have added about 0.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 0.7%. While Nvidia has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Nvidia: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.97 on $45.11 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.19 on $193.52 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the top 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Another stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Zscaler (ZS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2025. The results are expected to be released on May 29. This cloud-based information security provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. Zscaler's revenues are expected to be $666.11 million, up 20.4% from the year-ago quarter.

        "content": "Shares of semiconductor software companies sank, weighed down by a report that they had been caught up in the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to hamstring China\u2019s ability to develop sophisticated artificial intelligence. The Financial Times on Wednesday reported the White House had instructed companies that sell software used to design semiconductors to stop providing their services to Chinese clients. Shares of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Synopsys (SNPS) tumbled 10.7% and 9.6%, respectively, on Wednesday. Those companies did not respond to Investopedia's requests for comment in time for publication. The report arrived ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) report of its latestquarterly financial results, with the chip giant saying it took a substantial financial hit\u2014though smaller than it initially thought\u2014after the White House in early April tightened restrictions on the export of advanced chips to China. ReadInvestopedia'sfull coverage ofNvidia's results here. The Trump administration has escalatedthe Biden administration\u2019s effortsto curb China\u2019s access to cutting-edge semiconductors. Nvidia in particular lost out on some revenue associated with its H20 chips, which it developed specifically to comply with Biden-era restrictions. Competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) estimated it would take an $800 million hit for similar easons. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangreportedly blastedU.S. export controls as \"a failure\" during an industry conference earlier this month. Huang argued the restrictions had encouraged local technology firms to develop sophisticated chips on their own, eroding U.S. firms' market share without preventing China's AI prospects. Trump earlier this monthrescindedBiden's \"AI diffusion rule,\" which would have expanded export restrictions and tightened existing controls. The administration says it will eventually issue its own rule to prevent US-made chips from reaching China via other countries.",

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. If you have a brokerage firm account, your balance will sometimes includeidle cash. Perhaps it was generated from the sale of a stock orETFand you haven't yet decided whether to reinvest the funds. Or perhaps you're intentionally keeping a portion of your portfolio in cash, shielding it from market volatility. Whatever your reason, you'll want to earn a reasonable return on those uninvested funds. And while every brokerage firm offers amoney market fundinto which you can sweep your idle cash, the yields on these options vary across firms. Right now, thethree largest brokerage firms\u2014Charles Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity\u2014paymoney market yieldsin the upper 3% to lower 4% range. (Because money market fund rates change\u00a0relative to the previous day's bond market, these quoted returns are the average 7-day yields.) Vanguardleads the pack, paying 4.20% on its Federal Money Market Fund (VMFXX). Among the three,Fidelitypays the least. Its Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX) currently yields 3.92%. Sandwiched between the two isCharles Schwab, where most customers can earn 4.12% with its Prime Advantage Money Fund - Investor Shares (SWVXX). However, wealthy investors with at least $1 million in uninvested funds are invited to earn a higher rate with Schwab's Ultra Shares (SNAXX). There, the current yield is 4.27%\u2014beating Vanguard's 4.20% offer. Though rates in the upper-3% and lower-4% range are reasonably competitive, you can significantly boost your earnings by moving uninvested cash to a top-paying savings account instead. More than a dozen ofthe best high-yield savings accountspay 4.40% or more\u2014up to a top rate of 5.00% APY. Though keeping your cash at the same institution as your investment accounts may be convenient, the advantage is slight. That's because electronic transfers to or from a bank account, while not instantaneous, can usually be executed by your brokerage firm in a single day. Also, if you don't plan to invest the cash soon, the case is even stronger for letting it earn a much higher rate in a high-yield savings account until you're ready to re-invest. Of course, for some investors, the ultimate strategy will be a hybrid one: Keep a cushion of uninvested cash where you have your investment accounts so you can make a quick trade if desired, while moving a portion of the funds into a nation-leading savings account to bump up your earnings. Another good option for maximizing your return on cash is socking a portion of your savings in one oftoday's top-paying CDs. Unlike savings and money market yields that can change at any time\u2014and will begin fallingonce the Fed begins lowering interest rates\u2014a CD's rate is locked and guaranteed for the full term of the certificate. Right now, that means you can lock in 4.28% to 4.65% on terms ranging from 3 months to 5 years. We update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available: Note that the \"top rates\" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

The chip stock continues to get a lift in extended hours trading afterbeating first quarter revenue estimates \u2014 $44.1 billionvs. estimates of $43.3 billion \u2014 while bans on chip shipments to China dragged down the company's earnings per share to $0.81 (below estimates of $0.93 per share). Rhodium Group Director Reva Goujon comes on Yahoo Finance's Nvidia earnings special to speak further on the United States' export controls on AI semiconductors and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's relationship with President Trump. Also catch Benchmark Company's Cody Acree full interview with Yahoo Finance onNvidia's business in China and whether it can overcome new trade barriers. When video like most chip makers has struggled with geopolitical concerns, tariff policies and global marketplace risk, our next guest is a geopolitical strategist who works with businesses and governments to help mitigate risk. Reva Gujan is the director at Rhodium Group. It's a research and advisory firm focusing on global challenges and data analysis. Reva, it is great to see with always. So let me get your take Reva on on this Nvidia report and specifically Reva, what do you make of of what they're telling us about business in China? Uh, well, they are certainly lamenting declining business in China due to the H20 ban. As we know, Jensen referred to that as a deeply painful hit, um, affecting some 15 billion in potential sales of the China market. So obviously they're not thrilled about that. Um, but it was a long time coming, right? And Nvidia is also trying to use a lot of momentum in the moment from Trump's overhaul of the Biden era AI diffusion rule, which opens up third markets, uh, for Nvidia to to deploy its GPUs while still closing off China. Um, but they're trying to use that momentum to also push for a broader easing of chip controls on China directly. There are just a lot of reasons why I don't think that latter part is going to happen. Well, and Reva, Nvidia continues to try to sort of get around these export controls. There's been reporting that it's developing another chip to ship into China, although it did say in a filing today that it might be unable to uh, provide and create that product that would be a competitive one in China. Do you think it does succeed in sort of getting around the the rules as it has been? It's tough. I mean, there is a cat and mouse game between BIS regulators at Commerce on the one hand and Nvidia on the other. Of course, Nvidia is going to be the prime target under scrutiny for the design of any potential controls. And so, you know, with this, the the kind of variant of the Blackwell chip for the China market, um, from what we can tell, right, they have designed it to strip down the memory bandwidth by more than half compared to the original H20. Um, they designed this without any advanced coOS advanced packaging technology. Um, so it's a stripped down, uh, chip and it is going to come at a discount, but you, this is where you also have Huawei, um, with a competitive edge, um, offering discounted chips, um, that are also are going to be at higher performance. Reva, you know, President Trump right now does seem to be a fan of Jensen Wong. You saw them in the Middle East together. That's a nice place for Jensen to be. I'm wondering how you think Jensen Wong maybe could try and and capitalize on that relationship, capitalize on that friendship, Reva. Well, it's, uh, it's a mixed bag, right? There are a number of tech influencers surrounding the president, um, and he's hearing from from all of them, but there are also lines being drawn. And I think the message here, um, for a company like Nvidia and others is focus on the X China market for your growth, right? Don't bank on on that market for your future that, you know, AI infrastructure build outs have to happen all around the world. Um, Jensen has taken this message globally of this idea of AI sovereignty and he wants Nvidia to be at the epicenter of those build outs. Uh, from a policy perspective, the White House agrees and says, you know, this is the time to lock in those AI infrastructure dependencies so that it's US-made and design chips and US hyperscalers that are are leading these build outs globally, but not in China, right? And so, so that's the catch here. So whenever you're looking at any one of these tech influencers, there's always going to be, um, some give and take on on how far that influence actually goes.

        "content": "By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) -REX Financial launched a single-stock exchange-traded fund tied to Nvidia, the powerhouse chipmaker that has dominated stock market returns over the last two years, on Wednesday morning, hours ahead of the release of Nvidia's earnings. The new fund, the REX NVDA Growth & Income ETF is a form of covered call ETF that uses option strategies to generate income while at the same time giving investors exposure to a portion of the upside in Nvidia's stock price, REX said. \"We think it will allow people to have their cake and eat it, too,\" said Scott Acheychek, REX's chief operating officer. \"They can stick with the stock that they follow and know and like, but with a risk profile that they're comfortable with and some weekly income\" from the sale of options on Nvidia, he said. These single-stock option-based ETFs made their debut in late 2023, and now have about $10 billion in total assets. Overall interest in single-stock ETFs, a broader category that includes 1.5x or 2x leveraged products, continues to grow, said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. \"They're all aimed at self-directed individual investors,\" Armour said. While an ETF with this kind of structure likely would outperform the underlying stock if that stock is flat to lower, Armour said it makes more sense for investors either to buy individual stocks outright or to turn to options-based ETF strategies that are tied to broader portfolios. \"A product like this is not trying to maximize either growth or income.\" Acheychek said this new approach to covered call single-stock ETFs is aimed at investors who increasingly are looking for alternative income-generating products.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.81 per share. Excluding an H20 charge and related tax impacts, adjusted earnings were $0.96 per share. Revenue of $44.1 billion was better than the expected $43.29 billion. Data center revenue was $39.1 billion versus the $39.22 billion estimate. In the video above, Yahoo Finance AnchorsJulie HymanandJosh Liptonare joined by Futurum CEO Daniel Newman and TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell to discuss the results and comments from the conference call. Check out Yahoo Finance's Nvidia earnings coveragehere. Let's recap Nvidia's numbers now. The company reported solid earnings after the bell, revenue rising 69% from a year earlier to $44.1 billion, that's ahead of analyst estimates on average. Nvidia did take a smaller than forecast 4 and a half billion dollar write-down related to increased restrictions of sales of its chips into China, including that charge, earnings per share coming in at 81 cents. That also beat comparable estimates. Sales in the current quarter will amount to 45 billion dollars, plus or minus 2%, that's roughly in line with most analyst estimates, and that does include the loss of $8 billion in revenue from sales of those H20 chips, which it had been selling into China. And Jensen Wong talking about that Chinese market for AI being around $50 billion and highlighting the disadvantage that he believes not only the company is now put at because of these export controls, but that the industry more broadly is facing as a result of that as well. So those were the numbers, Josh. I'm seeing a positive reaction obviously in the after hours to those. Yeah, I'm just seeing this post by Jean Monster here who's a tech analyst and everybody on the on the panel knows. Monster is is making the case that he thinks the stock should be trading higher than it is here than 4%. The reason he says that if you back out the impact of the curbs, he says year-over-year revenue growth in April would have been 79% and the guide for July would have been 76%. Latest evidence, he says the company's growth will be higher for longer. All right, let's bring our panel back here. We've got Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis. We've got Dan Newman here as well. So guys, really hearing a couple things on that call. Really the emphasis that we've been hearing now kind of since the beginning of this latest wave of Nvidia. We can do inference. We can do inference. We can do inference. Can you guys do inference? Did you mention you could do inference? So they're really emphasizing that their chips are well suited for this current stage of where we are in AI. And then of course the message from Jensen Wong himself that export controls are a bad deal for everyone concerned he seems to think. Well, and the other theme he brought up, of course, was a theme we've heard a lot before which is sovereign AI, right? You know, and doing sovereign AI wherever we can. So look, I mean, And sovereign AI just means countries doing AI for themselves. Yes. Literally, that's all it means. It's it's a very fancy sounding way. Like governments doing AI. Exactly. Um, but look, I mean the, I think all the positive points of of opportunity for growth are still there. I I found it very interesting actually that all the customer examples they talked about actually were enterprises. Remember which is something I I'm like, even though the absolute numbers, I think, are still small for enterprise. Those were the examples they gave. They also actually gave a number of examples around robotics, which we also know is like basically just about zero revenue yet. So I think clearly the company is trying to tell the story beyond obviously that yes, we can do inference and that we need to be in China. You know, hello President Trump, you're listening. We need to be in China. You're cutting us off from $50 billion. Please don't do that. Um, then it's like, and here are the other growth opportunities. So I think they're trying to set the stage and tell the story around where those growth opportunities are by focusing on some examples, um, you know, from those different sectors. Dan, I'm interested to get your take. We were chewing over this earlier about the opportunity in the Middle East. And and one I wanted to get your sense of, is it possible one reason investors got so excited when they saw Jensen Wong over there and he's making these deals in Saudi Arabia and the UAE because did it potentially address one issue that the Nvidia skeptics on this show have brought forward? And you'll hear this. They'll say, well, maybe 2025 is really the high watermark in AI spend. This is peak AI spend. And maybe folks looked at the Middle East and said, well, or maybe there's some really deep pocketed folks who can keep this party going. Yeah, the AI bubble folks, the ones that said the party's already over are entirely wrong. And they're going to continue to be wrong. Why do you say that, Dan? Because we're just in the early stages. When you actually listen to what he, you know, Bob was just talking about the enterprise build out the consumption, we're actually in the very earliest stages. The consumption, the inference opportunity, the reason Jensen's so focused on it is because the trillions of tokens that will be concurrently used to do a genetic or to do humanoids, we haven't even started that. And that's what's going to really create this need for a power and B, more infrastructure. I want to take a quick step back though and talk about China because the Middle East actually proved an important point. And it's that the US is actually on board for AI diffusion around the world and wants US and Western AI to win everywhere, including in complicated regions like the Middle East. China is a different animal. And I think it's interesting because Jensen is saying all the right things for Nvidia. But for the US, I don't know that he's saying the right things. And I don't believe, and I just on the record, I do not believe that China's resolve and China's commitment to building a competitive product has anything to do with whether or not we sell Nvidia into that market. Remember, Chinese is run by the Communist Party. Chinese puts its own national interests first. So even if Nvidia and its stack and its superior software, CUDA, is everywhere in China, at any point Xi Jinping can say no more Nvidia. You are going to switch to CAN, their version of CUDA. And that could happen. Right now they're doing it with the Ascend chips. The Ascend chips are a they are much less capable than even the older hopper chips. And that's the reason they still want them. But they are putting them together. They are building two coal-fired plants per week. They are building an energy capacity to be able to deliver on AI and they understand the next multiple decades of economic leadership are going to sit on winning AI. They're not standing back. They're not sitting idly. But if I'm an Nvidia investor, if I'm a shareholder, or if I'm Jensen, he's saying the exact right things. But if I'm President Trump, I'm still listening to counsel from different sides because in China's resolve is is substantial. It's absolute, and they have no interest in standing by idly and letting the US just have AI. Yeah, no, and I and I completely agree. I mean, the, you know, the challenge is going to be that China is getting a lot better, right? And those Huawei chips that you were talking about, the Ascend chips, I mean, they are slowly but surely getting better. But you know, just today there was an announcement I saw that Cadence and Synopsis, the big EDA companies, that companies who create the software for designing advanced chips, just got whacked basically and and told, sorry, you can't sell that into China either. So there's a lot of efforts there. I mean, I do find it interesting that in essence, we've heard a couple people throughout the program basically say, hey, we're starting to model Nvidia without China, basically, right? And they're saying, hey, let's what does the world look like if we do that? And then obviously anything they get into China is just gravy, you know, above and beyond that. And so I think we'll probably see some people probably follow that route for a while, and then I think we'll see other people, you know, take different approaches. But it's, you know, it's a big question, um, that, you know, it's going to it's going to take a while to figure out and and you can make strong arguments on on both sides of this. Remember remember the stakes, Josh, at play are this trade deal. This trade deal is still out there. The Synopsis, Cadence, Siemens, EDA block, anything to slow down. Now, again, protectionism, I would actually go on and say, I do not believe the long-term strategy is to focus on protectionism. But right now, you would have to say, well, if we're not focused on that, then why don't we just give them ASML too? Why don't we give them EUV and advanced lithography and everything else? There's a reason this was done by the Democrats. There's a reason this is being continued by the Republicans. In the end, the US has to win. I think it's a balance of protectionism, and then therefore diffuse our AI everywhere else in the meantime.",

Huang's comments came during a conference call after chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) reported itslatest financial results\u2014which included a multibillion dollar hit to revenue and a ding to earnings associated with export curbs on the company's H20 chips to China. (ReadInvestopedia'slive coverage ofNvidia's results here.) They follow amid-May trade truceof sorts between Trump and China, which have put on hold steep tariffs on each other's imports while the countries seek a trade deal. Instead of limiting Chinese AI capabilities, Huang said, the curbs have \"spurred China's innovation and scale.\" \u201cThe question is not whether China will have AI\u2014it already does,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe question is whether one of the world's largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position.\" Policy assumptions that China can't make its own AI chips are \"clearly wrong,\" said Huang. The CEO also called it \"terrific\" that Trump\u00a0rescinded the Biden administration's AI diffusion rule, which would've put additional restrictions on the export of AI chips, particularly to countries that aren't U.S. allies. The Trump administration has said it\u2019s looking to replace the rules, and analystshave warnedthat new ones could be stricter than Biden's. \"President Trump wants America to win, and he also realizes that that we're not the only country in the race,\" Huang said Wednesday.

He identifies three major takeaways from the earnings call: an increase in inference demand, what Nvidia's future projects might look like, and CEO Jensen Huang's pushback against export controls. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Yahoo! Finance's Dan Howley for his reaction to the call. Dan, give us your highlights. Yeah, I want to talk about some things that CFO Colette Kress had pointed out. Uh, we have some audio from her going over what she sees as the inferencing explosion. We are witnessing a sharp jump in inference demand. OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are seeing a step function leap in token generation. Microsoft processed over 100 trillion tokens in Q1. So it was another kind of bit that she pointed out when it comes to the future projects that Nvidia is working on. We have a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure in the not too distant future. You know, there's there's more to that obviously. But then we had CEO Jensen Huang going over kind of the the idea that they won't be able to use Hopper moving forward and then what that means for the the Chinese market and and the potential for the US to miss out on it. China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success. With half of the world's AI researchers based there, the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. So this is obviously, you know, a the the basically the sharpest pushback we've seen from Jensen Wong with regards to these export controls. Now he's he's criticized these before, especially at GTC, things like that. He said that essentially export controls are a failure and that there should be other ways to work around this. But him saying directly, look, we're basically giving China these these this ability to build out its own AI infrastructure rather than having them rely on US AI infrastructure is is a negative for not just Nvidia, but the US as a whole.",

Then, after starting to nudge higher within the last hour of trading, all major indexes took a downturn into the close.

        "header": "Can Nvidia Stock Hit New Heights? CEO Jensen Huang Just Provided Clear and Compelling Evidence That the Answer Is \"Yes.\"",
        "content": "To say that investors were on the edge of their seats ahead ofNvidia's(NVDA-0.27%)highly anticipated financial report may well be an understatement. As the poster child for theartificial intelligence (AI)revolution, the company has become the benchmark for the tech industry at large and the yardstick by which progress in AI is being measured. While the chipmaker delivered better-than-anticipated results on both the top and bottom lines, there were a few blemishes in what would have been an otherwise spotless report. Let's take a look at what the results reveal, and if they give us any insight into the future of AI. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on stage at GTC 2025. Image source: Nvidia. Investors had high hopes ahead of Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), and the AI chipmaker delivered. The company generated record revenue of $44.1 billion, up 69% year over year and 12% quarter over quarter. This drove adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81, which climbed 33%. For context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $43.25 billion and EPS of $0.75, so Nvidia sailed past expectations with some wiggle room. Fueling the bullish results was a record-setting performance from the data center segment, which continues to drive growth. The segment -- which includes processors used for data centers, AI, and cloud computing -- generated revenue that surged 73% year over year to $39.1 billion, driven by continuing demand for AI. One item of note was the Trump administration's tightening export restrictions. Nvidia's H20 processor was originally designed to meet the already rigid requirements for AI chips destined for China. However, demand evaporated thanks to the new, more stringent licensing requirements, causing Nvidia to take a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 -- though that was lower than the $5.5 billion estimate the company provided last month. The impact of the move trickled its way down the financial statements. For example, if not for the write-off, Nvidia's adjusted EPS would have clocked in at $0.96, resulting in a hit of about $0.15 per share. However, as revenue jumped 69%, operating expenses climbed just 44%, sending more to the bottom line and helping blunt the impact of the lost sales to China. Nvidia's cash stockpile has grown over the past year, with cash and marketable securities of $53.7 billion, an increase of 71%. Free cash flow of $26.1 billion soared 75%. CEO Jensen Huang provided commentary about the future of the AI revolution, and the rock star chief executive didn't mince words: Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation. This pronouncement, combined with the company's robust business performance, helped drive Nvidia stock higher inafter-hours trading, with shares up more than 4% (as of this writing). Management expects the company's growth spurt to continue. Nvidia is guiding for record second-quarter revenue of $45 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 50%. This was largely in line with Wall Street's consensus estimates, but the devil is in the details. The number includes a loss of approximately $8 billion in its fiscal Q2 revenue from the H20 chips, thanks to the more stringent export requirements. Despite the hit to its growth, investors remain bullish on Nvidia stock. Shares are currently selling for roughly 32 times next year's expected earnings. While that's a modest premium, it's still an attractive price to pay for a company expected to grow its profits by 39% this fiscal year and 35% in its fiscal 2026 -- evenafterthe hit to China sales. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress revealed, \"Large cloud service providers remained our largest [customers] at just under 50% of data center revenue.\" A quick calculation reveals that 44% of Nvidia's total revenue is currently dependent on the world's largest cloud infrastructure providers, includingAmazonWeb Services,Microsoft's Azure Cloud, andAlphabet's Google Cloud. Honorable mention goes toMeta Platforms, which has also significantly scaled upcapital expenditures (capex)to build out its data centers. As evidenced by Nvidia's results, the data center build-out continues, and the world's largest tech companies and cloud providers havetelegraphed their intentionto continue the heavy spending that has characterized the build-out of AI infrastructure. Nvidia continues to dominate the data center GPU market, with more than 90% of the market. For long-term investors, this quarter is one data point in a long track record of impressive execution. Nvidia remains at the heart of the AI revolution, which illustrates that the stock likely hasmuchhigher to go from here. It continues to be one of my highest-conviction stocks.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang touted the company's plans to manufacture its AI chips in the US, while warning against export controls that limit its ability to ship products to China. Huang made the comments during Nvidia's fiscal first quarterearnings call on Wednesday, saying that he expects the company to build everything from chips to supercomputers in America by the end of the year. To do that, Huang explained, Nvidia is working with Taiwanese companies ranging from TSMC and Foxconn to Winstron to manufacture its various components. \"To encourage and support these investments, we've made substantial long-term purchase commitments, a deep investment in America's AI manufacturing future,\" Huang said during the call. Huang's statements come after President Trump criticized Apple for not moving iPhone manufacturing to America and threatened to add a25% tariff to the company's productsif it doesn't commit to such a move. While Huang said he agrees with Trump's desire to bring manufacturing back to the US, he warned against the administration's decision to ban Nvidia chip sales to China, saying that the AI platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. \u201cChina is one of the world\u2019s largest AI markets and a springboard to AI success,\u201d Huang said, adding that China\u2019s AI will move on with or without US-made chips like Nvidia\u2019s. Nvidia announced that the Trump administration banned sales of itsH20 chip to China in Apriland reported a $4.5 billion revenue impact in its first fiscal quarter. The company says it will also miss out on $8 billion worth of H20 revenue in its second quarter. What\u2019s more, Nvidia says it can no longer build chips on its Hopper platform to manufacture chips for China. The company's Hopper line is the predecessor to Nvidia\u2019s current Blackwell chips. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to meet the Biden administration's restrictions on AI chips destined for China. But DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Washington and Wall Street when it proved it could produce powerful AI models using below top-of-the-line Nvidia chips. As a result, President Trump imposed tighter restrictions on the company's chips, banning the sale of H20s in the country. Huang, however, said it\u2019s not just about selling hardware into China. \u201cThe AI race isn\u2019t just about chips,\u201d he said, adding that the more important aspect of the US-China AI battle is the software stack that companies build on. Huang has previously laid out how important it is for Nvidia to continue to compete in China, explaining that the country has half of the world\u2019s AI developers and that driving those workers to build on Chinese chips would hurt not just Nvidia, but also the US\u2019 national security goals. Though Nvidia is unable to sell into China, it did win a reprieve from the Biden administration\u2019s planned AI diffusion rules. Those regulations would have created a three-tier system broken down by countries that can freely purchase chips, those that needed licenses to buy them, and those that were banned from ordering chips. But the Trump administration tossed out those rules before they were scheduled to go into place this month. Still, it plans to introduce its own regulations sometime in the future. Nvidia also benefited from Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East, with the company set to sell hundreds of thousands ofchips to Saudi Arabiaandthe United Arab Emirates, as part of those countries\u2019 own sovereign AI plans, or AI services operated and funded by governments rather than individual independent companies.

CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino joins Yahoo Finance's Nvidia earnings special to have a conversation aboutthe expectations for Nvidia's business in China, the chipmaker's full-year guidance, and the positive signs he is seeing from AI players and the broader artificial intelligence landscape following investment deals from Middle East countries. Stay tuned for Yahoo Finance's special live coverage of Nvidia's first quarter earningshere, beginning at 4:15 p.m. on Wednesday, May 28. In video sharing and the call the China impacts due to changes in export controls for the second quarter, the chipmaker expecting a loss in A20 revenue of approximately $8 billion. But Jensen just saying at the conclusion of the call that while they are thinking about developing an alternative product to be able to sell into the Chinese market, they are not, they don't have anything that they wanted to announce today. To discuss more on what this all means for in video, let's get to CFRA research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino. Angelo, congrats, you made it through the call, so did we. So, what do you, uh, what do you make of uh, uh, of NVIDIA and particularly the the China situation? Yeah, I mean I think overall, you've got to be pretty optimistic where NVIDIA is sitting right now. I mean the guidance, I mean the results in itself are perfectly fine, um, solid results, the, the guidance, you know, when you kind of try to dissect it, you mean, you alluded to the $8 billion in lost revenue there, um, from China, which essentially indicates that, um, the U, the, the non China business is running well ahead of expectations. Because most of us were looking at about a four to five billion dollar hit for the July quarter tied to China. So the fact that, you know, you, you're likely running a couple of billion ahead of expectations in China. As far as, um, China itself is concerned, listen, um, I think what you're getting here now is almost a de-risking of China in the fact that, hey, listen, um, you would have been potentially 8 billion above the current run rate. But the fact of the matter is, um, you now don't necessarily need to worry about another leg down driven by China. And in fact, if we were to see some sort of good news, um, and we don't think NVIDIA is going and Jensen is going to give up on China. Um, so we would expect them to at some point, um, find their way back into China. Um, once they do, that is a potential catalyst, um, for the shares. Angelo, I know you're, you know, you got to buy on this name, but when you're talking to your clients and they ask you, hey, what are the key risks I need to think about before committing capital to NVIDIA? You tell them what, Angelo? Yeah, I mean there's a lot of risks that are still on the table. I mean I'd say right now, um, you know, there, there are still geopolitical risks that you still need to take into account, tariff oriented risks. I mean there, we do have a pending 232 semiconductor investigation that is going on at this point where we expect to get some clarity on it here over the next couple of weeks or months. Once we get, um, you know, further information on that, there is going to be a tariff, right? On, um, technology products out there, you know, on the, on the hardware side of things. NVIDIA largely now is hardware oriented in nature. We think they're going to be able to obviously pass through a lot of those costs. But nonetheless, it is a potential headwind that's looming out there at some point in time. But still we need to find out, um, get some clarity on that side of things. That's the other thing, um, you know, when we look out here over the next couple of quarters or years, years, the trajectory of AI demand, um, I think was more of a concern maybe two months ago. But nonetheless, um, we're seeing a lot of supply growth in terms of, um, extra compute capacity getting added into the market, not only from the hyperscalers, but you know, from these tier two, three providers, whether they'd be the core weaves, the, you know, the stargates of the world. And if we would get to a point where, you know, that capacity, that supply growth exceeds the demand growth, um, that you know, clearly becomes worrisome for the AI trade. But I don't think that's something you necessarily have to worry about here clearly over the next couple of quarters, especially given what Jensen just talked about in terms of the emergence of these reasoning models, what they're doing, uh, you know, with AI agents and the demand that's providing for compute here. So one of the questions I have is in terms of some of these other areas that you just were referring to, um, what, you know, to counter Josh's question, what are some of the positive things that you're telling people who are calling you that you're seeing? You referred to some of those things, but what are the other growth areas? Like one of the things we were talking about earlier is the fact that, you know, we're really not seeing anything on the robotics side just yet from a revenue perspective. I think there's some other opportunities out there. Any other things like that that you're seeing that you think are positives? Yeah, so I, I think, you know, when it comes to AI, you've got to, you know, walk before you can run, right? I mean you look at 23, 2023, 2024, those were kind of the years of generative AI. You've now got this inflection here in 2025 which we think will spill into 2026, which is kind of this shift towards AI agents, more complex reasoning models. And I think 2027, 2028 will be the, the bigger opportunity, um, and you know, massive wave in terms of the physical AI world. Um, so you'll probably see some signs of that obviously here over the next year or two, but the, the greater momentum we think is probably, you know, three to five years away in time. But nonetheless, you know, there are clearly catalysts, you know, towards the growth of compute out there. Um, I'd say also think about sovereign AI more and more nowadays, um, especially after the Saudi Arabia deal, um, that we just saw. I think you're going to see, um, a lot more deal making, um, here over the next couple of quarters. And I wouldn't necessarily, you know, be surprised if you saw more NVIDIA, um, you know, in some of these deals that get announced out there in terms of, um, being used as a bargaining chip. And that's clearly going to be a potential catalyst, um, for a company like NVIDIA and the broader, um, AI ecosystem.",

Nvidia reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share on revenue that jumped 69% year-over-year to a record $44.06 billion.\u00a0The gains came as sales from Nvidia's data center segment, representing the bulk of the company's revenue, grew 73% to a record $39.1 billion.(Investopedia'slive coverage of the resultsis here.) \u201cGlobal demand for NVIDIA\u2019s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a release, adding \u201cAI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate.\u201d Nvidia's quarterly sales exceeded analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, but earnings did not, as the company said it absorbed a $4.5 billion charge in the period due to restrictions on the sale of its H20 chips to China, less than the$5.5 billionthe company said it anticipated last month. Without the charge and related tax impact, Nvidia said it would have reported EPS of 96 cents, above estimates. In the current quarter, Nvidia said it expects to take an $8 billion hit due to lost revenue from H20 sales. The chipmaker projected quarterly revenue of $45 billion, plus or minus 2%, and slightly below Street expectations. Shares of Nvidia surged over 5% to just above $141 in after-hours trading following the results, its highest level since February. If Nvidia can sustain those gains, it could surpass Microsoft (MSFT) tomorrow as the world's most valuable company bymarket capitalization.
