The development was good news for the sports apparel and equipment giant, which generated 15% of its revenue from China in its latest quarter and relies on the country as a major globalsupply chainhub. Analysts at Jefferies recently pointed out that large companies such as Nike could see significantly fewer costs as trade discussions progress, despite having planned for higher hefty import duties,Barron'sreported. Nike shares slumped as much as 37% between late February and early April amid concerns that tariffs could significantly increase production costs, leading to increased pressure on the company\u2019sprofit margins. However, a more optimistic trade outlook has seen the stock rebound 20% from last month\u2019s low as of Monday\u2019s close. The stock gained more than 7% on Monday to close at $62.58. Below, we take a closer look at Nike\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify crucial price levels worth watching out for. Since gapping sharply lower in early April, Nike shares consolidated within anascending trianglebefore breaking out above the pattern\u2019s uppertrendlinein Monday\u2019s trading session. Importantly, Monday's move occurred on above-averagevolume, indicating buying conviction by larger market participants. Moreover, the breakout saw therelative strength indexcross back above the neutral threshold to signal bullish price momentum. Let\u2019s identify three crucial overhead areas on Nike\u2019s chart to watch and also point out a keysupport levelto monitor during potential retracements. Firstly, it\u2019s worth watching the $63 level. The shares may face overheadresistancein this area near the downward sloping50-day moving averageand a series of prices that preceded the stock\u2019s early-April gap. This location also matches the 38.2%Fibonacci retracement levelwhen applying a grid from the stock\u2019s February high to April low. A decisive close above this area could see the shares make a move higher to around $71. Investors who haveaccumulated sharesat recent lows may look forprofit-takingopportunities in this location near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and several prominent troughs that formed on the chart between July and February. Furtherupsidein the stock may propel a move toward $79. This location could provide selling pressure near ahorizontal linethat links a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to late June last year. Upon retracements in Nike shares, it\u2019s worth keeping a close eye on the key $59 level. Investors may look forentry pointson a retest to the ascending triangle\u2019s upper trendline, which may flip from an area of prior resistance to a region of future support.

        "content": "While a rising tide lifts all boats, an ebbing tide causes boats to move lower. A similar effect is seen with the stock market. When the major market indexes decline, so do most stocks. However, one positive side effect is that these stocks become more attractively valued. We've seen this happen in 2025 with the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Every member of this once-high-flying group has taken a hit during the overall market sell-off, with their valuations falling as a result. Google parentAlphabet(GOOG3.35%)(GOOGL3.65%)is now the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. But you might be surprised which stock ranks as the second-cheapest. Image source: Getty Images. Investors use many valuation metrics. Three of the most widely used are the trailing-12-monthprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, theforward P/E ratio, and theprice-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. The table shows how the Magnificent Seven stocks compare on each of these metrics: Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Valuations as of May 12, 2025. As you can see, Alphabet ranks as the least expensive Magnificent Seven stock on all three valuation metrics. The tech giant's share price has been especially beaten down because of antitrust lawsuit rulings against it and worries that artificial intelligence (AI) could disrupt its Google Search business. Meta Platforms is the second-cheapest of the group based on trailing P/E and forward P/E. This is particularly notable because the stock has held up better than most of the other Magnificent Seven stocks during the stock market tumult this year. Interestingly, though, Nvidia claims the second-lowest PEG ratio after Alphabet. This metric, by the way, is based on analysts' five-year earnings growth projections. Nvidia's shares have sold off significantly on investors' concerns about the negative impact of the Trump administration'stariffsand trade restrictions on exports of AI chips to China. I like using the PEG ratio for growth stocks. However, there's one major drawback to the metric: Estimating future earnings growth is tricky. If Wall Street's growth estimates for Alphabet and Nvidia are way off, the PEG ratios could be all but useless. With Alphabet, the reliability of analysts' growth projections depends largely on what happens with the federal antitrust lawsuits. Unfortunately, no one knows what the final resolution of those cases will be. The worst-case scenario is that the company is forced to divest some of its businesses. The best-case scenario is that Alphabet wins on appeal. The other main threat to Alphabet is that AI could cause a significant slump in Google Search advertising revenue. That could happen. On the other hand, Google seems to be doing a good job of incorporatinggenerative AIinto Google Search already. The company could navigate the transition to AI search better than rivals. What about Nvidia? Two assumptions are critical to growth estimates for theGPUmaker. First, demand for AI chips must continue to grow robustly. Second, Nvidia must stay ahead of increasing competition. I think the first assumption is a relatively safe one. We're still only in the early innings of AI adoption. As for the second assumption, Nvidia has several deep-pocketed rivals (including some of its customers, such as Google). However, I expect that the company will remain at the forefront of AI chip innovation. Investing in any stock comes with some level of risk. Alphabet and Nvidia are no exceptions. The key question investors must ask before buying the stocks is: Are the opportunities for reward worth the risk? I think the answer is \"yes\" for both Alphabet and Nvidia. My hunch is that fears about antitrust litigation and AI search hurting Google are overblown. I predict that AI will remain a huge tailwind for the company. I also think that Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo will become a major growth driver over the next decade. And I'm also optimistic about Nvidia's long-term prospects. Potential breakthroughs in AI, perhaps even artificial general intelligence (AGI), could accelerate the demand for GPUs. Nvidia is investing heavily in research and development and should retain its market leadership. Alphabet and Nvidia are the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks for solid reasons. However, I think they're both smart picks for aggressive investors.",

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar After May 28",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA5.41%)added an eye-popping $2.5 trillion to its market capitalization since the start of 2023, thanks to surging sales of its data center chips, which are the best in the world for processing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. However, Nvidia stock is down 22% from its all-time high as investors try to navigate growing tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners. Although semiconductors are exempt from President Donald Trump's tariffs, investors fear trade tensions could cause an economic slowdown, which will force Nvidia's customers to spend less money on chips and components. Based on the recent guidance investors received from some of the most powerful AI companies, there is no sign of a spending slowdown just yet. But investors will receive an important update on May 28, when Nvidia releases its financial results for its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27). Here's why I think its stock will soar following the report. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) was the hottest data center chip on the market forAIdevelopers in 2023, giving the company a staggering 98% market share that year. It continued to dominate sales in 2024, but developers are now lining up for Nvidia's newer chips, which are based on its Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra architectures. The new Blackwell Ultra GB300 -- which will start shipping in the second half of this year -- can deliver up to 50 times more performance than the H100 in certain configurations, making it ideal for next-generation \"reasoning\" AI models. These new models spend more time \"thinking\" in the background than traditionallarge language models(LLMs), cleaning up potential errors to deliver the most accurate responses to the end user. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says reasoning models need 100 times more computing power to offset the additional tokens (words, punctuation, and symbols) they consume, and to speed up the thinking process -- otherwise, users might abandon them because they are too slow to render responses. This growing need for additional computing capacity will help support Nvidia's sales for years to come, and global trade tensions are unlikely to stand in the way. Meta Platforms,Amazon,Microsoft, andAlphabetare four of Nvidia's top customers. They entered 2025 expecting to spend approximately $320 billion combined on AI data center infrastructure and chips, but Wall Street was recently concerned that tariffs would impact their core businesses, and force them to lower their forecast capital expenditures (capex). However, those four companies recently reported their latest quarterly financial results, andnoneof them slashed their capex plans. In fact,Meta Platformsrevised its forecast capex range upward to between $64 billion and $72 billion, from a previous range of $60 billion to $65 billion. Nvidia's guidance suggests its fiscal 2026 first-quarterrevenuewill come in at around $43 billion, representing 65% growth compared to the year-ago period. If previous quarters are anything to go by, the data center segment will represent around 90% of the company's total revenue. This is where sales of AI GPUs and components are accounted for. According to Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance), Nvidia could also deliverearnings per share(EPS) of $0.89 during the first quarter, which would be a 46% increase from the year-ago period. This is an important number for investors to watch, because it influences the company's stock price and valuation. Wall Street analysts will also be laser-focused on Nvidia's guidance for the current fiscal 2026 second quarter, because it will tell them whether the company expects at leastsomecustomers to start pulling back on their AI spending due to theeconomic uncertainty triggered by global trade tensions. Analysts will be looking for total revenue guidance of around $46.4 billion, based on the consensus compiled by Yahoo!. A forecast below that figure could result in a sell-off in Nvidia stock. Although investor fears about economic headwinds pushed Nvidia stock down 22% from its all-time high, I think its Q1 financial report on May 28 could set the stage for a sustained upside move, especially if Huang officially puts those concerns to bed. Valuation is a key reason why. Based on the company's fiscal 2025 EPS of $2.99, its stock trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof nearly 40 as of this writing, which is a steep discount to its 10-year average of 59.7. Plus, Wall Street expects Nvidia to deliver $4.41 in EPS during fiscal 2026, placing the stock at aforward P/E ratioof 26.4. In other words, the stock would have to soar by 126% over the next year just to trade in line with its 10-year average P/E ratio of 59.7.  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts But the long-term picture looks even more exciting. At Nvidia's GTC conference in March, Huang told the audience he expects annual data center spending to reach $1 trillion by 2028, primarily because of the computing power required by reasoning models. On that note, Nvidia might even provide an update on its upcoming Rubin GPU architecture on May 28, which could deliver a further increase in performance of 3.3 times compared to Blackwell Ultra. It's expected to officially launch sometime next year, and it'll pave the way for developers to create even more advanced reasoning models. Simply put, I think the May 28 report will not only put short-term sales concerns to bed, but it will also remind investors that Nvidia is looking to dominate the AI industry for years to come.",

        "header": "What Lessons Can Investors Learn From Cathie Wood's Ark Invest's Aggressive Investment Philosophy?",
        "content": "Cathie Wood has become best known for a relatively aggressive investment philosophy. She and her team at Ark Invest target companies promoting cutting-edge technologies, which bring with them high risks but the potential for considerable rewards. This differs from investors like Warren Buffett, who focuses on premium stocks at fair prices, or Carl Icahn, who buys large stakes in companies to encourage changes in the business. Nonetheless, the investing world offers numerous paths to success. The question at hand is whether Wood's approach can work for investors, and that requires a closer look at her philosophy, along with the results delivered. Image source: Getty Images. Wood's approach stands out by focusing on companies leading the way in innovation and operatingexchange-traded funds(ETFs) around that theme. Admittedly, this has been a wise philosophy, as companies likeAmazonandNetflixmade some small investors wealthy by pioneering new industries. Wood and her team at Ark Invest focus specifically on five key areas of innovation: Indeed, economic history bodes well for her approach. If one looks back 100 years, innovations such as the automobile, airplane, and telephone dramatically changed people's lives and made some investors wealthy. Today's technology could do the same. Wood and her team have benefited from notable successes. Seeing the potential for blockchain early, Ark Invest purchasedBitcoinin the $250 per coin range. Today, the market values each coin above $95,000. The same goes for early picks likeTesla, which Wood first purchased in January 2015 at a split-adjusted price of around $13 per share. Wood was also an early bull onNvidiaand began buying in Q4 2016 at a split-adjusted price of around $2.10 per share. Both have contributed to the advancement of artificial intelligence and robotics and, in Tesla's case, energy storage. Ark Invest's initial Tesla investment is up nearly 2,100%, while its first Nvidia shares climbed by approximately 5,200%. However, other investments, particularly those geared toward AI, have not necessarily fared well. In 2022, Ark Invest speculated thatZoom Video Communicationswould reach $1,500 per share by 2026. Amid slow growth, Ark Invest later closed its Zoom position. The company also owned more than 21 million shares ofTeladoc Health. Now, with that stock down around 98% from its high, Ark Invest has since sold all its shares. Ark Invest's holdings have also not fared well overall more recently, though this was not always the case. In early 2021, during the peak of the 2020-2021 bull market, total returns for theArk Innovation ETF(ARKK5.98%)had climbed by around 1,000% over the last five years. Unfortunately, the 2022 bear market appeared to catch the company off guard, and the ETF never recovered. Over the last five years, the Ark Innovation ETF's total return isdownby nearly 6%, and that includes an 11% gain over the previous year. Worse, the Ark Innovation ETF has anETF expense ratioof 0.75%, well above the average estimated by Fidelity at 0.48%. Although investors might overlook that expense ratio with 1,000% gains, the Ark Innovation ETF is a hard sell when investors pay that fee to lose money. Overall, the history of Ark Invest seems to bode poorly for trying to build an innovation-only portfolio. Indeed, life-changing innovations bode well for investors and the public in general. Investors have become wealthy by buying into specific innovations and their corresponding companies. Unfortunately, the hard part is picking the right companies. Wood and her team had great success with Bitcoin, Nvidia, and Tesla, and could see further success with other innovative stocks in the future. However, the negative returns of the Ark Innovation ETF show that the search for innovation will often result in negative returns. Although investors should still consider buying stocks leading the way in innovation, going all-in on Cathie Wood's investing philosophy may not be the best choice.",

Honda Director, President, and Representative Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe explained in the call with analysts that the tariffs would have a negative impact of JPY650 billion ($4.40 billion) in the current fiscal year. \"I think the tariff impact will continue to change as time goes by, and we have to think about these major changes taking place,\" Mibe said, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. Mibe noted that Honda was already looking at ways to respond, saying that \"if the tariff measures are to be in place for a long time, then we will have to increase our production capacity in the United States.\" Mibe also pointed out that its plan announced in April 2024 of an EV operation in Canada would be put on hold for at least two years since \"in North America, the EV market growth is slowing down.\" Despite today's losses, U.S.-listed shares of Hondo Motor are up slightly year-to-date.

        "content": "ReplacingWarren Buffettis perhaps the ultimate poisoned chalice. With him at the helm, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A,BRK.B) hasdelivered a staggering total returnof more than 5.5 million percent to shareholders since Buffett took over the company in 1965. That track record, combined with his down-to-earth, humble personality, transformed Buffett into a Wall Street icon and the most famous investor on the planet. His replacement, Greg Abel, has the biggest shoes in finance to fill and a job that is, some would argue, impossible to succeed in. Buffett\u00a0handpickedAbelto replace him. The 62-year-old Canadian has worked at Berkshire for 25 years and is currently the chair and CEO of its energy business and the vice-chairman of its non-insurance operations. Abel began his career as an accountant, then in 1992 joined utilities company CalEnergy, which would eventually be acquired by Berkshire Hathaway. Under Abel\u2019s leadership, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s energy business grew into a large utility conglomerate and a key money generator. Abel\u2019s operational discipline, leadership, and regular guy personality helped him rise through the ranks. Buffett says he\u2019s a better manager than him, while his trusted business partner and the so-called architect of Berkshire\u2019s success,Charlie Munger, described him as \u201csensational at being a business leader,\u201d \u201csensationally good at smoothly getting things done through other people,\u201d and \u201ca tremendous learning machine.\u201d Investors like the idea of Buffett managing their money. When he goes, that appeal and the so-called \u201cBuffett premium\u201d tacked onto Berkshire\u2019s valuation to account for its boss\u2019s star power could disappear. Abel\u2019s credentials, references, and the fact that he was handpicked personally by Buffett have helped calm investors\u2019 nerves. He\u2019s been molded to take over for a long time and has Berkshire and its culture ingrained in him. The biggest issue isinvestor sentiment. Abel has the experience to keep growing Berkshire and will be flanked by very able advisors, including Buffett himself. However, he doesn\u2019t have the cult-like following of his predecessor\u2014in the week after the official announcement of the handover, Berkshire's stock price dropped about 5%. No matter how well Abel does, he\u2019ll likely never match Buffett\u2019s popularity\u2014who could? The timing is tricky, too. There\u2019s a lot of cash on thebalance sheetinvestors want to see spent, expectations are high, bigger risks need to be taken to move the dial, and Buffett and Berkshire\u2019s investment philosophy isn\u2019t as fashionable as it used to be. Buffett has said he chose Abel to succeed him because they share similar values. They both believe invalue investing, long-term thinking, cash generation, and robust balance sheets. Abel told the media he has no plans to make major changes in Berkshire's operations. One of the biggest differences is their management styles. Abel is said to be much more hands-on than Buffett. The positive aspect is that Abel is known for getting the most out of businesses. The downside is that Berkshire has long succeeded by offering the companies it acquires quasi-independence. Abel knows Berkshire Hathaway inside out and has the experience and credentials to succeed as itsCEO. The people who work with him sing his praises, and Buffett even claims he\u2019ll do a better job than he did.The problem is not just about investment acumen. Buffett is loved. Knowing he\u2019s calling the shots drew hordes of investors to buy shares in Berkshire. Take that away, and, for many, the company is losing its most valuable asset.",

The deal, which is still being negotiated and could change, would let the UAE import 500,000 of the most advanced chips on the market each year from now to 2027, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Department of Commerce and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.

        "content": "The race to establish \"Y'all Street\" as a legitimate competitor to the duopoly of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) andNasdaqon Wall Street has kicked into high gear, with billions in potential listing fees at stake.NYSE Texas openedin Dallas in March 2025, securing Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. (DJT) as its first listing, while the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) has secured $161 million in backing from giants like BlackRock, Inc. (BLK) for a 2026 launch. \"Texas's $2.7 trillion economy is very large (second in the U.S., eighth in the world) and rapidly-growing (fastest-growing large state in the U.S.),\" B\u00fclent Temel, professor of economics at the University of Texas at San Antonio, noted to Investopedia. \"It means more and more companies are growing to reach the scale to go public to accelerate their growth. Getting listed and traded in a local Texas exchange would likely be these companies' first choice as it is good PR for them in a state's common culture that rewards localness.\" Regional exchanges once operated across America, but by the late 20th century, regulatory changes and technological advances had solidified the NYSE-Nasdaq duopoly, with the last of the five regional exchanges swept away by consolidation from 2006 to 2009. Attempts by others to carve out market share by focusing onhigh-frequency trading (HFT)largely went nowhere in the 2010s. Backers of the TXSE say this time is different. The state has drawn in hundreds of major companies with its low taxes, looser regulations, and thriving economy, including high-profile relocations by Tesla (TSLA), Oracle Corp. (ORCL), and Chevron Corporation (CVX). Adding to all this, traditional exchanges face fierce competition from alternative trading systems. According to CBOE data,off-exchange trading venuesnow account for 51% of U.S. equities volume, compared with 18% for NYSE and 14% for Nasdaq\u2014an increase of about 20% since 2020.This shift largely stems from the rise ofdark pools,payment-for-order-flowarrangements, and trade matching among large institutional investors. In January 2025, TXSE filed its 4,000-page Form 1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, officially beginning the regulatory approval process with $161 million in capital.The exchange plans to launch its trading operations in early 2026, with listings becoming available by the end of that year. The NYSE, recognizing the growing threat, relocated its Chicago operations to avoid the lengthy process of developing a newexchangefrom scratch, opening NYSE Texas in Dallas in March 2025, giving it the coveted first-mover advantage in the state. Despite regulations for securities being national and trading that's done electronically, Temel said being a local matters. \"Arguably more so than other U.S. states, Texas has a common culture that is proud of its differences ... and its business acumen,\" he said. \"This social psychology will likely pave the way for increasing numbers of Texans to invest in stocks using their local exchanges. Coupled with the fact that the average discretionary income has been rising in Texas, these cultural dynamics signal a bright future for the new exchanges in Dallas.\" Dallas now ranks as the second-largest financial hub in the U.S. by number of finance employees.The southeastern U.S., TXSE\u2019s primary market, is home to 1,500 publicly traded companies and more than 5,200 private equity-backed firms, many of which are eyeingpublic market access. NYSE Texas hit the ground running with established regulatory approvals and infrastructure as part of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE), giving it immediate global recognition and existing relationships with listed companies. TXSE, while backed by major players like BlackRock and Citadel, must build from scratch\u2014a challenge that its backers frame as an opportunity to implement more efficient systems without legacy constraints. Perhaps most striking is their divergent approach to listing standards. NYSE Texas follows its parent company's established criteria, while TXSE said it's going to institute significantly stricter requirements, with TXSE CEO James Lee saying these standards would exclude about 1,700 companies currently listed on NYSE and Nasdaq, a bold strategy that prioritizes quality over quantity. TXSE represents the most serious challenge to the NYSE/Nasdaqduopolyin decades. Its unprecedented financial backing, Texas's growing economic clout, and the increasing fragmentation of equity markets provide advantages earlier challengers lacked. \"There is an unsatisfied demand for stock trading, if not a need per se for local exchanges in Texas,\" Temel said. \"Distinct features of Texas ... create opportunities for many private companies to go public, many public ones to also trade their stocks in Texas, and many more citizens and institutional investors to invest in Texas's exchanges.\"",

Nvidia shares rose nearly 6% to close just under $130. The gains put Nvidia\u2019smarket capitalizationat nearly $3.2 trillion, more than every other U.S. company aside from Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Nvidia on Tuesday announceda partnership with Humain, an AI subsidiary of Saudi Arabia\u2019ssovereign wealth fund. Nvidia will sell Humain \u201cseveral hundred thousand\u201d advanced GPUs over the next five years, starting with an AI supercomputer powered by 18,000 GB300 chips.The announcement coincided with the beginning of President Trump\u2019sfour-day tour through the Middle East, the first major international trip of his second term. Nvidia became only the third U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market valuein June 2024. The AI chipmaker's path to that milestone looked very different than the two companies that preceded it, Microsoft and Apple. Its shares began a near-constant $3 trillion ascent in late 2022 when the release of ChatGPT sparked the generative AI boom. It was around the time Nvidia topped $3 trillion that the stock\u2019s meteoric rise gave way to a more volatile sideways drift. Still, it competed with Apple and Microsoft for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company throughout the remainder of the year before its market cap topped out at about $3.66 trillion in early January. The stock has been on a wild ride since. The company lost about $1.3 trillion in value between early January and early April as Wall Street questioned boththe economics of AIand how President Trump\u2019s trade war with China wouldaffect sales. The stock has rebounded in the last month, driven higher bysolid earnings reportsfrom big tech and the White House\u2019ssoftened stanceon tariffs.

        "content": "Softinflation dataand amajor AI deallifted U.S. stock indexes Tuesday, except for one notable exception: theDow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index that for many is synonymous with \u201cthe stock market.\u201d The Dow fell 0.6% on Tuesday, while theS&P 500and theNasdaq Compositeadvanced 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively. Health care giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was the culprit behind the Dow\u2019s sluggish day. Sharesplummeted nearly 18%after the company said its CEO would step down for personal reasons, and suspended its full-year guidance, citing unexpectedly high healthcare costs. The reason for the divergence in the performance of major indexes lies in the Dow\u2019s peculiar construction. The index, composed of 30 of America\u2019s largest companies, isprice-weighted, meaning the stock with the highest share price has the greatest impact on the index\u2019s level throughout the day. On the other hand, the S&P 500 is acapitalization-weightedindex in which the companies with the largest market caps have the most influence. The two indexes contain the same stocks\u2014granted, there are an extra 470 in the S&P 500\u2014but those stocks have vastly different weights within the indexes. Apple (AAPL), with its $3.1 trillion market cap, is the second-most valuable company in the world, and thus the second-largest stock in the S&P 500. But its share price of about $210 ranked it 16th in the Dow as of Monday's close. That gives it less sway within the index than companies a fraction of its size, like the Travelers Companies (TRV), with its $268 share price and $60 billion market cap. UnitedHealth entered Tuesday with the third-highest share price of any company in the Dow, behind just Goldman Sachs (GS) and Microsoft (MSFT). Thus, UnitedHealth's slump detracted about 420 points from the Dow, accounting for all of its 270-point loss. Today was thesecond timein the past month that a sharp drop in UnitedHealth shares single-handedly pulled down the Dow. The stock plunged 22% on April 17, itsworst day since 1998, after thecompany reported weak first-quarter resultsand cut its full-year profit forecast.

        "content": "Shares of apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) dropped in extended trading Tuesday after the company pulled its 2025 outlook, saying its first-quarter results were \"clearly\" disappointing. American Eagle's shares, which rose more than 5% in Tuesday's regular session, were recently off 15% in late trading, pointing toward prices just a bit above year-to-date lows. The company, in an afternoon press release, said first-quarterrevenuewas expected to fall about 5% year-over-year, with comparable-store sales off about 3%. In March, it told investors to expect a \"mid-single digit\" decline in first-quarter revenue, along with a \"low-single digit\" dropoff for the year.Executives at the time said the quarter was off toa slower-than-expected start, but anticipated trends might improve heading into the spring. American Eagle, which said it plans to report full results later this month, said those numbers would reflect \"higher than planned promotional activity in the quarter\" and a roughly $75 million charge associated with awrite-down of spring and summer goods. \u201cWe are clearly disappointed with our execution in the first quarter,\" CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a statement. \"Merchandising strategiesdid not drive the results we anticipated.\" American Eagle shares are down roughly 24% in 2025 through Tuesday's close.",

        "content": "Coinbase (COIN) shares skyrocketed on Tuesday following newsthe cryptocurrency exchange will be added to the S&P 500. Coinbase,the largest crypto exchange in U.S., will replace Discover Financial Services (DFS) in the benchmark index before trading opens next Monday, marking a major milestone for the company, whichwent publicin April 2021. The inclusion comes less than a week after the company said that it had agreed to acquire Deribit, acrypto optionsexchange, for $2.9 billion in cash and stock, the same day itposted first-quarter earningsthat came in below Wall Street expectations. Coinbase shares jumped 24% on Tuesday to close at around $257. With that move, the stock has inched into positive territory for 2025, rebounding from an early-April low of around $142. Below, we break down thetechnicalson the Coinbase chart and point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. Coinbase shares forged aninverse head and shoulders patternon the chart between March and May, with the price staging a decisivebreakoutabove the formation\u2019snecklineon Tuesday. Even before today's rally, the stock had registered higher-than-averagevolumeover the previous three trading sessions, indicating that larger market participants hadaccumulated sharesin preparation for a significant price move. Let\u2019s identify key overhead areas on the Coinbase chart to watch amid the potential for further upside and also locate a majorsupport levelworth monitoring during possible declines. The $245 level was a key area to watch coming into Tuesday's session as it was near two closely aligned troughs that formed on the chart in December and January. With that level comfortably surpassed, shares could climb to the $273 level. Investors who have bought at lower prices may look to place sell orders in this region near ahorizontal linethe connects a range ofpeaks and troughson the chart extending back to March last year. This level also corresponds with a measured moveprice targetthat calculates the depth of the inverse head and shoulders pattern inpointsand adds that amount to the formation\u2019s neckline. For example, adding $65 to $208 projects a target of $273. A more-bullish move higher may trigger arallytoward $330. This area on the chart could provide selling pressure near several peaks that developed on the chart just below the stock\u2019s December high. Duringretracementsin Coinbase shares, investors should monitor the $208 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest on a retest of the inverse head and shoulders\u2019 neckline, which may turn into a major support area after Tuesday\u2019s breakout.
