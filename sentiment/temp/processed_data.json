        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares come into the week trading at their highest levels in more than two months, as the stock has gained ground ineach of the last three weeks. The stock started gaining traction late last month after CEO Elon Musk, during the company\u2019sfirst quarter earningscall, said he wouldspend less time at the Department of Government Efficiency, or \"DOGE,\"and more time at his job at the company. More recently, Tesla shares received a boost after the Trump administration announceda trade agreement with the U.K. and suggested that more were on the way. Trade news will likely set the tone this week also after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greerflagged \"substantial progress,\"in U.S.-China trade talks held over the weekend, adding that details would be discussed on Monday. Tesla shares have recovered about 40% from last month\u2019s low.\u00a0However, the stock is still down 26% since the start of the year through Friday's close, due in part to concerns that Musk\u2019s involvement with the Trump administration could be weighing on the automaker\u2019s sales. Below, we take a closer look at Tesla\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto point out crucial price levels that investors will likely be watching. Tesla shares forged atriple bottomon the chart between early March and late April, setting the stage for a bullish reversal. Indeed, the stock confirmed the pattern in Friday\u2019s trading session, breaking out above the formation\u2019snecklineand closing above the closely watched200-day moving average (MA). Moreover, therelative strength indexsignals bullish price momentum and sits comfortably belowoverboughtlevels to provide ample room for further upside. Let\u2019s identify two crucial overhead areas on Tesla\u2019s chart where the shares may encounterresistanceand also locate keysupport levelsto monitor during future retracements. Tesla shares gained nearly 5% on Friday to around $298, the highest closing level since Feb. 25. Further buying this week could see Tesla bulls drive a move up to the $360 area. Investors who haveaccumulated sharesat lower prices may look forexit pointsat this location near a trendline that connects last year\u2019s November twin peaks with this year\u2019s Februarycountertrendswing high. Buying above this area may see a rally toward $430. This level on the chart could provide selling pressure near the Januarypeaks, which also closely align with the trough of the firstpullbackafter the stock set itsrecord highlast December. The first level to watch during retracements sits around $289. This area on the chart provides aconfluencefloor from the nearby 200-day MA and the triple bottom pattern\u2019s neckline, which may flip from an area of prior resistance into future support. Finally, selling below this level could see Tesla shares revisit lower support at the $225 level. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this region near the three prominent troughs that mark the triple bottom\u2019s low.

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia Just Received Its First Wall Street Sell Rating -- and More Will Follow After May 28",
        "content": "Although President Donald Trump's tariff policy has dominated the discussion on Wall Street over the last six weeks, it's the evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI)that's captivated investors for well over two years. In its simplest form, AI empowers software and systems with the capacity to reason and act on their own, as well as affords the potential to learn new skillsets without the need for human oversight. It's a game-changing technology with broad global application that the analysts at PwC believe can increase worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) $15.7 trillion by 2030. Image source: Getty Images. While an estimated $15.7 trillion addressable market leaves room for dozens, if not hundreds, of winners,no company has been a more direct beneficiary of the rise of AIthan semiconductor colossusNvidia(NVDA-0.62%). Almost overnight, Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) became the preferred \"brains\" powering enterprise AI-accelerated data centers. This has been followed up by the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture, which can further expedite compute needs and is more energy efficient than its predecessor. In just two fiscal years (Nvidia's fiscal year ends in late January), Nvidia's net sales skyrocketed from $27 billion to $130.5 billion. For context, Wall Street's consensus calls for nearly $201 billion in full-year sales for fiscal 2026 (this year) and $248 billion in fiscal 2027. Given Nvidia's supercharged growth rate and the fact that no other direct competitor has come remotely close to matching its combination of compute speed and energy efficiency, it's no surprise that Wall Street analysts have rallied around the stock market's AI darling. In late January, I noted that the dozens of Wall Street analysts covering Nvidiaall had respective price targets that was higher than where shares then traded. But times are a-changing! Nvidia just received its first Wall Street sell rating -- and after May 28, which is the date Nvidia will unveil its fiscal 2026 first-quarter operating results, I fully expect more analysts to follow suit. In late April, Seaport Research Partners' senior analyst Jay Goldberg initiated coverage on Nvidia with a $100 price target (a Wall Street low) and a sell rating. Though Goldberg acknowledged that Nvidia has done a lot right and its Blackwell GPU is highly sought-after, he believed the bull case was fully priced in, with numerous downside catalysts waiting in the wings. For one, Goldberg believes it'll be difficult for Nvidia to surpass Wall Street's lofty consensus expectations given that it's maxed out its order capacity for Blackwell in fiscal 2026. Even though world-leading chip fabrication companyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingis rapidly expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity-- CoWoS is essential for the packaging of high-bandwidth memory needed in AI-accelerated data centers -- it's still holding Nvidia back from selling even more of its next-gen hardware. Goldberg also anticipates that businesses will take a hard look at their spending later this year and into calendar year 2026. While Seaport's senior analyst doesn't expect an AI bubble to form and burst, he does believe that businesses are still in the process of feeling out real-world use cases for artificial intelligence. Goldberg suggests this willresult in slower AI spending/orders in the quarters to come. Additionally, and not surprisingly, Goldberg alluded to export restrictions to China as a front-and-center headwind. As a reminder, the Joe Biden Administration (since October 2022)andTrump administrationplaced stringent export restrictions on many high-powered AI chipsand related equipment to China. The world's No. 2 economy by GDP generates billions of dollars in quarterly sales for Nvidia, which could notably shrink if tariff-related uncertainty persists and trade relations between the U.S. and China sour. But I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg, and other Wall Street analysts will follow in Goldberg's footsteps once Nvidia's lifts the proverbial hood after the closing bell on May 28. Image source: Getty Images. Similar to Goldberg, I'm happy to give Nvidia credit where credit is due. The company's Hopper and Blackwell chips will likely maintain their compute advantages and remain sought-after hardware for AI data centers. But Nvidia's nearly $2.9 trillion valuation suggests it has big shoes to fill -- and there are more headwinds upcoming than Seaport's senior analyst has listed. Arguably thetop challenge for Nvidia is the internal competition it's contending with. While most investors and analysts focus on direct competitors likeAdvanced Micro Devicesand Huawei, they're completely missing that many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing AI chips and solutions to use in their data centers. Despite most of these companies noting that this internally developed hardware will work side-by-side with Nvidia's GPUs, it doesn't change the fact that this will lead to cheaper and more readily available AI solutions that aren't backlogged. It's a plain-as-day recipe for Nvidia to miss out on future data center market share. Equally important,Nvidia is losing its biggest competitive advantage; and no, I'm not talking about the compute speed of Hopper or Blackwell. Rather, I'm alluding to the benefits it's reaped from AI-GPU scarcity. Though Nvidia can't meet the overwhelming demand for its Blackwell GPU architecture, it's not stopping AMD from bringing less-costly next-generation chips to market. It's also not slowing the aforementioned internal innovation of Nvidia's top clients. As this hardware enters high-compute data centers, it reduces the AI-GPU scarcity and immense pricing power that fueled Nvidia's gross margin.  NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. One year ago, in fiscal 2025, Nvidia reported a scorching-hot generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin of 78.4%. Since then, its GAAP gross marginhas declined every quarter, and is expected to have fallen to an estimated 70.6% (+/- 50 basis points) for the fiscal first quarter, which it'll report on May 28. We're witnessing Nvidia's leading advantage wane before our eyes. Lastly, history would strongly suggest thatartificial intelligence won't escape a bubble-bursting event. Every next-big-thing technology or innovation for more than 30 years has endured a bubble early in its expansion phase. With an overwhelming majority of businesses not optimizing their AI solutions, or even generating a positive return on their AI investments, it once again appears that investors have overestimated the early innings utility of a game-changing technology. When more Wall Street analysts begin paying attention to these factors, I predict the number of sell ratings for Nvidia stock will climb.",

        "content": "Walmart (WMT) is set to report results for the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year early Thursday, with analysts bullish on the retail giant they see as a potential winner from continued tariff uncertainty. All 19 analysts who follow the company and are tracked by Visible Alpha currently call Walmart stock a \"buy,\" compared with 20 \"buy\" and one \"hold\" ratingsahead of the previous quarterly report. The stock has an average price target of $110.79, more than 14 % above Friday's closer and higher than its record close of $105.05 on Feb. 13. Walmart is expected to report a nearly 3% bump in revenue to $165.96 billion for the first quarter, while adjustedearnings per shareare expected to drop by 2 cents from thesame quarter a year agoto 58 cents. Analysts from Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer kept their respective \"buy\"-equivalentratingsin notes previewing Walmart's report. Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target to $110 from $100 and Morgan Stanley held firm at $115. Oppenheimer Wednesday said it would \"again be positioned to take advantage of weakness on the upcoming print vs. playing for a positive catalyst,\" as the stock's outperformance of the broader market so far this year and a potentially \"subdued\" first-quarter report could drive shares lower in the immediate aftermath. Morgan Stanley analysts said Tuesday that amid tariff uncertainty Walmart is \"among the best positioned in our coverage universe to navigate through these challenges, given its scale,supply chainadvantages, category mix and price gaps.\" They expect Walmart to widen its full-year outlook ranges. The retailer maintained its expectation of 3% to 4% sales growth for the first quarterlast month, but said its \"range of outcomes\" for operating income growth has widened for a number of reasons. Walmart topped estimates for theprior quarter, but its below-estimates forecasts sent shares lower.",

        "content": "Sometimes, valuable information regarding a company's prospects can be garnered from its peers and clients. That's the case with what tech giant and Google-ownerAlphabet's(GOOG-0.92%)management recently said on its earnings call. Here's a look at three discussion points from the earnings call that are great news forTesla(TSLA4.66%)andNvidia(NVDA-0.62%)investors. Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai remarked that he had received his first-ever question on its Waymo self-driving car business during the recent first-quarter earnings call. The question related to Waymo's long-term business model and the possibility of licensing, and his answer read well for Tesla investors. Pichai responded that Waymo could partner with automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and that \"there is future optionality around personal ownership as well.\" Pichai's comments help affirm Tesla's business model with robotaxis. While Tesla's Cybercab grabs much of the attention because it's a dedicated robotaxi concept with a potential price tag to match, the reality is that nearly all Tesla vehicles could become robotaxis. For example, the planned robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, in June won't be a Cybercab; it will be a Model Y with unsupervised autonomy. For reference, CEO Elon Musk believes Tesla will have unsupervised full-service driving (FSD) on personally owned cars by the end of the year. Waymo's consideration of licensing to automakers and potentially offering personal ownership of Waymo vehicles is in step with Tesla's plans and helps validate them. The difference is that Tesla already has the best-selling vehicle in the world (the Model Y) and is continually lowering its cost per vehicle. As Musk noted on Tesla's earnings call: \"Waymo's cars are very expensive, made in low volume. Teslas are probably one quarter, 20% of what a Waymo costs, and made in very high volume.\" Image source: Getty Images. If -- and it's a big if because Tesla has disappointed before on these issues -- Musk can get the robotaxi concept operational, roll it out as an option in the Tesla fleet, and get the Cybercab in production in 2026 as planned, there's significant upside potential for the stock. Aspreviously discussed, Tesla is a speculative growth stock, and it's priced as such. However, in most cases, you are generally buying into a growth story in a company with limited market experience and shaky finances, that is trying to introduce and get customers to adopt a new solution/technology. In Tesla's case, you are buying into the dominant player in electric vehicles, with the best-selling car in the world. Tesla is introducing its robotaxi concept, which has already been readily adopted, with a business model that its competitor just said it's considering adopting elements of. It's no secret that there have been fears of a slowdown in spending on data centers and other AI-related activities. That's a concern for a company like Nvidia that provides graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential in data centers to power artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC). Data centers are needed to support the growth inAIapplication use. The news thatMicrosoftwas holding back on some early-stage data center projects and had adjusted data center leases stoked those concerns. That said, it appears to be more of an issue for Microsoft to adjust its data center build-out and leasing to where demand is growing -- latency (which increases with distance) is an issue for data center location. In fact, Microsoft's management said it would be short of data center space in 2025. Alphabet's management also said that its AI products were growing \"at a rate that was much higher than the cloud's overall revenue growth rate\" of about 28%. It confirmed that it was still on track to make $75 billion in capital investments this year, with management expecting to deploy more capacity closer to the end of the year. In short, AI growth continues to be robust, and data center spending plans remain on track. That's great news for Nvidia's end markets, as Microsoft and Alphabet own two of the biggest data center hyperscalers in the market.",

        "content": "History doesn't normally repeat itself, but it often rhymes. So investors can take what has happened in the past as an indicator of what might happen in the future. With that in mind, a pattern seems to be developing withNvidia(NVDA-0.62%)stock: It has made large price gains in May in each of the past two years, and the way the stock is set up right now is reminiscent of how it looked before both of those jumps. That could be a sign for investors to buy it now. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia makesgraphics processing units (GPUs),which are fantastic tools for anyone looking to perform the types of computing tasks that can benefit from a lot of parallel processing power -- applications like displaying high-resolution video game graphics (the task they were originally designed for) and artificial intelligence (AI) model training. Demand for GPUs exploded in early 2023 as the race to build out data centers to support AI software kicked off. This led to a big jump in Nvidia's stock price in late May of that year after it reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 results and offered impressive guidance for fiscal Q2.  NVDAdata byYCharts. Fast-forward to May 2024. After Nvidia had already posted incredible results for an entire year, the market wasn't sure whether it could keep its growth rates up. However, it turned in another impressive fiscal Q1 report that sent the stock higher.  NVDAdata byYCharts. In May 2025, we're seeing a similar setup. Investors are worried that Nvidia won't be able to deliver the pace of growth they've become accustomed to -- though this time, their concerns are driven by factors such as President Donald Trump's tariffs and fears that a U.S. economic slowdown is imminent. As a result, it's heading toward that quarterly report well off its all-time high and trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio in the neighborhood of 26.  NVDAdata byYCharts. That's almost exactly the forward PE that Nvidia was trading at during the past two Mays. However, after reporting solid Q1 growth and giving an upbeat outlook for the rest of the year, the stock often starts to trade in the mid-30s to mid-40s range.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio. Because the current setup is nearly identical to the last two years, I'm fairly confident that Nvidia will experience a big share price jump following its fiscal Q1 report on May 28, as long as there are no unexpected announcements or revelations regarding new challenges. One headwind for Nvidia that appeared during this year's Q1 was the U.S. government's decision to limit which high-end chips can be exported to China. Because the export rules changed, Nvidia had to take a $5.5 billion writedown this quarter, which will affect its Q1 earnings. Those export restrictions could also drag on future demand. However, the statements by AI hyperscalers in their own recent Q1 reports indicated that they haven't changed their massive capital expenditure plans for data centers, mostly geared toward AI, despite the increasing macroeconomic headwinds generated byTrump's tariffs. The tens of billions of dollars they plan to spend on cloud infrastructure build-outs should give Nvidia the growth necessary to justify its current valuation and then some. Nvidia believes data center capital expenditures will reach $1 trillion annually by 2028, up from around $400 billion in 2024. If that turns out to be true, then there should still be a ton of long-term upside left in Nvidia's stock. But in the near term, Nvidia's stock may be primed for a big move after it reports earnings on May 28. With that in mind, picking up shares at their currentfairly cheap valuationlooks like it would be a lucrative move.",

        "content": "For investors that still have many years before retirement, growth stocks are one of the most efficient ways to increase their net worth. But the recent market sell-off is a good reminder that even the most promising companies can see their share prices fall in any given year. But investors should never judge the investment merits of a business by its stock performance, sincestocks can rise and fallfor all kinds of reasons in the near term. A lot of the day-to-day movement in the markets is driven by traders who have a much shorter time frame for making money than retirement savers do. SoundHound AI(SOUN-8.16%)andThe Trade Desk(TTD18.71%)are two growth stocks that fell hard this year. These companies just reported their first-quarter financial results. Let's look at what they reported, and whether it justifies at much lower prices than where they started 2025. Image source: Getty Images. SoundHound AI has shown promising growth potential over the past few years. It is providing conversational voice technology powered byartificial intelligence (AI)to several leading restaurant brands and car companies. After soaring last year to over $20, the stock has fallen 61% from those highs. But after the business just reported another quarter of strong growth, investors have to wonder if it's due for another rally. Revenue grew 151% year over year in the first quarter. This growth was partly boosted by the acquisition of Amelia last year, which will extend the company's technology to new markets like healthcare and financial services. In the quarter, SoundHound unveiled Amelia 7.0, which will allow customers to use voice-enabled AI agents to automatically complete tasks without further instructions. The company has been investing in voice technology for 20 years, and it has accumulated data from millions of conversations in dozens of languages. This is making its voice AI much smarter, potentially providing the company with a competitive advantage. Its relationship with leading AI chip supplierNvidiavalidates its capabilities. SoundHound's voice AI is integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise platform, which allows it to deliver faster processing and more responsive voice AI. It's making great progress to grow its customer base. No single customer makes up more than 10% of its total revenue, which removes customer-concentration risk from the business. However, SoundHound will still need to improve its profitability, as it reported a large adjusted net loss of $22 million on $29 million of revenue in the first quarter. The stock is also trading at an expensive valuation of 38times trailing sales. Overall, the company's growth, strategic acquisitions, and collaboration with Nvidia make it amid-cap stockworth considering. If you're looking for a fast-growing company with huge upside potential in the AI market,SoundHound AIis an intriguing option. If the company can narrow its losses and continue to report high revenue growth, the stock could be a long-term winner. Image source: Getty Images. In a year where there is a lot of uncertainty for the economy, marketers are looking for ways to boost the return on their ad spending, and many are increasingly turning to The Trade Desk, a leading digital ad-buying platform. After the stock was cut in half earlier this year over a rare revenue miss in the fourth quarter, The Trade Desk returned with a strong quarter of growth to start 2025. The stock jumped after it reported revenue grew 25% over the year-ago quarter. It also notched a significant improvement in profits, withearnings per sharesurging 67% year over year. The Trade Desk has been delivering high growth like this for several years. Its average annual revenue growth over the past 10 years is 49%, yet its platform has captured just 1% of total ad spending. Investors are counting on its Kokai platform to drive more growth. Kokai uses AI to scan millions of ad impressions instantly to help ad buyers improve the effectiveness and return on their advertising investment. Management previously said it expected all clients to be using the platform by the end of this year. Over the long term, The Trade Desk should benefit from people spending more time on platforms not owned by tech giants like Google, which controls a large portion of the digital ad market. Only around half of ad spending is going toward the open internet, while over half of Americans spend their time there. This is a big opportunity for The Trade Desk. Analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 31% in the coming years. The stock isn't cheap, trading at 41times expected earningsthis year. But investors interested in the The Trade Desk's opportunity should take advantage of the recent dip, because this is about as fair of a valuation investors can expect for this quality growth stock.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump's trade war truce with China still leaves a hefty 30% tariff in place, at least for the time being.On Monday, the White House announced that the U.S. and China had agreed to lower trade barriers with one another,simmering down a trade warthat had\u00a0exploded last month. The U.S. will pause the harshest tariffs for 90 days, while leaving a 10% \"baseline\" tariff in place, along with a 20% tariff that Trump said was to push China to crack down on fentanyl smuggling to the U.S. Tariffs of 25% remain on certain products including steel, aluminum, and automobiles. Although the trade deal announced Mondaywas a significant reductionand raised hopes that negotiations could further reduce import taxes, tariffs are still far higher than they were before Trump started raising them. The effective tariff rate on all U.S. imports after the tariff announcement is 15%, down from 24%, Abigail Watt, an economist with UBS, estimated in a commentary.Before Trump took office for the second time, the average tariff rate was 3%, according to an estimate by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Economists predict merchants will pass those import taxes on to consumers, meaning the tariffs could push up the cost of living and risk reigniting high inflation. Lowering the tariffs reduces those risks, economists said.\"The outcome of the U.S./China talks this weekend seem to take us back to pre-'Liberation Day' levels,\" Jim Reid, research strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a commentary. \"Increasingly, it\u2019s as if the last six weeks have been a bad dream and never actually happened.\"Dialing back the trade wars could help the economy on several fronts.\"This helps the economy in the short run,\" Jon Hilsenrath, senior advisor at StoneX, wrote in a commentary. \"Tariffs squeeze corporate profit margins, so reducing them will help boost profits and stock values.Households will see their 401(k) retirement plans improve, which could help consumption. It also reduces the risk of consumer price inflation and shortages on store shelves. It will relieve some anxiety at the Federal Reserve about inflation; it could help to hold down interest rates. That's all good news.\"",

The tariff news also boosted shares of toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), which had recently warned the initial duties would significantly impact profits. NRG Energy (NRG) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 as the nuclear power provider's first-quarter results easily exceeded estimates. Separately, the company purchased the natural gas generation and power plant platform from LS Power for about $12 billion, doubling its generation capacity. Next Technology Holding (NXTT) soared for a second straight session after the company revealed it added 5,000 bitcoin to its portfolio this year and plans to add more. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and rival gold miners tumbled along with the price of the precious metal on the tariff deal.

        "content": "Consumer stocks ranging from cruise operators to furniture retailers jumped Monday, lifted by U.S.-China trade developments. The S&P 500's consumer discretionary sector was recently up more than 5%, helped by news that the U.S. and China have walked back tariffs. Those gains, which easily outpaced those for the broader index, came as theWhite House announceda 90-day deescalation period in the trade war with China. (ReadInvestopedia'sfull coverage oftoday's trading here.) Some of the biggest gainers in the index included cruise operators Carnival (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH); athleticwear sellers Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Nike (NKE); and furniture and home goods company Williams-Sonoma (WSM). J.P. Morgan analysts in a Monday note examined how much companies would need to hike prices to maintain their gross profit while paying tariffs. Those that no longer need to consider steep price increases, which could deter customers, stand to benefit from the 90-day pause, analysts said. This includes toy companies, sporting goods stores and furniture and home good retailers. Some of the companies named by J.P. Morgan saw their stock soar on Monday, including furniture retailers Wayfair (W) and RH (RH), whose shares were recently up more than 21% and 17%, respectively; sports retailers Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO) and Dick's (DKS), whose shares gained about 15% and 9.5%, respectively; and toy company Mattel (MAT), whose stock rose about 9.6%. While working towards a longer-term agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30%, and China will cut its tax on U.S. imports to 10%, the Trump administration said early Monday.",

        "content": "Shares ofNvidia(NVDA5.41%)jumped again today to start this week's trading. The stock rose more than 5% before easing back Monday morning. That move kept the positive momentum going for the artificial intelligence (AI) leader. Shares were up 4.8% as of 12:09 p.m. ET. Shares have soared about 20% in just the past two weeks as they rebounded from a tariff-induced sell-off. The geopolitical picture remains somewhat cloudy, but Nvidia bulls are starting to see a clearer business picture beyond the uncertainty. Image source: Getty Images. The stock had been declining earlier this year as the global trade picture became more murky. The company has already taken a quantifiable financial hit from export restrictions on its H20specialty semiconductor chip. That chip was designed for sale in China, and new regulations forced the company to record a $5.5 billion charge for that inventory last month. Sales to China were more than $17 billion last year, representing about 13% of total revenue. So word of a productive meeting over the weekend between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterparts in Geneva haspainted a more-bullish picture. The stock is close to reaching the $3 trillionmarket cap thresholdtoday as a result. That makes sense since signs of more cooperation between the U.S. and China should be a net benefit for Nvidia's business. That business is thriving elsewhere, too. A boost to sales in China will only add to Nvidia's already growing profits. Investors should remember, however, that this weekend's news of a thawing trade war isn't yet a reality. A 90-day pause inreciprocal tariffsfrom both the U.S. and China is a good first step, though. In fact, it might just be the start of the next bull run for the shares. There could be more volatility ahead, but Nvidia looks to be a fine long-term holding as AI hardware and software permeates many business sectors in the coming months and years.",

        "content": "Investors and consumers have been climbing awall of worrylately. The imposition of tariffs and the trade war with China has sparked concerns about the potential to reignite inflation and pressure an already fragile economy. There has even been a growing chorus warning about the potential for a recession. However, some good news on the tariffs front broke Monday morning, fueling optimism about the future and driving a broad-based market rally. With that as a backdrop,artificial intelligence (AI)chipmakerNvidia(NVDA5.41%)and semiconductor giantBroadcom(AVGO6.30%)each jumped 4.5%, chipmakerAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD5.08%)rallied 5.3%, and chip foundryTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM5.73%), commonly referred to as TSMC, soared 6.2%, as of 12:07 p.m. ET on Monday. A check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- found no company-specific news to account for the run-up. This suggests that investors were focused on the positive developments related to tariffs. Image source: Getty Images. Word broke early Monday that the Trump administration had reached an agreement with China to bilaterally pause reciprocaltariffsover the next 90 days as a show of good faith while talks on a permanent accord continued. As a result, the U.S. temporarily lowered tariffs on Chinese goods to 30%, down from 145%. At the same time, China reduced tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%, from their previous rate of 125%. The announcement came after a weekend meeting in Geneva, the first face-to-face talks between the two superpowers since the tit-for-tat imposition of tariffs began in early April. Economists and retailers alike have been sounding the alarm that a prolonged trade war and increased tariffs could lead to supply chain disruptions and higher prices. Furthermore, consumer spending is the bedrock upon which the U.S. economy is built. If people begin spending less due to fears of an economic downturn, it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Retailers had begun ordering products for the holiday season in December. However, reports suggest that imports have already declined dramatically since early last month, leading to expectations of higher prices and shortages of some products from China and elsewhere. The adoption of AI has been running at full tilt for more than two years now, with advanced semiconductors providing the computational horsepower needed to fuel the AI revolution. As a result, many of the world's largest technology providers have beeninvesting heavilyin the chips and data centers at the heart of AI adoption, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars in spending this year alone. The rising tariffs have threatened to stop the AI revolution in its tracks by significantly increasing the price of semiconductors and supplementary products needed for the build-out. The pressure on semiconductor stocks has been dramatic, driving valuations down significantly in recent months. As a result, Broadcom and Nvidia are selling for 33 and 28 times forward earnings, while AMD and TSMC are even cheaper, with multiples of 27 and 20, respectively. The adoption of AI is expected to continue for years to come, giving astute investors the opportunity to buy stocks at the heart of the AI revolution at discounted prices.",

To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out ourpodcast center. When you're ready to invest, check outthis top 10 list of stocks to buy. A full transcript is below. This video was recorded on May 05, 2025 Ricky Mulvey:When you trade at 600 times trailing earnings, well, you got a high bar. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by Sanmeet Deo. Sanmeet, thanks for being here. Good to see you. Sanmeet Deo:Hey, good seeing you, Rick. Ricky Mulvey:We've got some earnings to breakdown. The biggest story today is Palantir and there are two stories with this company anytime you talk about it. One is the actual business the second is the stock because expectations for this company are absolutely incredible. Palantir, this is the company offering artificial intelligence platforms to the US federal government and private enterprises, some of its relationships with the federal government getting it into some controversial waters lately, not that CEO Alex Karp really minds that. The other is the results. Let's talk about the results. Total revenue up almost 40% year on year, majority of that growth coming from the United States, net income up 24%. That net income number, not sounding like a number of a company trading, it's 600 times trailing earnings, but all right. Here is where some investors and traders have noticed a little bit of pessimism, and that is international commercial revenue, which declined 5%. Sanmeet when you were breaking down the earnings here, what did you see in the actual business results? Sanmeet Deo:I actually liked it. I thought there was a ton of great growth here. One of the things I liked the most was that they just generated a bunch of cash flow. The cash flow operations were 310 million, representing a 35% margin, adjusted free cash flow was 370 million representing a 42% free cash flow margin, 42% free cash flow margin, let that sink in a bit. Ricky Mulvey:Alex Karp's commentary, noting, as you said, Palantir is on fire right now, the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence. But when we looked at international that's where Europe is going through, ''A very structural change and doesn't quite get AI. Maybe in the near future, we'll get AI.'' Let's talk about that European story. That's what investors are really responding to here. Do you think this is a hiccup, or is it a real problem for Palantir's growth story? Sanmeet Deo:Just for some context here, 72% of Palantir's business is in the United States with about 10% in the UK and the rest of it being in the rest of the world. Europe is not a huge portion of their business now. It could be a big opportunity for them for sure. While it's concerning, I'm not too concerned about it right now. I've also heard those rumblings of Europe not getting AI. I may offend some people here, but Europe doesn't strike me as always being on the innovative side of technology. They've been a little bit behind and so it could improve. They might jump on quickly, but when you think of AI, you think of the United States and China. Ricky Mulvey:As an ASML shareholder, count me offended Sanmeet. Let's talk about valuation to the extent we can. Before earnings, this was a company trading at 600 times trailing earnings ish. Tough to tell when there's so much movement in the stock. But at the time I wrote this Palantir valuation was about 560 times trailing earnings. Even though it's getting knocked down by the market, there is still a lot of growth priced into this company. Sanmeet, this is a software company that trades at more than 90 times sales. On that basis, it's the most expensive company in the NASDAQ with one exception, and that is now it's just called Strategy Inc. It's the artist formerly known asMicroStrategy, and now that's more of aBitcoinholding company. Tough to make the comp there. Basically, the market is saying that Palantir does not have a lot of competition. It has a really strong moot for its artificial intelligence platform, and maybe just maybe this is the next coming ofNVIDIA. This is the software version of NVIDIA, and it is going to places that are just unfathomable to any value investor. This is one I've struggled with. it's been on my watch list, but those numbers that's a nosebleed valuation. Are you buying the story that the market is selling here? Sanmeet Deo:This is by no means a value investor, darling that's for sure. Over the next years, the market is expecting revenue growth of 31% plus and EPS growth north of 70%. That's very, very lofty indeed, very high expectations. One of the reasons the stock is down today is actually down much more than even when they opened, but how do you meet those expectations? What is enough when they report? Their numbers, if you look at them, forget the stock price, forget the valuation, just the fundamentals are strong, 71% US commercial revenue growth. That's huge and they're gaining more commercial customers they're gaining more prominence in that area. There's a lot of people that believe Palantir's just a government contractor type software company, but they're expanding and they're expanding fast, as you can see. Difficult to purchase these valuations for anyone that does not have the stomach to bear, what will eventually be a correction in its price. We were talking aboutCloudflareonce and they had hit, I think it was 100 times sales or something and they flamed out. The thing I see with Palantir versus some other very, very lofty valuations that this has the potential to be a company that will be a standard when it comes to AI, almost like an AI operating system of sorts for companies. Anecdotal evidence I've seen tells me that when people get into this software, they're keeping it and they're keeping it for a long time and they're using and they're gaining a lot of value from it. While it's tough with the valuation, that's really the only thing that holds me back from buying more of this thing. Ricky Mulvey:If you look at the call, there's customer examples. I think it wasWalgreensciting basically hundreds of billions of human decisions that are now going to Palantir's artificial intelligence platform that there's going to be a large scale commercialization of this but man, there's got to be a lot of it for this valuation to make sense. Let's move on to Celsius. This is one we enjoy talking about. I'm a shareholder, I know you're a shareholder. But this is one that I'm starting to put on a shorter leash, Sanmeet. International sales up more than 40% but this former growth darling is posting overall sales declines, sales declines in North America. That's its biggest market, earnings per share, almost cut in half from the prior year. I remember what was it six months a year ago, we were talking about inventory issues with PepsiCo coming in as a distributor. It's been a while, man. They've been in that relationship for a while. I don't know if we can keep blaming that. What is happening here with Celsius? Sanmeet Deo:A lot of discounting. They're having to use promos to sell. ThePepsiissue is still an issue. Why it hasn't been resolved, why it's not Pepsi overstocking, what's going on with that? Didn't really say too much even more on the quarter. In terms of earnings, they had SG&A costs so were up about 21% while their revenues were down 7% for the quarter. That's not the kind of math that you want for strong earnings growth. I was pretty disappointed by this quarter as well. I'm a huge fan of the company and the drink too, actually. But they did point some tailwinds coming up when it comes to resets and their stocking shelf resets, some new products, Alani Nu coming on the summer season and this is starting to be more easy comps going forward. They've cited that tailwinds are coming, and let's see in the next couple of quarters if they're true to their word. Ricky Mulvey:Maybe this goes against the health promise that it offers, but it needs a mixed drink. You've got the Red Bull Vodka. I think you need a Celsius cocktail for the summer to get these sales going. But when you were digging through the business results, there's a lot of reasons to be pessimistic. You can tell me all you want that you're driving category share growth, but if you're losing money, that doesn't make me happy as an investor in your company. Any green shoots or anything stand out here that you think is worth talking about. Sanmeet Deo:Look, if you think about Alani Nu acquisition was a good acquisition in terms of owning now another brand in the portfolio, whether it's masking the weakness in Celsius core brand is another thing. But combined, they have a 16.2% dollar share in the energy drink market. They're still the number three company in that market. While some of the revenue growth has been weak, some of the sales and earnings have been weak, they're not going anywhere anytime soon. That gives me some comfort. I think over time, they are looking to build out and broaden out a portfolio of brands. I'd be interested to see how they do that as well. International is growing fast and growing well and I think that could continue to form. Ricky Mulvey:The optimistic side of the Alani Nu acquisition, which Alani Nu is a female focused energy drink that they purchased last quarter. The positive spin is that this makes sense for their category. It's a healthy ish energy drink that fits well within their portfolio of brands. The more pessimistic take is that here is a company struggling to find growth within its core product, and now it is maybe overpaying for growth by acquiring another brand in order to become a growth story again. They've had a few months to settle out this Alani Nu acquisition. What needs to happen for this to be a good idea, a good buy for Celsius? Sanmeet Deo:Alani Nu they report retail sales growing about 88% so I'd like to see them continue to grow. Maybe it's because of this acquisition, I've been noticing Alani Nu a lot more in my social feeds and ads and whatnot, but it is a very, very popular brand, and I think the buying the company really stemmed the serious threat that they posed to Celsius so I'd like to see more like synergies where it comes to will Alani Nu's growth be able to help bring that Celsius core brand growth up. Because while there is overlap with the demographics, there is still some differences, and it could broaden out the distribution and the channel synergies. I'd like to see some of that happening and the share growth to continue. Ricky Mulvey:As we wrap up on this Celsius topic, if you have an open line of communication to CEO John Fieldly, he's still telling investors a growth story, but the results are showing, maybe this is more of a mature company. Do you think it's time for Celsius maybe to settle down into a more mature place. Start telling investors a cash cow story, start paying a dividend. We're going to focus on buybacks if we think our stock is undervalued. Should it really be settling into life as a mature company or is it still got a growth story left in it? Sanmeet Deo:I think it's a little early to call itself a cash cow story at this point. They definitely probably don't want to do that right after buying a very high growth brand in Alani Nu. They're working really hard to turn around their Celsius core brand and get that going again. While it could help in the short term, I think they still have a lot more growth ahead of it in terms of that platform that they're developing and continue to pursue that. Ricky Mulvey:We'll wrap up with DoorDash, which also reported swinging to a net income profit, but investors are responding to two acquisitions. We'll look at those in a sec. Right now, the business of DoorDash looking pretty strong orders and revenues up about 20% each. When I look at this company, Sanmeet, something that's interesting is this could very easily have become a fallen angel from COVID yet it's still continuing to see orders, revenue and profit rise. What's happening at DoorDash? Sanmeet Deo:It's a great point because DoorDash was heavily used during COVID, but the habit is stuck. there's many of those fallen angels where the habit didn't stick, and I think ofPelotonas the primary culprit there. But the convenience and reliability of DoorDash has stuck, and more and more people are using it. teenagers are using. I have to stop my kids from getting on my phone and ordering cookies from DoorDash it's become a staple of our lives now. Ricky Mulvey:The things that investors are responding to are these acquisitions. There's been two of them, totaling about $5 billion. You have Deliveroo, which is a delivery service in Europe and the Middle East. They purchased or looking to purchase that for about $4 billion. Then a restaurant tech restaurant reservation service called SevenRooms for 1.2 billion. That one makes a little bit less sense. But what do you think of these acquisitions? The investment community seems to think you've posted good results, you're swinging to a profit, you're building sales, but maybe you're bringing in some diversification with these companies. Sanmeet Deo:With Deliveroo, they're expanding into their geographic reach, getting nine new markets in UK, Europe, Middle East, Singapore. I think they're really trying to take on Uber Eats and Just Takeaway. Look, there were more before, but there's so many delivery apps, and I think it's going to fall out to having a few and those few are going to be the ones that have scale. Those are the ones that have that customer stickiness that habit that's formed by using them. Just from my own personal experience, I now tend to go to DoorDash more than I go to other apps or Uber Eats. I don't go to some of the older ones or the other ones, one because they're gone and two because just don't see them as a place to go. I think they're really taking an aggressive push to scale and compete hard with the likes of Uber Eats and others and gaining that local expertise and becoming a multi category with delivering not just food, but groceries and other things. The SevenRooms acquisition, though, yeah, that makes a little less sense to me. Some of the reason behind that is, well, now we can help restaurants with not just delivery, but managing on premise and enhancing their commerce platform, supporting their restaurant operations. Sounds a little bit more like what Toast is doing. I don't know if they want to get into that. I can see how there's some client or segments that they can get into with SevenRooms, but do they really need to make a 1.2 billion dollar acquisition to do that? I think that one is a little less reasonable and I don't think that was necessary, per se, but we'll see how it goes. Ricky Mulvey:We'll leave it there. Sanmeet Deo, appreciate your time and insight. Thanks for joining us on Motley Fool Money. Sanmeet Deo:Thanks, Ricky. Ricky Mulvey:Up next, we're taking a look at scams. Cynthia Stewart is the executive director and founder of DART, a nonprofit that uses gamification to help people recognize online scammers. She joined Robert Brokamp to discuss which scams are on the rise and how to protect yourself and loved ones from losing money. Robert Brokamp:What people think of victims of scams, I think they often think of an older person who falls for something like a fake email or a text. Is it generally the case that senior citizens are more likely to fall prey to scams? Cynthia Stewart:Actually, no. The latest research shows that younger generations, taken as a group are more vulnerable to scams. Millennials and Gen Z are the highest rates of victimization. Older adults lose more money to scams than any other generation because they are more targeted and they have more to lose. Scammers are disproportionately targeting them because they have greater potential to get larger amounts of money from them, but they are not, in fact, more vulnerable than anyone else. That's a myth I like to debunk. Robert Brokamp:Let's talk about some of the biggest scams. What would you say are maybe three or so of the most common that you see? Cynthia Stewart:Well, the FBI just put out this year's Internet crime report. If you go by number of dollars lost, investment scams and a lot of that is fake cryptocurrency investments, tech support scams and romance scams would be your top three. If you go by number of victims, fishing is always number one and then tech support and then extortion. Those investment scams, I find particularly alarming because crypto ATMs are going in all over the world. I went and looked and there are 12 within walking distance of my house, which just makes it easier for people to fall for those scams. I think crypto is the new gift cards. People have learned not to buy gift cards, but now they can just send them to the crypto ATM and their money is just as gone and just as hard to recover. Robert Brokamp:I think one aspect of these scams is there's often a certain amount of emotion involved and a certain amount of urgency. It either makes you feel very good because someone's reaching out to you and saying, Oh, you're so handsome, we should be friends, or someone saying, I'm your granddaughter and if I don't get some money soon, I'm going to lose my house. You either feel very good or very bad or very scared and there's urgency to it. You need to act very quickly to prevent or get something. Cynthia Stewart:Yes, those are two of the hallmarks, especially the emotion part. That is really the scammers trick. They get you not to think, people will all the time tell me, I'm too smart to be scammed, I know what to do, and they're not wrong. They probably do know what to do but then I've heard hundreds of stories that end with, and then I hung up the phone and then I thought. They get you into feelings so that you don't think. Yes, it's either anytime anybody is trying to make you feel a strong emotion, that's the time to step back take some time and think about it. If it's a real problem and money can fix it, you have time to check it out. Don't let anybody rush you by making you feel some sort of way. Robert Brokamp:I think a lot of people think, well, I would never fall prey to something from a stranger. But these days, people can impersonate people who are not strangers very quickly, often using AI to impersonate voices or just gathering information about you from social media, Facebook, TikTok, provide some information and they're like OK this really is my granddaughter or this really is my bank because they know so much about me. Cynthia Stewart:It only takes 3 seconds of audio to produce a pretty good copy of a person's voice and make them say anything you want. It can sound exactly like your favorite grandchild it only takes small video clips now and completely publicly available software you can make really realistic looking video calls now. It is getting to the point where not only is hearing not believing, seeing you just have to check everything out. One thing I am constantly advising people to do, and I will advise your listeners if you take one thing from this, talk to your friends and family, use this podcast as your reason why. We need a plan. The next time there's some a disaster or one of us is in trouble and we need help, how are we going to confirm that we are talking to the person we think we're talking to? If you have a plan, a code word or some way you're going to acknowledge each other. That stops scammers from being able to rip you off, it means if you know if somebody's putting pressure on you, that it's not the person you think it is because you already have the plan in place. If it really was your grandchild, they'd know what to say. Robert Brokamp:In our family, our kids knew to use terms related to Star Wars as the code words. That's one very concrete step. What are some other concrete things people can do to protect themselves? Cynthia Stewart:I think talking about it is a huge thing, especially talk about it with the older adults in your life. They are particularly targeted. They're also particularly prone to being embarrassed if they fall victim to a scam or to feel like somehow they've done something wrong, if they're even targeted. They're not. Scammers target everybody technology allows them to target thousands of people at a time. But the embarrassment keeps them from talking about it. Fear that if they admit that they fell for something, they're going to lose their independence will keep them from talking about it, and isolation makes them more vulnerable. Let them know, Hey, I almost fell for this scam the other day. Hey, have you seen that tollbooth thing that's going around? Talk about it secrecy helps the scammers. Robert Brokamp:When you're talking about older folks, many of us have grandparents parents getting up there in years. They may be struggling with some cognitive decline or something like that. How do we help them stay on top of this? I say this because we all have stories of things that have happened to people we know. My father in law was basically participating in a fake lottery until my wife figured it out, cut off the source of funds and they actually sent a taxi to his house to try to get more money. It's pretty scary. Cynthia Stewart:Those are the ones that frighten me when people like they know where you live. The level of maliciousness is just out of this world. There are tools that can help flag potential scam calls that can filter those out. Older adults may need help installing those sorts of things on their devices. Maybe offering to put those in, it's a delicate balance because you don't want to be condescending or take away their independence. On the other hand, you're trying to keep them safe. Open communication, I think is really the biggest tool. Making use of those tools, but letting them know what you're doing and why you're doing it so they know what that means if it comes, suspected spam pops up or just talking about the techniques. What spoofing is, the fact that the caller ID is a number you recognize doesn't mean that it's the person it says. Then there's also a delicate balance of not scaring people so much that they then won't answer their phone at all. We run into that as well. People need to know what they can do safely, it is always safe to look at your email. It is always safe to look at your text messages that doesn't mean opening attachments. Where is the level where it becomes dangerous? Lots of important conversations to have with folks. Robert Brokamp:What are some of the things you should do once you realize you or someone you know has actually already fallen for a scam? Cynthia Stewart:Change your passwords right away. I recommend just change your passwords even if you think you didn't give that up because you're never sure how much they got that you don't realize you've given up and report it. Report it to the FBI or the FTC. That's the Federal Trade Commission. They may not be able to get your money back. In fact, it's very probable they can't but what they are looking at scammers are very organized now. It is international organized crime, and if they can see the patterns, if they got you to pay in crypto and you have the number of the crypto wallet you sent it to, if they can see, oh, hey, this is showing up again and again and again, then they can build the case to put federal resources toward closing a ring down or working with international partners. Even if you don't think it will benefit you, it's still worth reporting.

        "content": "Global pharmaceutical shares jumped in intraday trading Monday, reversing their pre-market declines, as investors anticipated\u00a0the legal challenges that may result from attempts to carry out President Donald Trump'sexecutive orderon drug prices. Trump signed an executive order Monday directing government health insurance agencies to buy medicines at the lower prices that drugmakers charge outside the U.S., potentially cutting drug costs, he said, by 59% to 90%. The order stipulates thatMedicare, the government's health insurance program for the elderly, and Medicaid, the program for people with lower incomes, will offer to pay pharmaceutical companies the lowest prices charged in other developed countries. The executive order came a day after Trump posted on his Truth Social platform about a plan to reduce the prices of prescription drugs, sending shares of global pharmaceutical stockstumblingearly Monday. Following the release of the executive order, however, drug makers Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE), AbbVie (ABBV),\u00a0Merck (MRK), and Novo Nordisk (NVO) all were up by Monday afternoon, trading between 3% and 6%. Citi analysts on Monday said that details of the government's plans to bring down drug prices are \"still vague\" but the \"language in the EO has less focus on PBMs than expected, and we think challenging enforcement and likely headwinds in court is leading a rebound in the space.\" PBMs, or pharmacy benefit managers, are companies that administer drug benefits for health insurers and work with insurers, drug makers, and pharmacies. U.S. drug prices are nearly three times higher than those charged in other developed countries, according to U.S. government data. Branded drugs are more than three times higher, even with rebates included.",

As soon as the news hit, the Nasdaq spiked over 4%, pushing it back into bull-market territory up more than 20% from its early April lows. Amazon jumped about 7.4% on hopes that lower duties will trim import costs and keep ad revenues flowing.

        "content": "Most financial advisors recommend diversifying your retirement portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. But some argue that going all-in on stocks could vastly increase your retirement wealth. Putting 100% of your retirement portfolio into stocks is a big decision that depends on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon. The key is understanding whether you're one of those who could benefit from this approach, which significantly changes the level of risk you'll face. Is an all-stock retirement plan worth the risk, or should you aim for a more balanced approach? Let\u2019s dive into the pros, cons, and expert insights to help you decide what\u2019s right for you. Noah Damsky, founder of the Los Angeles-based Marina Wealth Advisors, acknowledges that investing your whole portfolio in stocks \u201cmight not be the best idea for everyone.\u201d But many people are good candidates for an all-stock portfolio, he said. \"A balanced portfolio can be great, but including a good chunk of your portfolio in fixed income leaves a lot of growth on the table,\" he said, particularly for people who may live in retirement for over 20 years. \"If your spending is low enough relative to your overall wealth that you run a very small risk of depleting your assets, a larger or full allocation to stocks can make a lot of sense. In that case, you might be more worried about what you'll ultimately leave to your heirs.\" Put simply, this strategy could work if you have plenty of money saved and don't need to spend much of it. For example, if you've saved several million dollars, have your house paid off, and live comfortably on Social Security, you might be a good candidate. \"Their day-to-day needs are more than sufficiently covered bySocial Security incomeplus a large asset base, so their primary concern is legacy planning\u2014or how they want to leave an inheritance to the next generation,\" Damsky said. A team of researchers led by Aizhan Anarkulova, a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School, found that an all-equity retirement plan generated 50% more retirement wealth, on average, than a60/40 portfolioof 60% domestic stocks and 40% bonds. The portfolio they studied, however, wasn't without diversification\u2014they spread the stocks among domestic and foreign companies. Still, the researchers noted that all-stock portfolios are vulnerable to large drawdowns, which \"can inflict intense psychological pain\" on investors and cause some to \"abandon their investments rather than stay the course.\" \"Our results, as a whole, do not suggest that the all-equity strategy is safe; they merely suggest that it is safer than common alternatives,\" the researchers concluded. \"Given the relative safety and strong growth potential of equities, retirement savers and retirees would likely benefit from adopting a 'set it and forget it' strategy that fully invests in domestic and international stocks.\" When investing in an all-stock portfolio, you have to be comfortable, both financially and emotionally, with volatility. Damsky said he asks clients, \"If we have another2008 crisis, where markets plunge 20% quickly, or even 50%, what will your situation look like? How will your lifestyle be affected?\u201d This prepares them for therisksinvolved. A caveat of the above is what the Emory University study notes upfront: the results can change drastically depending on the period looked at. Keeping a mix of different investments might still make good financial sense for most Americans. \"In retirement, one of the things you really need from a financial planning perspective is predictability,\" Ian Bloom, an advisor and founder of Raleigh, North Carolina-basedOpen World Financial Life Planning, told Investopedia. \u201cDiversification into bonds, commodities, and real estate investments tends to provide slightly lower volatility overall\u2014and that often translates to a [greater] sense of security.\u201d Bloom also says he ensures these clients have about two years of cash reserves, so they aren\u2019t too worried about short-term market volatility.With this cushion, retirees can avoid selling investments at \"dramatic\" losses if there's a market crash. After all, theaverage recovery periodfor major U.S. market crashes is about two years. Bloom suggests alternatives like commodities funds or real estate investment trusts (REITs) for retirees who still want higher returns but are nervous about an all-stock portfolio. \"That might be a middle ground that's more palatable for a retiree who's trying to invest exclusively in stocks,\" he said. While a 100% stock retirement portfolio offers the potential for higher returns, it's essential to assess your financial situation, risk tolerance, and spending habits. Some experts suggest that retirees with a lot of assets and fewer expenses might benefit from a higher stock allocation. However, this approach also carries the risk of significant short-term losses during market downturns.",

We cover refinancing every business day, including thenational average refi ratefor all major loan types, as well asstate-by-state refi averages. The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Mortgage rates have not been spared from the market chaos triggered by President Trump's evolvingtariffpolicy. The administration's April 2 tariff announcement triggered an immediate stock market sell-off, which led to a quick drop in 10-year Treasury yields that pushed mortgage rates lower. But that trend reversed after only two days. Bond yields then soared\u2014confounding many experts\u2014and that shot mortgage rates higher until they reached a 2025 peak on April 11. But 30-year mortgage rates changed direction again three weeks ago\u2014and this last week, they held on to most of the decline. Below, you can see the change in rates from last Friday vs. April 11 for each new purchase loan average. We then dive deeper into 30-year, 15-year, and jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loans. Rates on 30-year new purchase loans have given up 16 basis points over the last four calendar weeks. That lowers the flagship average to 6.98%\u2014a notable improvement vs. the 7.14% average registered on April 11. Leading up to that reading, 30-year rates surged a remarkable 44 basis points, for their biggest Friday-to-Friday gain since June 2022 and their most expensive average in almost 11 months. Things were much better in September, when the 30-year average plunged to a two-year low of 5.89% (the cheapest Friday average being 6.03%). So far this year, the lowest weekly reading has been 6.55%. Every business day, we publishnational rate averages for various loan types, and alsoeach state's 30-year rate average. Right now, New York, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee have the lowest 30-year rates. Rates on 15-year new purchase loanshave declined even more in the past four weeks, subtracting a bold 28 basis points to average 6.03% on Friday.Still, the current reading is more than a percentage point above the two-year low of 4.97% registered in September. Rates on jumbo 30-year new purchase loans fell 19 basis points across four weeks, landing Friday at a 6.96% average. That's compared to a 2025 high of 7.15%. In contrast, September rates on new 30-year jumbo loans sank as far as 6.24%, with the lowest weekly average registering at 6.39%.

        "content": "What's truly remarkable aboutWarren Buffettis his longevity. From 1965 to 2024, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) returned an incredible compound return of 19.9% per year, nearly double the returns of theS&P 500 Indexat 10.4%.While markets have risen and fallen and countless investment fads have come and gone, Buffett's success hasn't\u2014even in 2025, his Berkshire company posted more than 16% total return between Jan. 1 and May 1, while the S&P 500 lost 4.3% in total returns, according to TradingView data. Below, we'll explore five key habits that have fueled Buffett's extraordinary staying power in the investing world\u2014habits that any investor can adopt to improve their own financial journey. \"We select our marketable equity securities in much the same way we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety,\" Buffett wrote Berkshire shareholders back in the late 1970s. \"We want the business to be (1) one that we can understand, (2) with favorable long-term prospects, (3) operated by honest and competent people, and (4) available at a very attractive price.\"Let's take these in turn, with one more that pulls them all together. A fundamental Buffett principle is his commitment to staying within what he calls his \"circle of competence.\"Instead of chasing every trending investment opportunity, Buffett says you should stick to what you know best. This approach explains why Buffett avoided technology stocks for companies he didn't understand during thedot-com boomof the late 1990s. While this decision initially drew criticism as tech stocks soared, it protected Berkshire Hathaway from significant losses when the bubble eventually burst. Showing how patience pays, Buffett's net worth accelerated after he turned 50. At age 48, he was worth $100 million; in 2025, he's worth about $166 billion, 1,660 times as much. \"Our favorite holding period is forever,\" Buffett has said, highlighting his avoidance of short-term thinking as an investor.Rather than chasingquarterly earnings reportsor attempting to time market fluctuations, Buffett focuses on the fundamental value of businesses over decades. For individual investors, this means resisting the urge to constantly check stock prices or make frequent trades based on short-term news. Instead, focus on buying quality businesses at reasonable prices and give them time to grow. The third principle Buffett follows is investing in companies run by honest and competent people. \"It is a real pleasure to work with managers who...instinctively and unerringly think like owners,\" Buffett said to Berkshire shareholders. How can individual investors assess management quality? Look for consistent messaging inannual reportsand conference calls, reasonable executive compensation relative to performance, significant insider ownership, and a track record of fulfilling promises made to shareholders. Red flags include frequent accounting restatements, excessive executive perks, and complex corporate structures that obscure financial results. Companies with these problems don't often last long. No matter how excellent a business might be, Buffett refuses to overpay, understanding that the price determines the return on investment. Buffett\u00a0follows his mentorBenjamin Graham's school of value investing, which tells you to look for securities with prices that are low based on their fundamentals. This tells younotto follow the crowd. The fifth principle that combinesBuffett's investment philosophyinvolves his extraordinary patience. \"Our stay-put behavior reflects our view that the stock market serves as a relocation center at which money is moved from the active to the patient,\" Buffett once said, highlighting the importance of long-term thinking in investment success. Buffett's remarkable longevity comes from five foundational habits: investing in what he understands, focusing on long-term value, seeking out the best management, practicingvalue investing, and committing to lifelong patience.",

This has created internal tensions between business leaders eager to finalize the deal and national security officials concerned about potential misuse of the technology, especially given G42's partnerships with companies like OpenAI and its connections to Chinese firms. The administration's approach contrasts with the Biden administration's rejection of similar sales due to fears of empowering autocratic governments with close ties to China, and it is also expected to announce a deal with Saudi Arabia for access to AI chips from companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.",

        "content": "Christmas arrived early this year on Wall Street. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said the U.S. and Chinaagreed to slash tariffson each other\u2019s imports for 90 days while officials hammer out a comprehensive trade deal. The U.S. willlower duties on Chinese goods to 30%from 145%, while China will cut tariffs on U.S. imports to 10% from 125%. The tariff reprieve exceeded the expectations of many on Wall Street. \u201cNo one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,\u201d Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said. They may not have even been on President Donald Trump\u2019s; \u201c80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B.,\u201d the president said on Friday, referring to Bessent. Stocks werebuoyant on Monday, with the S&P 500 rallying more than 3% to recoup all of itspost-\u201cLiberation Day\u201d losses. Wedbush Securities analysts led by Dan Ives called Monday\u2019s announcement \u201ca dream scenario\u201d that put the possibility of stocks hitting new highs this year back on the table. They concede that some damage has been done to supply chains and the economy since Trump announced sweeping\u201creciprocal\u201d tariffson April 2, but they expect \u201cthe Street will instead focus on normalized growth\u201d now that recession risks are dramatically lower. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, interpreted Monday\u2019s announcement as a sign that \u201cthe Trump administration was usingtariffsas a negotiating tactic after all, and we aren\u2019t going to go blindly back to theSmoot-Hawleydays.\u201d The Trump administration hasoffered several justificationsfor tariffs. Officials have argued they will force trading partners into negotiations, raise federal revenue, and bolster American manufacturing, objectives that experts note are at odds with each other in many ways. Wall Street has been hoping tariffs will be short-lived negotiating tactics rather than permanent fixtures of U.S. trade policy. The agreement with China also gives investors hope that the White House can find common ground with even its most hostile trading partners. \"Of all of our trading partners, China is the most difficult \u2013 and potentially important \u2013 for the US to deal with and by tackling (and by appearances, beginning to solve) the most difficult problem, the market is going to take great comfort in the idea that there is a way forward,\" Zaccarelli said. Wall Street's attention now turns to early July, when Trump\u2019s90-day pauseon most \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs is set to expire. \u201cExpect volatility [as] we approach the 90-day reciprocal tariffs deadline,\u201d said Gina Bolvin,president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group. The White House says it is in the process of negotiating deals with dozens of countries, but experts note such deals oftentake far longer than 90 daysto deliver. To that point, the U.S. and the U.K.\u2014two close allies with relatively balanced trade\u2014announced a frameworkfor a trade deal last week, more than a month after \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d \u201cThis is de-escalation, not a trade deal. More work remains to be done. A pause isn\u2019t permanent,\u201d LPL's Buchbinder said. And an agreement with China, experts warn, will be among the most difficult to reach, considering the magnitude oftrade between the two countriesand their long history of distrust. \u201cThe Chinese are quite adept at stalling, so there's still a very steep hill to climb to get a real agreement,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group.\u00a0Nonetheless, even a temporary reduction is a massive relief to corporate America. \u201cThis pause gives US companies more time to adapt and to plan for contingencies should the trade talks go sideways again,\u201d Cox said. Wall Streetwas jubilant Monday, but tariff headwinds remain. Experts warn a 30% tariff rate on China is still high enough to reduce trade and raise prices. Plus, all U.S. imports are still subject to a baseline 10% tariff that, judging from last week\u2019s U.K. deal and Monday\u2019s announcement, some experts say islikely here to stay. Monday's pause lowered the effective U.S. tariff rateto 15% from 24%, according to UBS economist Abigail Watts. That's an improvement, but 15% is still five times the rate when Trump took office. There are also lots of deals left to negotiate and not a lot of time to do so. \u201cRisk remains that tariffs go back up from current levels as the pauses end,\u201d Buchbinder said. He also noted that, with aprice-to-earnings ratioof about 21 times, \u201call the good news is priced in\u201d to U.S. stocks.",

U.S. officials on Monday said they wouldlower tariffs on Chinese goodsto 30% from 145%, while China said it would slash U.S. tariffs to 10% from 125%. The deal leaves in place tariffs President Donald Trump imposed in February as punishment for China\u2019s alleged role in America\u2019s fentanyl crisis, along with levies on steel, aluminum, andcars. The S&P 500 on Monday was on track to close comfortably above its pre-\u201cLiberation Day\u201d level. The effective U.S. tariff rate, however, remainswell abovewhere it was just six weeks ago, leading some to wonder whether the tariff relief rally of the last month is sustainable. \u201cStocks have staged an impressive recovery since the April 8 closing low,\u201d wrote Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, in a research note on Monday. (April 9 was the day President Trumppaused for 90 daysthe \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that prompted one of thesharpest sell-offsin recent memory.) However, Turnquist estimates that this rally\u2019s biggest test will be whether the S&P 500 can overtake its 200-day moving average at about 5,750. \u201cA breakout above this area of overhead resistance would not only raise the probability of a sustained recovery, but also potentially open the door for institutional demand entering the market via renewed interest fromtrend-following funds,\u201d said Turnquist. TheS&P 500was up more than 3% in recent trading on Monday at 5,835. In its most bullish scenario, LPL Financial expects the S&P 500 to finish the year between 6,100 and 6,200, which would represent a full-year return of between 3.7% and 5.4%. But history tells us there could be morepullbacksalong the way, according to Turnquist. Over the past 75 years, any time the S&P 500 has retreated more than 15% from a record high, it has experienced an additional pullback of between 18% and 19%, on average, within the following 12 months. The S&P 500 closed more than 15% below its record high on April 4, and since that day, the index has experienced a maximum drawdown of 5.5%. If that remains its biggest pullback over the next year, it would be the shallowest maximum drawdown on record.",

Last month, the retailer maintained its guidance of 3% to 4% sales growth for the first quarter, but cautioned its \"range of outcomes\" for operating income growth had widened amidtariff uncertainty. However,analysts at Morgan Stanleyrecently pointed out the retailer sits well positioned to manage import duties given its scale,supply chainadvantages, and category mix. Walmart shares closed little changed at around $97 on Monday, even as thebroader market ralliedfollowing news that the U.S. and China had agreed tosuspend for 90 days the huge tariffsthat the countries had imposed on one another. The stock has gained 7% since the start of the year, outpacing the performance of major stock indexes, and have jumped 60% over the past 12 months, boosted in part by the retailer\u2019s ability to attract higher income customers and grow itse-commercebusiness. Below, we take a closer look at Walmart\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify major price levels worth watching out for. Since abear trapbelow the200-day moving averageemerged on Walmart\u2019s chart last month, the shares have staged a sharp turnaround. More recently, the stock has consolidated on decliningtrading volumeahead of the retailer\u2019s quarterly results this week, indicating that larger market participants, such asinstitutional investors, remain on the sidelines leading into the report. However, therelative strength indexremains above neutral territory, signaling bullish price momentum. Let\u2019s, point out several majorsupport and resistancelevels that investors will likely be watching. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially track the $90 level. This area may provide support near ahorizontal linethat connects the early-April peak with the lower range ofsideways driftthat formed on the chart between late December and mid-January. Thebulls\u2019 failure to successfully defend this major technical level could see the shares drop to around $85. Investors may place buylimit ordersin this location near a range ofconsolidationnear the March trough that preceded the last month\u2019s bear trap low. Bullishprice actionahead of the retailer\u2019s quarterly results would likely bring thepsychological$100 level into play. The shares may face selling pressure in this area near the upper levels of last week\u2019s sideways trading activity, which also closely aligns with the high of the late-Februarystock gap. Finally, a stronger move higher could see Walmart shares climb to around $105. This region on the chart would likely attract significant attention from investors near the stock\u2019srecord highset in mid-February.
