An appeals court offered Trump a temporary reprieve from the ruling but the saga could delay negotiations with other trading partners that began after Trump announced a 90-day pause on the steep \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that were rolled out in early April. If left intact, the US would impose a 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te has sought to downplay any tensions while highlighting the strength of relations with the US. He expressed willingness to increase imports from the US, including energy, agricultural and military goods, to lower the trade imbalance. Premier Cho Jung-tai has said preparations for a second round of talks were underway. Chen said he remains confident that his government will reach a deal before the US pause is set to lift and will push for Washington to drop Taiwan\u2019s tariffs \u201cas low as possible.\u201d He added that as a strong American ally, Taiwan should push for lower rates than those on others. \u201cWe want to be the special someone,\u201d Chen said, adding that if other countries finalize the tariff at 10%, \u201cbeing special means lower than 10%.\u201d Open The Market Chen indicated Taiwan had some room to lower tariffs on some US goods such as automobiles, which are subject to a 17.5% levy. \u201cI hope, as a consumer and a fan of the American car, we can have a lower tariff on US cars,\u201d he said. He said the auto sector isn\u2019t a strategic one for Taiwan and shouldn\u2019t hinder talks with Washington. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic about the negotiation between the US and Taiwan, especially when it comes to autos.\u201d Chen also said Taiwan would open its market to more US agricultural products. In addition to beef and pork, the government is reviewing a potential list of other goods, he said. Before the Trump administration announced the levies, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the archipelago\u2019s biggest firm and a key supplier to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., said that it would invest an additional $100 billion in the US. However, Chen said potential US tariffs on chip imports could complicate Taiwanese investments. Such levies would affect companies\u2019 cash flows, he said, hurting their ability to invest. Chen said plans for a sovereign wealth fund announced by Lai last week provided an opportunity for the self-ruled democracy to invest globally, \u201cespecially with our close friend and our close trading partners, the US included.\u201d --With assistance from Joanne Wong, Nikita Koirala and Lauren Faith Lau.

CEO Kelly Ortberg said that the country\u2019s airlines had indicated they would begin taking first deliveries in June, with the development coming after China earlier this monthreportedly reversed a ruling barring its airlines from taking deliveries of Boeing planes. Sentiment likely received an added boost after Ortberg said Boeing plans to increase production of its top selling 737 Max jets to 42 per month in the near-term and 47 per month by the end of the year. Boeing shares have rebounded 62% from their early-April low and trade 18% higher since the start of the year through Thursday\u2019s close, lifted by growing optimism thatthe jet maker could become a beneficiary of a broader U.S-China trade deal.

        "content": "For years, theS&P 500has been the most important benchmark for mainstream U.S. investing. But in a move that is turning heads on Wall Street and beyond, the index now includes Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) as its first crypto-native member. If you invest in an S&P 500 index fund, you now have a stake in theworld of digital assets, whether you planned to or not. Our analysis below helps you understand what this means for your portfolio. Cryptocurrenciesand their exchanges have long been viewed as speculative outliers. That changed in May 2025, when Coinbase officially joined the S&P 500, replacing Discover Financial Services, which merged with Capital One Financial Corporation (COF). The move marks the first time acompany rooted in blockchain financesits alongside giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). \"Coinbase joining the S&P 500 means crypto's here to stay,\" said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Coinbase's inclusion in the index caused shares to jump and could lead to billions in buying from bothpassive and active funds, based on some estimates.That will bolster its liquidity and help stabilize its share price over time, while also serving as a vote of confidence for the crypto industry. However,crypto assets are still volatile, and their inclusion in the benchmark index does little to change this.Bitcoin, which first reached $100,000in 2024, dropped about 38% between early February 2025 and mid-April 2025, but then gained about 40% between mid-April and the end of May 2025. Coinbase represents (as of late May 2025) about 0.11% of the S&P 500's total value. That means if you have $10,000 in an S&P 500 fund, only about $11 is now tied to the crypto exchange. It's a small slice\u2014ranking about 180th in the index by market cap\u2014but could be just the beginning for crypto-related assets. Here's what Investopedia's analysis reveals: Over the past five years, bitcoin and the S&P 500 have moved in the same direction about 40% of the time (a correlation of 0.38 from the beginning of 2020 to late May 2025). That might not sound like much, but it's actually a significant relationship in the investing world. And during moments of market panic, like the massive sell-offs after theinitial Trump tariff announcementin April 2025, that connection jumped to nearly 90%, before settling down to about 70% (or 0.70) for the entire month. Crypto, in short, has largely failed to act as the \"hedge\" for the stock market that its proponents once promised. For Coinbase, specifically, its stock price has followed the S&P 500's movements about half the time (thecorrelationwas 0.53), virtually the same as its movements in relation to bitcoin (0.54), between its initial public offering in 2021 and late May 2025. What does this mean for you? If you thought your retirement account was safely diversified in boring old blue-chip stocks, think again. Your portfolio now has a direct line to the crypto rollercoaster, whether you bought a single bitcoin or not. Mainstream legitimacy:Coinbase\u2019s inclusion could pave the way for other blockchain-based companies to join the index. More risk/more potential rewards: Some crypto assets have outperformed traditional equities over the past decade. Broader access:Millions get exposure without buying crypto directly. Increased volatility:Crypto\u2019s price swings could inject more turbulence into the S&P 500. It's still crypto: Coinbase still faces ongoing regulatory investigations and cyber threats. Contagion risk: Stronger crypto-stock connections could amplify market shocks. Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 could mark yet another turning point for Wall Street's relationship with the crypto industry. Investors inindex fundsand retirement accounts are now, by default, exposed to the ups and downs of digital assets. While this brings new opportunities for growth anddiversification, it also means the S&P 500 is a little less insulated from crypto\u2019s wild swings.",

Inanother impressive showing, the apex AI tickercharged through the tech sector malaiseand delivered. But the quarterly beat also came with a warning: The company will miss out on $8 billion worth of H20 chip sales in its second quarter, due to tightened export controls. At first glance, the missing revenue highlights the risks of doing business with the nation's economic adversary \u2014 this time from the demand side, not the supply side, like Amazon and Apple. Trump is building on a policy from the Biden years to limit China's ability to source American technology. And so Nvidia has to forfeit billions of potential sales. But the misfortune of being locked in the middle of geopolitical tensions can work in your favor. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sCondicionesandPol\u00edtica de privacidad As Beijing and Washington talk their way through the next phase of their tariff truce, Nvidia's disadvantage could swiftly turn into an edge. The chip ban can be wielded as a bargaining chip in the broader China trade war. \"The ongoing US/China negotiations could yield positive results for Nvidia over the coming months that could get Nvidia back in the China H20 game (with a new restricted chip) and ultimately the $8 billion run rate could easily come back to the Nvidia story,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note on Thursday. After all, China still wants chips. CEO Jensen Huang is saying all the right things too. He touted the company's plansto manufacture its AI chips in the US, while framing the export controls as a policy failure. Instead of holding China back, Huang said it will hamstring Nvidia by keeping it out of a huge AI market and stymie American national security interests. Jensen knows that his company is caught in the China tariff storm, but there's a possibility he can artfully slip out of it. Nvidia punctuates a Magnificent Seven earnings seasonthat largely surpassed expectations. Their tickers, however, tell a more nuanced story, with the majority in the red for the year, entangled in the back-and-forth of trade policies. Narratives of transformative AI development and growth haven't gone unscathed. But they persist. And while there are real, costly risks from being pushed and pulled as a part of global trade deals, there's a clear path for Nvidia's problems to simply disappear.

        "content": "TheNasdaq Compositeis only at about breakeven for the year, as of this writing, but it's made a powerful comeback in recent weeks. The tech-heavy index is now down less than 1% year to date, a massive improvement from the drop of more than 20% it recorded in early April. That doesn't mean it's too late to own tech names that are thriving from the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Here are three names that are in a prime position to benefit from the expansion of generative and agentic AI in the enterprise, education, healthcare, and beyond. Image source: Getty Images. The best way to profit from any growing field is to build an ecosystem around it. Think about how successfulApplehas been with its app store, iPhone, Mac computers, and iCloud offerings. That's the approachNvidia(NVDA3.23%)is taking with hardware, software, andarchitecture for AI. CEO Jensen Huang is a proven visionary, and the company even has growth triggers beyond the world of AI. AI is enabling change and improvement in every industry. Uses includegenerative AIand speech recognition, medical imaging and more efficient supply chain management. Nvidia is delivering enterprises the computing power, systems, tools, and algorithms needed. It's not just the powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) like Blackwell and the next-generation Rubin AI chips that Nvidia supplies, either. Nvidia's NeMo provides a full platform for developing custom generative AI -- includinglarge language models (LLMs), video models, and conversational AI. Its CUDA (compute unified device architecture) software platform allows developers to leverage Nvidia's leading chips using parallel processing power for more intensive applications. Nvidia's CUDA-Q is a quantum development platform enabling the use of large-scalequantum computing applications. This is just a small sample of examples showing Nvidia's reach throughout the ecosystem. Nvidia is heavily involved even at the earliest stages of building AI factories where enterprises can deploy on-premises scalable, high-performance, AI platforms. Nvidia is also part of larger-scale projects like the recently announced United Arab EmiratesStargate global tech alliance. That will become a massive 1-gigawatt compute capacity data center. These offerings and projects all create a flywheel effect that should only increasedemand for Nvidia's productsin the months and years ahead. It won't be the only beneficiary, though. Other obvious places to look next are Nvidia's direct upstream and downstream partners. Taiwan Semiconductor(TSMC)(TSM0.51%)fabricates many of the advanced chips that Nvidia and othermajor semiconductor companiesdesign. So it shouldn't be surprising that the Nvidia supplier and partner saw revenue surge nearly 42% higher in the first quarter. Those are profitable sales, too. Net income soared 60% versus the prior-year period.TSMC is also well on its wayto accomplishing the approximately 40% revenue growth guidance it provided for the current quarter. April net sales jumped 48.1% compared to 2024.  One Nvidia customer that is also positioned to benefit from growth in data centers and AI compute capacity isDell Technologies(DELL-0.14%). Dell is also a partner, working closely with Nvidia. It recently announced the \"Dell AI Factory with Nvidia,\" which it says is \"designed to help enterprises accelerate AI adoption and achieve faster time to value.\" Dell is using its latest air- and liquid-cooled server solutions for AI servers and racks containing Nvidia hardware to deploy in data centers. The collaboration will help accelerate enterprises ramping up computing power. Dell is quickly gaining business in this area. Its server and networking revenue surged 37% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. At that time, the company said its server business backlog more than tripled year over year to $9 billion. All three companies play an important role in the booming artificial intelligence field. Each has its own role and expertise. Investors would do well to own all three to participate in the growth over the course of 2025 and beyond.",

        "content": "Many of the best growth stocks in the world are based out of the U.S. This is the land of both opportunity and innovation. Warren Buffett has always been bullish on betting on the U.S. because he's a big believer in American business. If you want to follow suit and invest in some of the country's best growth stocks, there are three excellent names that I don't think you can go wrong with in the long term:Nvidia(NVDA3.23%),Eli Lilly(LLY0.21%), andPalo Alto Networks(PANW-1.04%). These three stocks are growth beasts, and they still have plenty more room to run over the long haul. Image source: Getty Images. Chipmaking giant Nvidia, one of the most valuable companies in the world, is based out of Santa Clara, California. Its history goes back more than 30 years to 1993.One of the remarkable features of this business is that it has had only one CEO, Jensen Huang, who co-founded the company. That's a good sign of continuity and underscores just how stable the business has been over the years. In its most recent fiscal year, which ended on Jan. 26, the company reported $130 billion in revenue, which was more than double the $61 billion it posted a year earlier, as demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips remains robust. But what impresses me most is just how incredible itsprofit marginsare: typically well north of 50%. Nvidia is based in the U.S. but it isn't immune to the effects of tariffs or trade wars, especially with China being a key market for its operations. But with such high profit margins, it's in much better shape than other companies to be able to absorb higher costs and headwinds related to economic uncertainty. That's why this can be a no-brainergrowth stockto buy right now. Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly is another great American growth stock to buy and hold. Founded in 1876, its history goes back nearly 150 years. And for decades, the business has been developing vital medicines for people to help improve their lives. One of the more exciting ones of late has been related to weight loss and obesity. Its GLP-1 drug Tirzepatide resulted in two highly successful products for Eli Lilly: Zepbound for weight loss and Mounjaro for diabetes. Together, those drugs generated more than $6 billion in sales through the first three months of 2025, representing nearly half of the top line, which rose by 45%. What's exciting here is that there is still so much potential for these drugs to generate more growth since they are still in their early stages. Plus, there are studies suggesting that GLP-1 drugs could even help with substance abuse by curbing addictions, which means there may be even more indications that tirzepatide is approved for in the future. And yet, Eli Lilly's business goes beyond just GLP-1, which is why this can be a fantastic growth stock to buy and hold.Tariffs could increase its costs, and a global trade war would affect its bottom line. But it, too, has some solid profit margins at around 22%. Rounding out this list of impressive American growth stocks is Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity company founded 20 years ago. Like Nvidia, its headquarters is also in Santa Clara. And as all things related to AI grow, businesses and consumers alike will need to ramp up their cybersecurity. Since the need for cybersecurity is ongoing, the company benefits from a large chunk of its top line being from recurring revenue. Its subscription and support segment generated $1.8 billion in sales for the quarter ended April 30, which accounted for 80% of its top line (product revenue made up the rest). And while overall revenue rose by 15%, the annualized recurring revenue for the company's next-generation security rose by 34%. Palo Alto's profit margin of 15% is light when compared to the other stocks on this list, but that's still a solid percentage of revenue flowing through to its bottom line. And it's a big improvement from just a few years ago when the business was still in the red. Results for the company's fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended April 30) included revenue of $2.3 billion, up from $2 billion a year ago. GAAP net income was unchanged at $300 million for the quarter. Palo Alto has come a long way in recent years, and while it may look like an expensive stock, trading at more than 100 times its trailing earnings, that valuation should improve as it continues to scale up and its margins get even better. While Palo Alto may experience a slowdown in business if a trade war affects spending, its top line relies heavily on software and support services, making it less vulnerable to tariffs than other stocks. For long-term investors, this can be another solid stock to own given the huge opportunities in cybersecurity in the years ahead.",

        "header": "Mag 7 valuations before & after Nvidia earnings: Chart of the Day",
        "content": "Now thatNvidia's(NVDA) earnings are in the books, Yahoo Finance hostJulie Hymantakes a look at what Big Tech's valuations and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios look like right now, particularly for the \"Magnificent Seven.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Now, with Nvidia in the books in terms of its earnings, we do see investors taking another look at Nvidia individually, as well as the big tech sector collectively, as exemplified by the magnificent seven. And this prompted me to take a look at what we see in terms of the forward price earnings ratios. What do valuations look like for the mega cap tech trade right now? And what's notable is that really this year, we've seen Nvidia in particular come down quite a bit in terms of its valuation. That's something that a lot of investors have pointed out, and it's now sort of more comparable with its peers within the mag 7. Even though it looks like there's a lot of dispersion now, as I'll show you in a moment, there's not a lot of space in between many of the mag 7 names. And in particular, when it comes to Nvidia, we talked to Angelo Zeno, CFRA yesterday in reaction to the Nvidia earnings, and he flagged that the valuation looks more attractive right now. expect anything along the lines of what we've seen here over the last two years, I think that's perfectly okay, because when you look at Nvidia's multiple today, um, relative to what we've seen here in recent memory, it's nowhere near the levels that we've seen it. So in other words, what he was saying is that even though we're not seeing the kind of magnitude of growth that we once were for Nvidia, it's still quite high, but it's not as high as it was. That's okay, because you're not paying up as much for the stock. Now, just to get a little more granular here, I wanted to look at the exact numbers for this estimated PE here for these companies. Now, you see Nvidia here at 31, which is pretty comparable with most of its cohort. Right now, Alphabet is priced the lowest in these terms at 18. Then you have Meta 25, Apple 28, Microsoft 30, Nvidia 31, and Amazon. Of course, the outlier here is Tesla. That's why we didn't put it on the other chart, because it would have skewed the whole thing, because its price earnings ratio, both on a trailing and forward basis, is much, much higher than the others. That's one of the reasons that some of the bears are not into that stock. But it is interesting to see this current landscape now that we are through the earning season.",

        "content": "Shares in semiconductor test equipment companyAehr Test Systems(AEHR-0.90%)rose by 12.5% in the week to Friday. It's been a good week for semiconductor stocks in general, and a good week for Aehr's probable new customers as well. You can usually get a good sense of where a small company is headed by examining its customers' spending plans, and that's certainly the case with Aehr. Unfortunately, it's a lot harder to read the tea leaves this year. Traditionally, its largest customer isON Semiconductor, to which Aehr sells silicon carbide wafer-level burn-in (SiC WLBI) solutions. For reference, SiC WLBI sales accounted for 90% of Aehr's business in 2024. Still, as disclosed on the recent fiscal third quarter 2025 earnings call, \"this year it's tracking to less than 40%, with artificial intelligence (AI) processors burn-in representing over 35%.\" ON Semiconductor and other SiC companies are suffering this year due to their focus on the automotive electric vehicle (EV) market. Aehr has diversified into other markets, attracting new customers in turn. CEO Gayn Erickson disclosed that Aehr had four customers representing 10% of its revenue in the third quarter. Assuming ON Semiconductor is the customer in SiC WLBI, this leaves three other customers: two in separate AI processor markets and one in the gallium nitride (GaN) WLBI market. Image source: Getty Images. While these three customers aren't named, they might be names likeNvidiaor one of the hyperscalers in AI. Meanwhile, a company likeNavitas Semiconductor(whichannounced a significant deal with Nvidia recently) could be the GaN customer. Moreover, Nvidia'searnings report this weekconfirmed the AI market remains in a growth trajectory. In short, investors bid up the stock on positive news flow from customers in its end markets.",

A federal appeals courtreinstated President Donald Trump's wide-ranging tariffsThursday, a day after atrade court struck downsome of the import taxes.The ruling by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals allows the tariffs Trump imposed last month to stay in place while the courts decide on their legality. The ruling affects Trump's 10% tariff against most countries, as well as the higher\"reciprocal\" tariffsagainst certain trade partners, which he suspended until July to give trading partners time to negotiate trade deals. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a TV interview that negotiations with China on tariffs hadbecome \u201ca bit stalled\u201dafter Trumptemporarily reduced those tariffs from 145% to 30%earlier this month. Inflation is expected to have cooled to itslowest level since Septemberwhen the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for April is released at 8:30 a.m. ET.\u00a0The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation is expected to have declined to an annual rate of 2.2% from 2.3% in March, according to a survey of economists byThe Wall Street JournalandDow Jones Newswires. The report is expected to show that the\"core\" inflation rate, which takes out volatile food and gas prices, remained at 2.6% in April. Costco Wholesale (COST) posted fiscal third-quarter results thatcame in slightly better than analysts projected.The bulk retailer reported net income of\u00a0$4.28 per share on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year to $63.21 billion, both coming in just ahead of Visible Alpha estimates.

        "content": "Tariffs remain in focus as earnings season continues to wind down, but there are still a number of key companies due to report in the coming week. On the back of a strong set of results from chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA), attention will now turn to rival Broadcom (AVGO), which is due to report on Thursday. Athletics wear company Lululemon (LULU) is also due to report on Thursday, with focus on its outlook for the current year, after guidance offered at the end of the last financial year failed to impress investors. In London, investors will want to see if British American Tobacco (BATS.L) has continued to generate sales growth from its new categories business, which includes vapes and heated products. Investors will also be keen to see how Dr Martens (DOCS.L) turnaround efforts are progressing when the iconic bootmaker reports its full-year results on Thursday. On the Paris bourse, R\u00e9my Cointreau's (RCO.PA) full-year performance will be in focus, ahead of a new CEO taking the helm at the French spirits company later in June. Here's more on what to look out for: Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) jumped after it reportedanother blowout quarteron Wednesday, despite the company warning of the impact of export controls that limit its ability to ship products to China. The chipmaker posted revenue of $44.1bn (\u00a332.7bn) for the first quarter, beating expectations of $43.3bn, though earnings per share of $0.81 came in below estimates of $0.93. Derren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The first key takeaway from Nvidia's (NVDA) Q1 print was that demand for accelerated computing remains extremely strong due to the lightning speed roll out of AI. The second is that Nvidia remains the dominant force in this market.\" \"However, with McKinsey predicting a spend of around $7tn to help data centres keep pace with processing demands out to 2030, the market is big enough to accommodate more than just one player,\" he added. \"Broadcom\u2019s (AVGO) custom ASIC chips can help hyperscalers lower their average cost of data processing and as such it looks well set to grow its share of the market.\" Read more:What's behind the surge in AI-related lawsuits? Nathan said that consensus forecasts for Broadcom's (AVGO) second quarter revenue are broadly in line with the company's guidance of approximately $14.9bn, which works out to growth of around 19%. He highlighted that artificial intelligence (AI) is a \"growing share of Broadcom\u2019s (AVGO) revenue base but there\u2019s still more sales coming from non-AI workloads leaving the company exposed to cyclical ups and downs, which is a risk in today\u2019s macroeconomic environment. And with 20% of revenue coming from China, markets will be keen to hear the potential impact of export restrictions and tariffs.\" Nathan added that estimates for Broadcom's (AVGO) third quarter revenue have been falling slightly over the last month and currently stand at $15.8bn. \"But with so many moving parts to the picture the company\u2019s steer will be a key metric to focus on,\" he said. Broadcom (AVGO) shares popped after the company postedfirst quarter resultsin March that beat on the top and bottom lines, driven by AI chip sales. Adjusted net revenue came in at $14.92bn, versus expectations of $14.61bn, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 were ahead of estimates of $1.50. However, fluctuations in the stock since then have left it up just 4.4% year-to-date. Shares in Lululemon (LULU) sunk after its earningsoutlook appeared to underwhelm investors, despite the company posting better-than-expected quarterly profits in March. The athletics wear retailer said it expected earnings per share for this year to be in the range of $14.95 to $15.15, which was below expectations of $15.37. On revenue, the company said it expected this to be in the range of $11.15bn to $11.3bn. In addition, Lululemon (LULU) chief financial officer (CFO) told investors on an earnings call that the company was not expecting store traffic to improve this year versus softness out of the gate in the first quarter. Read more:Stocks that are trending today In a note on 12 May, Barclays analysts \u2013 which had an \"equal weight\" rating on Lululemon (LULU) \u2013 said they were \"cautious\" on the stock. They highlighted that the retailer's \"We Made Too Much\" online clearance section \"showed an increase towards the end of the quarter\". \"During 1Q25, the WMTM category negatively inflected in the final few weeks of the quarter,\" they said. They said this suggested \"potential for weaker exiting trends and building inventory risk\". For the first quarter, Lululemon (LULU) said it expected net revenue to come in between $2.34bn and $2.36bn, which would represent growth of 6% to 7%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.53 to $2.58 for the quarter. On Wednesday, British American Tobacco (BATS.L) announced that it had sold a 2.5% stake in Indian consumer goods company ITC (ITC.NS), which was worth $1.5bn, according to aReuters report. The company said that the transaction would give it \"greater financial flexibility as it delivers on its commitment to invest behind transformation, deleverage and enhance shareholder returns.\" The tobacco giant also said that the net proceeds from the trade would be used to extend its existing share buyback programme by an additional \u00a3200m ($269.5m), taking the total amount it repurchases in 2025 to \u00a31.1bn. That was up on \u00a3900m BAT (BATS.L) said it planned to undertake in buybacks this year back in its preliminary results release in February. Shares tumbled after the release of those results, in which the company flagged \u00a36.2bn ($7.7bn) hit, from a proposed settlement of a long-running lawsuit in Canada. With this provision, the company posted reported profit from operations for the year of \u00a32.74bn. Read more:Government 'megafund' pension plans could give \u00a36k boost to savers BAT (BATS.L) posted a 5.2% decline in reported revenue for the year at \u00a325.9bn, driven by the sale of its businesses in Russia and Belarus in September 2023 and transnational foreign exchange headwinds. However, the company saw 8.9% organic growth from revenue in its new categories business at \u00a33.4bn. Nathan, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the company \"heads into its upcoming [first-half] trading update with investor attention firmly on its ability to navigate persistent industry headwinds\". \"Regulatory pressures and rising tobacco taxes continue to weigh on the outlook,\" he said. \"As such, this year\u2019s guidance for around 1% sales growth and 1.5\u20132.5% profit growth currently stands below the group\u2019s medium-term targets. The upcoming update will be closely watched for signs that 'new categories' can deliver more meaningful growth and help offset the structural decline in traditional tobacco.\" In addition, Nathan said that investors \"will be watching closely to see if US action to crackdown on illegal competition has had any impact and whether the lifting of a proposed ban on menthol cigarettes has helped the outlook\". According to consensus forecasts provided by the company on its website, analysts expect full-year total revenue for 2025 to come in at \u00a326.2bn, including \u00a33.88bn from new category business. Shortly after taking over as Dr Martens (DOCS.L) CEO in January, Ije Nwokorie said in a third quarter trading update that the bootmaker had made \"good progress\" on turning round performance in the US. He said that the team were focused on \"returning the business to sustainable and profitable growth\". In the third quarter, Dr Martens (DOCS.L) reported 3% growth in group revenue at \u00a3267m, with a 4% increase in direct-to-consumer business in the Americas. \"Dr Martens (DOCS.L) is expected to deliver more evidence that it is pulling itself up by its bootstraps and the turnaround is lacing together,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"It\u2019s been reducing inventories and debt, preserving cash and stabilising the business overall.\" Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio \"The iconic footwear company has found it hard going stomping new fashion ground overseas, with the US, its biggest market, proving particularly tough,\" she said. \"But in the key autumn/winter season, there were signs that increased investment in marketing was paying off, with new styles winning fans. It\u2019s trying to get the heritage models and new innovations in the fashion market.\" Streeter said that the \"performance of the last quarter will be a test\" for new CEO Nwokorie. She said that the company's \"strategy includes new store roll outs and increasing the direct-to-consumer mix, as well as improving the quality and depth of wholesale distribution. \"It\u2019s hoped that the Docs will also take a step forward with the appointment of a new chief brand officer, Carla Murphy, a former Adidas (ADS.DE) global executive who also has experience at VF Corporation, the American global apparel and footwear company.\" In its January trading update, company didn't offer specifics on its guidance for the full year but said its outlook remained unchanged and that it was on track to achieve its objectives. Despite signs of turnaround progress, the stock is still down nearly 19% year-to-date. French cognac maker R\u00e9my Cointreau (RCO.PA) announced on Wednesday that it had appointedFranck Marilly as the company's new CEO, taking over from Eric Vallat, who said last month he would be stepping down. Marilly, who assumes the role on 25 June, has previously worked for Japanese beauty brand Shiseido (4911.T), luxury fashion house Chanel and consumer goods giant Unilever (ULVR.L). The news comes as R\u00e9my Cointreau (RCO.PA) navigates challenges around trade tensions with both the US and China, two of its key markets. In a fourth quarter sales update in April, R\u00e9my Cointreau (RCO.PA) posted an 18% fall in full-year sales at \u20ac984.6m (\u00a3827.6m). The company flagged a \"steep decline\" in sales of cognac in China in the fourth quarter, which it said was partly down to \"harsh market conditions\", among other factors. Read more:UK 'bargain' stocks that have outperformed the market long-term In January, China launched ananti-dumping investigationon brandy imported from the European Union (EU), which was extended in April and included the imposing of temporary duties on imports of brandy. The probe was considered to be in response to EU duties on Chinese electric vehicles. R\u00e9my Cointreau (RCO.PA) said in its April sales update that if the provisional duties were confirmed, the company would \"trigger its action plan to mitigate the effects starting in fiscal 2025-26. The impact on fiscal year 2024-25 is marginal.\" In addition, there is also uncertainty around US tariffs on the EU, with talks between the two ongoing, after presidentDonald Trump hit pause on his threatto impose 50% duties on the bloc. Investors will be looking at R\u00e9my Cointreau's (RCO.PA) final full-year results on Wednesday for any commentary around the potential impact of these tariff challenges in the year ahead. The company said in April that a \u20ac50m (\u00a342m) cost-cutting plan would help protect its operating margin, expecting this to come in between 21% and 22% for the year. It also reiterated its financial targets for 2029-30 of hitting a gross margin of 72% and an operating margin of 33%.

        "content": "Shares of Gap Inc. (GAP) tumbled Friday morning after the apparel retailer warned of the negative impact of tariffs on its full-year earnings in its latest quarterly report. The retailer topped first-quarter estimates with earnings per share of $0.51 on $3.46 billion in revenue, but the outlook regarding tariffs outweighed the solid results. The operator of its namesake Gap stores along with Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta kept its full-year outlook the same as what itlaid out last quarterwith sales rising 1% to 2%, but noted that it does not include the impact of tariffs. If the tariffs stay in place, which has been called into question by a pair ofrecent court rulings, Gap estimates the cost at $250 million to $300 million. The company said it has \"strategies to mitigate\" at least half of the impact, meaning Gap's operating income could take a hit of $100 million to $150 million, largely in the back half of the year. CEO Richard Dickson said in Thursday's earnings call that the company does \"not expect there to be meaningful price impacts to our consumer,\" and said it is still approaching pricing like normal\u2014 evaluating competition, the consumer, and Gap's desire to provide value, per an AlphaSense transcript of the call. Gap said net sales for the second quarter are expected to be roughly flat year-over-year, compared to 2% growth in the first quarter. Comparable sales rose 2% in the quarter, as Gap's retail revenue was flat while online sales grew 6% in the quarter and made up nearly 40% of its total sales. Comparable sales rose 3% and 5% at its Old Navy and Gap brands, respectively, while Banana Republic's comp sales were flat and Athleta's fell by 8% year-over-year as the company works to \"reset the brand.\" Gap shares were down 14% in premarket trading. They entered the day up 18% on the year, as they had rallied more than 50% in the weeks leading up to Thursday's report.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg Markets) \u2014 On Wall Street, it\u2019s been years since anyone had to think very hard to make money. Buy the largest US stocks, ignore everything else and watch your portfolio soar. Investing was reduced to one-click simplicity. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Congestion Toll Brings In $216 Million in First Four Months Now With Colorful Blocks, Tirana\u2019s Pyramid Represents a Changing Albania The Economic Benefits of Paying Workers to Move NY Wins Order Against US Funding Freeze in Congestion Fight Why Arid Cities Should Stick Together Then life got more complicated. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden tariff escalation in April offered a glimpse of what a world without that certainty might look like. Confidence wavered\u2014not just in megacap resilience, but in American economic exceptionalism and Trump\u2019s market-friendly reputation. But after a sharp market decline, some of the panic subsided. The president backed away from some of his most dramatic tariff plans, and major US equity indexes bounced back. On May 28, a US trade court said many of Trump\u2019s tariffs were illegal, with the administration appealing the decision. Yet for many, the market and political mayhem highlighted the increasing fragility of the one-way buy-America trade. You can still see the shadows of all that doubt in the lower value of the dollar, in Moody\u2019s Ratings\u2019 (MCO) recent decision to downgrade America\u2019s debt, and in the steady drumbeat of money finding its way to anything that isn\u2019t just another bet on US stocks. A motley crew of finance professionals long dismissed as having complex and cautious strategies have been having their moment. With megacap valuations still looking stretched, these money managers are pitching a slew of allocation ideas to investors newly receptive to the age-old virtue of diversification. \u201cI am looking forward to this being a world again where prices matter,\u201d says Ben Inker, the co-head of asset allocation at Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, a money manager known for bull-market skepticism as well as its dedication to value investing. His GMO International Developed Equity Allocation Fund is up about 20% this year\u2014its biggest outperformance over the S&P 500 (^GSPC) since the strategy\u2019s 2006 inception. The fund has about half its assets in Europe and almost 30% in Japan. Meb Faber, too, has been waiting patiently for this. The founder of Cambria Investment Management LP has been calling the end of the US exceptionalism trade for years. Before 2025 his model, which spread money across regions and assets, had trailed the S&P 500 in 14 out of 16 years. Now people are seeing the virtues of contrarian strategies. \u201cNobody is interested in talking about or wanting any of these investments, and all of a sudden you just blink, and the next thing you know, they\u2019re outperforming,\u201d Faber says. Nothing lasts forever, Faber says. He points the 1980s, when international markets, Japan\u2019s in particular, left American equities in the dust. That episode foreshadowed the Nikkei 225\u2019s (^N225) two decades of woe. Fund flows highlight the shift away from the go-long-US trade. International equities are attracting money in droves. Exchange-traded funds holding value stocks, which typically snub the top-heavy Magnificent Seven tech stocks, have already seen $30 billion in inflows this year. Hedge funds attracted about $14 billion in cash this year through April, according to data compiled by fund administrator Citco. And quantitatively driven diversification strategies\u2014with names like risk parity and factor investing that seem designed to resist easy marketing\u2014are gaining fresh attention. Also on the hot list: buffer funds, a breed of ETF that employs stock options to limit a portfolio\u2019s downside while capping the upside. And there\u2019s been a revival of once-dormant techniques such as portable alpha, a way of using borrowed money to try to sprinkle some idiosyncratic bets on top of exposure to the market index. \u201cThere\u2019s not as big an opportunity cost in introducing diversification and having to sacrifice that core stock exposure,\u201d says Corey Hoffstein, chief investment officer of quantitative money manager Newfound Research, speaking of portable alpha. This year \u201chas been about making diversification look great again,\u201d says Dan Villalon, principal at AQR Capital Management LLC, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based manager of quant and hedge fund strategies. \u201cWe see it in every dimension: We see in equity markets. We see it in asset classes. We see it in alternative strategies.\u201d AQR has long warned that US dominance of equity markets is at risk and that investors are underdiversified. Of course, the push to spread out risks comes with big pitfalls. In an age of artificial intelligence advances, there\u2019s a constant fear of missing out on another Big Tech rally. Already, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)\u2014a key member of the Mag 7\u2014has roared back from its April depths, notching a near-30% return over the past month. Moreover, the leverage used in many market-defying strategies can easily backfire. And many of these techniques layer on cost and are poorly understood by clients. Villalon, for example, has been an outspoken critic of buffer funds. AQR has published research arguing that a simple mix of stocks and safe Treasury bills is a better bet for those seeking downside protection.Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at the research firm Morningstar Inc., likewise argues that most individual investors can do just fine with a low-cost, do-it-yourself version of diversification. Just own a broad of mix of different assets. \u201cI would argue that the basic principles of asset allocation are delivering beautifully this year\u2014the vanilla strategy of holding cash and bonds to cushion against equity losses has been a winning one. Diversifying equity exposure globally has also helped.\u201d And there\u2019s still a large chorus warning against giving up on stocks in the world\u2019s most dynamic economy. \u201cWith ever more complex investment products becoming available to retail investors, history keeps proving that a simple, diversified portfolio of large-cap stocks wins out,\u201d says Liz Miller, president of Summit Place Financial Advisors LLC. \u201cAlternative and structured investments can appeal to investors\u2019 fears of market volatility, but long-term growth comes from investing appropriately in equities and staying committed throughout market turmoil.\u201d Still, investors seem to have widened their view of the range of outcomes. For Vineer Bhansali, CIO and founder of LongTail Alpha LLC, it\u2019s been the busiest time since the onset of the pandemic. LongTail\u2019s name refers to the rare but extreme events that can occur at both ends of the bell curve of possible market outcomes; the firm sells strategies that hedge the really bad ones but often suffer losses in a bull market. Bhansali says clients are calling all day with concerns about high exposure to US stocks and market patterns breaking down. Recently, a $24 billion Australian pension fund allocated to the strategies. \u201cEverybody has a lot of US assets,\u201d Bhansali says. \u201cTrade, the reason this whole thing is happening, is a global phenomenon. Everybody gets pulled into it. Everybody\u2019s concerned about what happens to their old global asset allocation.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek YouTube Is Swallowing TV Whole, and It\u2019s Coming for the Sitcom Mark Zuckerberg Loves MAGA Now.

        "content": "You can catch Opening Bid onApple Podcasts,Spotify,YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The race to better compete with AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) is well underway. Enter Groq (GROQ.PVT). The company makes what it calls language processing units (LPUs). These LPUs are designed to make large language models run faster and more efficiently, unlike Nvidia GPUs that target training models. Groq\u2019s last capital raise was in August 2024, when it raised $640 million from the likes of BlackRock (BLK) and Cisco (CSCO). The company\u2019s valuation at the time stood at $2.8 billion, a fraction of Nvidia\u2019s more than $3 trillion market cap. It currently clocks in at $3.5 billion,according to Yahoo Finance private markets data. At the helm of Groq is founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. While at Google (GOOG), Ross designed the custom chips that the tech giant would go on to train its AI models on. Yahoo Finance Executive EditorBrian Sozzisits down on theOpening Bidpodcast with Ross to discuss his future plans for Groq. Ross is fresh off a trip with other key tech executives to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump in forging a deeper tech relationship with the country. Ross begins by sharing with Sozzi the conversations he had on the ground in Saudi Arabia. Welcome to a new episode of the opening bid podcast. I'm Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sai. Like I always say, it's the podcast, uh, that will make you a smarter investor, period. And of course, opening bids sponsored by our by our friends over at Vanguard, really exciting, uh, guest here uh for this particular episode. Go Grok, founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. Jonathan, good to see you. Uh, I've been following you.From afar, uh, on all the work you've been doing, so welcome to the podcast desk. For those not familiar with your company, because I think you get a looped in a lot with, uh, Nvidia. What, what do you do and what I guess what made you start the company? All right, so.Uh, thanks for having me. Amazing to be here. Um, we started the company back in 2016, back before people really knew what AI was, um, and my background, I actually started the Google AI chip called the TPU. 2016 he left, uh, realized that the rest of the world needed fast inference and so what we do is we build chips called LPUs.And LPUs are a little different than GPUs. GPUs are really good for training models. Training models is where you take all that data and you turn that data into something that's useful that can interpret the world and and say things. But inference is when you actually run that model, when it's useful. So whenever you go and you type into your favorite chatbot, you ask your questions, that's inference. We accelerate inference and we make it really low cost. You were part of the Moonshotsfactory, right? I was, so Google X's Rapid Eval team. So it's about 12 of us, and I was the person who was the expert in computing AI.And there were people who were experts in biology and we kept trying all these really interesting things. Yeah. Didyou realize the time what you created in that what was the teepeeyou said? Yeah, I think the first time I realized the scale of it was when Google did an earnings report and they mentioned that it had been responsible for over a billion dollars of revenue, and I actually started that as a 20% or side project. Can youbelieve what that has now come, what they're.Training on, I mean, I you still of course have to Google what they're working on. Absolutely and um they're still killing it. They're um ramping massive scale, um like the data centers that they're deploying are massive. Was ithard to, or to get more into what your company does, um, was it hard to go from being inside that Google environment that that startup mentality, but also obviously a very large company to founding your own company? So at the time I thought that I was doing a startup and I would be like I'm doing a startup in Google, and then when you go outside and you actually do a startup and you hear other people say that, you almost cringe because you're like, oh you have no idea. Like the near death experiences, the um having to get money at the last minute cause you're about to run out of cash. There was a point where we were 3 weeks from running out of cash and we got uh a fundraising just in time at Grok, yeah, yeah, have you had to.You know, how did you, I guess, develop your leadership style? I mean, it's one thing to lead a team inside of a giant tech company like Google, but I mean, you're the face of thecompany now. I am, and actually, uh, part of the deal when we started was I would never have to be CEO. I was the CTO for the 1st 2 years and then I became the CEO afterwards, and it wasn't natural for me, and I think this is a lesson for for people. If you really focus on getting good at almost anything and you actually spend your time on it, you can do it.Um, but it, it's very much about, um, being open to feedback, right? This is the number one thing that prevents someone from crossing the gap, from being a technical founder to being a CEO.No one knows how to manage people. Every single thing that you do wrong is wrong because it's counterintuitive. And so you have to be able to listen to other people who know what they're doing in order to fix things that are counterintuitive problems. So you sounded like a completely different leader today than you were 2 years ago. Absolutely, yeah, 6 years ago or even 6years ago. So let's, you know, on Grok, um, LPUs, when you say they're used to, to train for inference, for inference, how is that different thanThe stuff that Nvidia sells, it gets a lot of hype over. Yeah, so think of it this way. Suppose you're a car company. You design cars, you manufacture cars. Training is the designing, inference is the manufacturing, it's the production. And the way that you should think about this as a financial investor, if you want to understand what the market is so crazy about right now, um, you wanna think in tokens, mega tokens of capacity. So when you buy electricity, you buy 1 kilowatt hour, and it costs a couple of cents.Uh, when you buy intelligence, you buy it in mega tokens, and a token is kind of like the syllables that the AI uses to construct words. Every word that comes out on average is about 1.4 tokens. Those 1.4 tokens, you put a million of them together, that's a mega token. That's what people sell, and that costs a couple of cents. What is it wrong to compare you to Nvidia? Um, it's, it's a little bit hard to compare us to Nvidia because we, we don't just sell this hardware, but we do. So, um, we also sell a service on top. So if you're currently using um OpenAI Anthropic, uh, Google Gemini, uh, you can also use all of the open source models that are available on us as a token as a service, but we also do deploy the hardware for customers. So for example, we just did an amazing deal with Bell Canada.And in that deal we're standing up we're we're build operate transfer we're building and operating uh the systems they provide the data center, we provide the hardware we provide the software and then we work together to bring customers onto that system. So I interview, you know, I've interviewed CEOs of AMD Intel, um, a lot of more Qualcomm, a lot of more traditional players. When investors come to you and ask you, you know, what's the pitch, you know, and, and maybe you want to raise more money from them. What do you tell them? Like, what's your growth? Well, back in back in 2016, we first had to explain what inference even was. There the market didn't have a division between training and inference, so we would explain that.Nowadays we don't have to explain that and what we say is we've been focused on inference from the beginning. And the main difference between the two when you are training a model and you put it into production later, you get to amortize that over um millions of users who are using that model over a long period of time. But, um, inference, you're paying for every single query. So you spend money on training, you make your money on inference. If you're spending too much on inference, you can't make money.Most of the companies that are out there, most of them are actually burning VC dollars in order to build AI companies. Uh, we've seen a bunch of customers come to us recently who are spending more on the tokens, the intelligence, than they're making in revenue. Some of them, it's razor thin close, and when they come to us, they want to be able to lower their spend in order to become profitable or in order to get more money so that they can build a business. So as the next wave, I guess, um, with AI.Are those tail ends by a company like yours. I'm trying to figure out, you know, I, for the past 10 years of my life I've been talking about Nvidia and like I've watched this company grow significantly, but I hear something else happening uh within yourcompany. So the main pitch to the customer is build fast. So with AI it's about speed. Um, you go to a room full of people and you ask what's gonna happen in a year in AI? No one knows, right? And so.Um, Jensen went on stage at GTC, their big yearly conference, and he said, if you want to spend $100 billion.Over, uh, and, and have um hardware in 2 years in your data center. There's only one company in the world that you can trust to do that, and that's Nvidia, and I agree with that statement. But where people come to us is they don't want to wait 2 years. They want to be able to spend $100 million and have a bunch of chips set up in 3 months, and then they want to be able to spend a billion dollars and then have that in 6 months.Then spend $10 billion.06 months later have that and then spend $100 billion.06 months later and have that. And if you want to do that, there's only one company in the world you can go to and that's Grok. So we're built fast and 51 days from signing the agreement in Saudi Arabia, we stood up 20,000 chips and we're serving production traffic and with the Bell Canada deal as an example, the CEO went on stage and he said there's a lot of people out there who are announcing things that are in the future.We're not, like, the chips are already stood up. We already have chips in production right now in their data center.That's very different from what you're hearing around the world. Most AI it's like it's gonna come. The problem with that is the economics. So you also heard Jensen go on stage and call himself the chief revenue destroyer. Do you know what he meant by that? I did it actually. So what he meant was, he was trying to get his sales team to stop selling H-100 GPUs. They were still selling them to customers, but they were obsolete already because they had the Blackwell GPU.And if it takes you, and we hear this all the time, we'll talk to customers who put in an order, 12 months later, they still don't have their GPUs, let alone have them stood up and earning money. So if you're gonna buy a GPU and it's gonna take you 12 months, 24 months to get it, and you only have a 3 to 4 year life cycle on that before it's obsolete, that really only gives you 2, maybe 3 years where you can earn money off of that, and then it's obsolete.And so what you need is built fast. You need to be able to get those chips in production as quickly as possible, earning revenue as quickly as you can. Is this the next or the next Coke and Pepsi battle? Is it Grok versus Nvidia? Do you view it that way? Just the fact you're even mentioning their name, a lot of other CEOs at those old big companies wouldn't even mention theircompetitor. Well, you have to mention Nvidia. They are the 3 trillion pound gorilla, right? But um I actually from a shareholder point of view, I think Grok is gonna be one of the best things that's ever happened to Nvidia.And the reason I say that is Nvidia has a very special ingredient called HBM high bandwidth memory. It's made by Samsung, it's made by SK Heinix, it's made by Micron. The GPU itself in an Nvidia GPU or an AMD GPU is made of the same process, the the chip fabrication process that's used to build mobile phone chips. They can make an infinite number of them, inexpensively.The problem is that HBM or high bandwidth memory, which is only built for servers. There's a very limited capacity in the world, it's very expensive, they cannot make more. Nvidia is a monopsony. That means for your audience, it's not a monopoly, which is a single seller. Monotony is a single buyer. Nvidia is purchasing most of the HBM.And that limits how many GPs they can build. So they want to build 3 to 5 million this year.They can only build as many as they have memory to do that.If they were to sell those GPUs for inference, inference is a lower margin business. They would be forced to lower margins. They have no choice. So what you do is lower margin. What we do is lower margin. We have lower costs to begin with, and then on top of that, lower margin. So when you deploy a GPU just the electricity cost to run that GPU is more than the total cost per token when you're running LPUs.On top of that, we lower the margin below, so it's even more economical.Now, because every time you deploy more inference, there's demand for even better models. There's demand for more training, which means those 3 to 5 million GPUs that they're gonna produce are still going to be sold at a high margin for training, and they're not gonna have to bring their margin down. So for the Nvidia shareholders, I mean this may not be the way they look at it at the leadership team of Nydia, but for the shareholders, we're one of the best things that's happened to Nvidia. Uh, hang with us, we're gonna go off for a quick break. We'll be right back on opening bid.All right, welcome back to Opening Bid, of course, sponsored by our friends at Vanguard, having a fun chat here with Grok, founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. Um, as someone, I mean, clearly you're in the trenches with this stuff, how powerful are some of these AI AI models getting and what are some of the concerns you're starting to have? Um, from a power point of view, let's first talk about it from a business point of view. What is it that you can actually accomplish with a modern LLM?There's a technological analogy here. I would, I would compare it to the information age. So the information age is about uh replicating data with high fidelity and distributing it to the world. Uh, that's what phones do, it's what the internet does. It's what the printing press did, right? Same concept.When we were first fundraising, I was asked, is AI um the next internet?And the answer is absolutely not, because the internet is an information age technology. AI is not. AI is not about copying, it's not about replicating. It's about generating a contextually relevant, creative answer that is customed to the situation.And right now, we're in the printing press era of AI, the very beginning, the very primitive start. That's why most people, when they're trying to build their applications, it can't do what they're trying to do cause they're thinking of it as, what could a human do?What AI can do today is it's a what I call language user interface. So you know what a GUI is or a graphical user interface. When you use your phone when you use your phone, there's buttons. Back in the 1970s, computers didn't have buttons. You had to type all of these commands and you had to memorize the commands. Otherwise you couldn't use the computer. What the graphical user interface gave you was the ability to look at a screen, see a button and get a sense of what you could do. It was a huge advancement. It made it much easier to use a computer.Language user interfaces are gonna revolutionize using computers because now you just speak to it. You don't have to know what it can do. You talk to it. And you know how these models can translate from English to Spanish or French or whatever. Well, they can translate your voice into actions, into button pushes, into this sort of thing. They're very good at being a language user interface.If you do something like that, so think of customer service. Customer service, it's a language user interface to the business. Um, if you're doing, um, programming, it's a language user interface to telling the computer what to do. Perfect fit.But now you start asking it to be intelligent, and it's not quite there yet, right? If you ask it to invent something, it can't do that. Why can't it do that? Well, what the LLMs do is they give you the most probable next token, which is the syllable of the LLM.The most probable is the most obvious, and if it's the most obvious, it's not gonna be good writing, it's not gonna be a good science, it's not gonna invent something for you, it's not gonna invent a drug that isn't known.That's what we're working on next. That's, that's next. But actually there's some other steps too. The, the next thing you're gonna see is you're gonna see Agentic. So the reason Agentic doesn't work so well yet, but by the end of the year it may, is you have to get the model good enough where it can fix its own mistakes, recognize and fix its own mistakes. I write some code, I get an error. How do I fix it?It's a little bit like the difference between um a ballistic missile or guided missile. Ballistic missile, you have to get it right from the beginning to be able to get to your target, right? When you ask a query and you have to get an exact answer, that's like a ballistic missile, no corrections. Whereas when you're guided, it's sort of like it can see the air, it can fix it, and it can start correcting as it's writing the code, right?Um, and then we're gonna start seeing hallucinations reduced over time. That's next. It's, it's getting better. It's, and none of these are binary. It's not like one day it'll stop hallucinating or I prefer to say make errors as opposed to hallucinates hallucinations just sound better, but it, but it doesn't clearly articulate the problem. The problem is LLMs make mistakes and they're always gonna make mistakes, but they're gonna make fewer and fewer.At some point they will make so few mistakes, you can use it in medicine, you can use it in law, but you can't now, right? That's gonna get better. So we're just gonna see them getting better and better, and I think over the next 5 years, you'll see hallucinations go down, you'll see agenttic, you'll see inventiveness, and then lastly, you'll see alignment enough where the models will be able to accept coming on to a podcast. So in our lifetime.Very well within our lifetime, but you need all those steps before you get to AGI. AGI is not around the corner. You'll see each of those solved before we get anywhere close to AGI. Do you share umOcta co-founder or uh Tom McKinnon's, his concerns that with Agenta comes security problems. So there's already been some interesting results, one of them from Google. So Google, um, you know what a zero day exploit is? Um, so a zero day, a zero day exploit is an exploit that you find in software that you can immediately use um to to get around the security, to get into the system or or to manipulate the system in some undesired way.And Google, using an LLM found for the very first time, a security vulnerability that wasn't yet known.It it people didn't know it existed.Security has always been a cat and mouse game, always. Um, the people doing the security do a really great job securing the systems. You find one vulnerability you're in, the security people figure that out and they fix it. What's gonna happen now is you're gonna see LLMs that are trying to find security vulnerabilities, and they're gonna get better at it, but this is the inventive part, right? This is why it's not happening very widespread yet. They're not very good at this yet.But then you're also gonna need to see AI LLMs, um, patching the vulnerabilities, detecting and patching as quickly as possible. And so it's gonna be what it's always been. Technology advances and people use the tools. How big you were on that trip um with a lot of other big uh tech executives uh to Saudi Arabia, President Trump, Elon, Jensen, AMDCL, Lisa Su.How big is the sovereign AI opportunity? I've talked to a few folks that have gone to that trip. I haven't gotten a number. How big is it for your company? So, um, I would say that the demand for compute, and let's let's go back to what people are buying, right? I, we talked about tokens, we talked about mega tokens as the unit of um intelligence and and what people are buying. Imagine trying to run a civilization or a society without having energy, without having power plants.And we have a stack up that um we we don't really think about much in civilization, which is there were materials. There were the Iron Age, the the stone age, right, material ages. Then we got into the industrial age. The industrial age was about energy. That's where oil became important, coal became important, wood became, you know, for burning for for heat, right?Uh, and then we got into the information age where it was all about having information to run your society. Those were the three layers of a civilization and you needed all three of those things. Now we've added another, compute. Compute used to only be provided by human beings. Now we can artificially do compute. We can artificially think and add intelligence to society.You're not gonna be able to be competitive without it.Now, if you were trying to build a society that could manufacture, then you needed energy. The more energy you had, the more manufacturing plants you could build, the more you could produce, the bigger your GDP. That's gonna be what we're gonna see with intelligence. You're gonna need more intelligence to be able to be part of the AI or the the generative age that's coming, right?And sovereign entities want that. For example, um, with Bell Canada, we're going after um the Canadian sovereign uh push, right? They're, uh, I think they've already announced $2 billion for that. Then you see in the Middle East massive pushes. We're seeing like hundreds of billions of dollars um of funding going towards that, and their ambition isn't just for in their country, they actually want to power the region. So when we think of this, think of it as producing a barrel of oil, right?So if you had um 25 million tokens per second of capacity, that'd be like a barrel of oil every 4 seconds. If you're doing a billion tokens per second, that's the equivalent of about 10 barrels of oil per second, or about 7% of the revenue of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.They want to become net exporters of intelligence, the way that they're net exporters of energy at the moment. It feels like my IQ is going up in real time listening to you now. This is like fascinating stuff, but before I let you go, um, our private market data at Yahoo finds has your company valued at $3.5 billion. Uh, just listening to your story and what you're working on.Investors have to be giving you money hand over fist. You're out there trying to raise more money to achieve what you want to do. So we're not trying to raise any money. Um, we had a very oversubscribed round, so we raised, um, I think publicly it's $640 million. It's actually more more than that, but, but we haven't announced, um, what it was, and we're, we're good for now. Um, we may might take some strategic money from people that we're working with, but not, not just as a purely financial investment. So you don't.Like what are you building? The capital that you raised? Are you building new plants, structures, hiring, or all of it? So the way that we operate, um, we have a very capital intensive business. You, you heard, um, Microsoft announcing what was it $75 billion a year, um, I forget, Google, what are they? 80 billion metas 65, 60, um, and Amazon $100 billion a year, uh, that also includes the data center side of it.Now for us everyone's um opex is someone else's capex. They're treating data centers as capex because they're paying for it because they're doing so much.We use about 1/3 of the energy per token we produce, and our chips are air cooled rather than liquid cooled. So we can use the existing data centers, we don't have to build new ones. So for us, we don't need anywhere near as much money. The data centers are the majority that spend. We don't have to do that. We're using other people, so we're using Bell Canada's data centers. We're using um uh Humane's data centers in Saudi Arabia, right? Uh, we're using Equinix's data center. We're using all sorts of data centers all over the place. That's their business. They can do that then.We partner with someone like Bell Canada, Humane or any of these other partners who then put up the capex for us to deploy our hardware.And um one of the reasons telcos like working with us is they're very good at a geography, they're amazing at building out a geography, amazing infrastructure. What we do is we work with them, they build out a geography, and then we connect that into our global network because inference is a global problem. You can't do it locally. Training you can do locally, inference has to be around the world because you build an app, a service, everyone has to be able to access it low latency and um we work with them and now we're building out this global inference platform.And they each bring a part of it, we run it, we bring the the software, we bring the models onto it, um, and then we share that revenue. So it's a very different model, but for us it's quite capex light, and there's plenty of other people who want to invest in Capex and we work with them. Folks, pay attention to Jonathan, pay attention to Grok. I can't tell you how many of you have messaged me over the years on on X, LinkedIn saying we missed Nvidia, we missed all these great next AI opstarts.This guy's clearly working on something very, very fascinating.

The stock jumped 4%, adding $130 billion in market value. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. China was 12.5% of Q1 revenue, as buyers rushed to grab Nvidia's H20 chip before the ban kicked in. But new U.S. rules targeting Chinese AI models and connected-car tech are now clouding the outlook. CEO Jensen Huang praised Trump for scrapping one export rule, but slammed another for blocking H20 sales. His pitch: let Chinese AI run on U.S. chips it's better for America. Senators raised concerns over a new Nvidia lease in Shanghai. The company says it's just more space for existing staff. Huang's betting on new deals in the Middle East and sees a future built on U.S. robotics. The China risk is real, but he's not slowing down. Seeinsider tradesfor NVDA. ExplorePeter Lynch chart.

China was once a $50 billion opportunity, but the company now has no replacement chip ready for the banned H20 model. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Despite the hit, Nvidia forecast $45 billion in July-quarter sales and pointed to strength in its Blackwell chips, designed for AI inference.

Huang described it as a sharp jump in inference demand, with cloud partners like Microsoft (MSFT,Financials) making up half of Nvidia's $39.1 billion in data center revenue. Microsoft alone deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs. Analysts remain upbeat.

The race to better compete with Nvidia (NVDA) is well underway. Enter well-funded private company Groq (GROQ.PVT), led by chip veteran Jonathan Ross. While at Google (GOOG), Ross designed the custom chips that the tech giant would go on to use for training its AI models. Ross tells me his startup, founded in 2016, is finding numerous opportunities to wrestle business away from the iron grips of AI chip titan Nvidia by moving quicker. \"[Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang] said, if you want to spend $100 billion and have hardware in two years in your data center, there's only one company in the world that you can trust to do that, and that's Nvidia,\" Ross said on a new episode of Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bidpodcast (see video above; listen below). \"I agree with that statement. But where people come to us is they don't want to wait two years.\" \"They want to be able to spend $100 million and have a bunch of chips set up in three months. ... And if you want do that, there's only one company in the world you can go to, and that's Groq.\" The company makes what it calls language processing units (LPUs). These LPUs are designed to make large language models run faster and more efficiently than Nvidia GPUs, which target training models. Groq\u2019s last capital raise came in August 2024, when it raised $640 million from companies including BlackRock (BLK) and Cisco (CSCO). The company\u2019s valuation at the time stood at $2.8 billion, a fraction of Nvidia\u2019s more than $3 trillion market cap. It currently clocks in at $3.5 billion,according to Yahoo Finance private markets data. Ross was part of the high-profile tech leader delegation that included Huang, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk and joined President Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia. Ross was able to secure $1.5 billion from Saudi Arabia to expand AI chip delivery to the country. \"They want to become net exporters of intelligence the way that they are net exporters of energy at the moment,\" Ross said of the deal with Saudi Arabia.

After the bell Thursday, the apparel seller reported $1.09 billion in revenue, in line with Visible Alpha estimates and its preliminary resultsreleased earlier this month. The company lost an adjusted $0.29 per share, compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.34 in the same quarter a year ago and a larger loss than analysts had forecast. Comparable sales declined by 3% in the quarter, larger than the 2.13% drop analysts had forecast, as sales declined across both the American Eagle and Aerie brands. \"As we noted in our preliminary release, the first quarter was a challenging period for our business,\" CEO Jay Schottenstein said. \"While we are disappointed with the results, we are taking actions to better position the company and drive stronger performance in the upcoming quarters.\" Earlier this month, American Eagle pulled its full-year outlook as the retailerwrote downsome of its spring and summer inventory as it had more promotional events than expected in the quarter. The company said it was reviewing its plans amid macro uncertainty and the disappointing first quarter. For the second quarter, American Eagle expects revenue to decline by 5% year-over-year as comparable sales fall by 3%, in line with analyst estimates.Last quarter, the companytopped sales estimates but noted that it was seeing cautious consumers start to slow their spending.

        "content": "Japan\u2019sNikkei 225stock market index did something many investors thought improbable: It finally surpassed the late-1980s peak reached during the country's massive asset bubble. Though it has since retreated, some analysts predict big gains again in 2025. Most of those predictions came before Trump announced a flurry of tariffs, including on Japanese exports. However, Japanese shares still trade at a meaningful discount when compared to the S&P \u202f500, even as profit margins and dividends improve.For U.S. investors looking to diversify,Japanese equities may finally deserve a closer look. Japan\u2019s so-called \u201clost decades\u201d after 1990 scarred an entire generation of investors, but the narrative seems to have quietly shifted. Reforms that began in 2010\u2019s \u201cAbenomics\u201d era\u2014lower corporate taxes, arevamped stewardship code, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2019s ongoing campaign to shame chronically low\u2011return companies\u2014appear to be bearing fruit. Shareholder dissent in board elections is at record levels, forcing managers to focus on profits and payouts. Even after the gains of recent years, the index trades around 15\u201316 times forward earnings, versus 25x-30x for the S&P\u202f500.Dividend yieldshover near 2%\u2014low in absolute terms but a sea change for historically stingy Japan. Tariffs, policy shifts, and slowing growth could offset Japan\u2019s tailwinds. Trump\u2019s trade plan, which includes a24% car levy and a 10% blanket tariffon Japanese exports, threatens margins, with automakers warning that billions in profits are at risk. The tariff standoff also filters into Bank of Japan deliberations, with policymakers split on whether U.S.protectionismwill force rate hikes, risking\u00a0a stronger yen and higher domestic costs.Japan\u2019s GDP unexpectedly contracted 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, before the tariff hit, thanks to softer exports and stubbornly weak real wages.A prolonged trade spat could deepen that slowdown, especially if consumer sentiment weakens. Owning unhedged Japan funds gives youcurrency risk exposure:if the yen falls, stock gains may be offset when translated back to dollars. Hedged ETFs solve that, but they\u2019ll underperform if the yen rebounds. A 50/50 split between hedged and unhedged is a common compromise. After decades of disappointment, Japanese equities are enjoying a revival driven by shareholder\u2011friendly reforms, a competitive currency, and interest from institutional investors. Valuations remain reasonable, and the market adds geographic, sectoral, and currency diversification to a U.S.\u2011heavy portfolio\u2014although tariffs could put a damper on things. Japan may never be \u201ccheap\u201d again, but it still looks early in a story that is finally getting interesting.",

        "content": "Morning fellas, I'm back after more than three years to bring you my highest conviction idea ever. I'm talking 90%+ downside.  **TL;DR:**\u00a0Quantum computing stocks are the next great meme bubble \u2014 a flaming clown car of hype, government grants, and zero actual business. Companies like $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI, and especially $QUBT (which literally used to sell flavored beverages) are pretending to be tech plays while burning through cash with nothing to show for it. Even if quantum computing becomes real, Google and IBM already won the arms race. Experts say useful quantum is still 20\u201330 years away \u2014 not 3. This is\u00a0*The Big Short 2: Quantum Boogaloo*. I\u2019m shorting these frauds before they drop another 90%. Strap in.  **Introduction:**  Quantum stocks ripped aggressively since the beginning of the year, after the announcement of Willow, Google's new quantum processor. First of all, Google didn't even come up with anything groundbreaking. Ironically, this also highlights how far ahead Google is from the competition. Even worse, some of the stocks below don't even make quantum computers at all.  Quantum computing is 20-30y+ away, if at all. Yet the stocks trade like they cured cancer yesterday. This is honestly a lot worse than Nikola and EV stocks for those who were there back then. They are totally misunderstood by retail, and some of them literaly have 90%+ downside.  **Quantum Computing Basics:**  Quantum computing isn't a better computer. It's a compeltely different paradigm that is only useful to solve very specific and esoteric problems. Like factoring big prime numbers (even that doesn't even work yet) or doing weird matrix math\u00a0*only under certain condtions.*  To run these algorithms, you don't need just a couple qubits, you need error corrected logical qubits, which take\u00a0*thousands*\u00a0of physicals qubits. We're barely  One of the biggest issues with quantum computeers is gate fidelity. This measures how a quantum gate actually performs its intended operation compared to an ideal, noise-free version of that gate. Today, even the best systems get around 99.9% fiedlity under perfect lab conditions. This sounds high, but due to the exponential scaling of quantum algorithms, erors compoound extremely quickly and at 99.9% they are literaly useless. Quantum algos need billions of error free operations and we're nowhere closes. For comparisons, classical computers have gate fidelity of between 10^(-15)\u00a0and 10^(-18). Thats eighteen 9s after 99, or 99.99999999999999999%. Its not that quantum computers are behind classical computers -\u00a0*they're basically unusable*  **Industry Experts**  Why should you believe me when I say quantum computing doens't work? After all I'm just a muppet. If you don't take my word for it, listen to the leading industry experts, that spend their days working on it.  Scott Aaronson (Professor, UT Austin, top quanutm complexity theorist):   \"We're nowhere near large-scale quantum computers. The real applications are speculative and still a long way off\"  Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA):   \"Quantum computing is decades away. It will not replace classical computing. It's a different tool for very specific problems.\"  Dr. Isaac Chuang (MIT, pionner in quantum information):   \"Quantum computers are not yet practical, and may not be for a long time. The barriers are fundamental\"  Even if all these people are wrong, Google and IBM are so far ahead, that they'll be the clear winners.  **The Trade:**  The most overvalued and ridiculous names are: $QUBT, $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI. I'm short only the first two. They're all ridiculous, but at least IONQ and Rigetti have somewhat of a product.  $QUBT: This is literaly a scam, they've got very little to do with Quantum. These guys were literaly a beverage company. They don't build quantum computers. They sell vague \"quantum inspired\" software with 0 commerical traction. They claim to be \"hardware-agnostic\", which literaly reads \"we don't have a machine\". Imagine being a quantum computing stock with no computer. Revenue in 23 was $100k, not millions, $100k. This is not even a real business, just a vehicule made to earn a quick buck. Their software doens't even require a qaumtum processor to run, it's just classical code with buzzwords. This is my highest conviction short.  $QBTS: These guys make quantum annealers, not even a real quantum computer. They've een in business for 25 years, and only make $9m in revenue, with a market cap of $4.7bn. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, trading for $1, with no cash left. Then the Willow anouncement came and they manage to issue some stock and get some cash back. As a reminder, Willow has nothing to do with QBTS, this will end going back to 0 after the hype subsides.    **Positions:**  Short shares and puts  https://preview.redd.it/3lvx60xuax3f1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f523c7bd92d1368822272e88ec874f0d69b5b1f    Godspeed lads",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)saw its stock momentum rechargeThursday after a flurry of Wall Street upgrades followed strong quarterly results and upbeat guidance. The chipmaker posted revenue of $44.06 billion for the April quarter, a 69% jump from a year earlier and ahead of the $43.34 billion forecast. Earnings per share reached $0.81, comfortably beating the $0.73 consensus. The company said July quarter revenue could come in as high as $45.90 billion, suggesting 50% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. That outlook, paired with rising AI demand, prompted Summit Insights to upgrade the stock to Buy from Holdsurprising some observers, given the firm had missed Nvidias 24% run-up leading into earnings. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Nvidias data center segment once again did the heavy lifting, accounting for 89% of revenue and surging 73% year over year. Gaming and AI PC sales rose 42% to $3.8 billion, while smaller businesses like automotive and visualization added $1.1 billion combined. The mix shows Nvidia is still leaning hard into enterprise AI, but its not ignoring other growth channels. Gross margin slipped to 71.3% after a $4.5 billion charge related to restricted H20 chip sales into China, but management expects margins to bounce back into the mid-70% range as the newer Blackwell architecture scales across more workloads. The companys upbeat forecast comes despite pressure from U.S. export controls, which Nvidia says could cost it up to $8 billion in China data center revenue this quarter. Its still exploring compliant options to serve that market, which it believes could grow to nearly $50 billion. In the meantime, analysts are tuning in for more signals at several upcoming events, including presentations at the BofA Global Tech Conference on June 4 and the NASDAQ Investor Conference on June 10.

        "content": "A temporary deal spurred optimism that the U.S. and China could reach a trade agreement before their trade war caused too much economic damage. On Friday, that outlook didn't seem so bright. President Donald Trump posted on the social media website Truth Social that China has \"totally violated its agreement with us.\"The president did not explain in his Friday morning post how China may have infringed on the pact. Moments after Trump's post, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that \"the Chinese are slow-rolling their compliance.\"He said that while China has decreased its tariff rates, it has not removed some of the countermeasures put in place during the trade war, such as putting U.S. companies on blacklists and restricting the flow of \"critical minerals.\" The trade deal in question was reached in early May. It reduced tariffs from both countries, which had beenratcheted up so highduring a tit-for-tat that economists said it effectively banned trade between the two. The dealreduced U.S. tariffs on Chinato 30% and Chinese import taxes on U.S goods to 10%. However, the deal was only a temporary truce while the countries negotiated a longer-term agreement. The pair has 90 days to do so before mutual tariffs of more than 100% are reinstated. Those longer-termtalks have \"stalled,\"according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday. Bessent said that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will likely need to discuss the trade deal before an agreement can be reached. Another wrinkle to the discussions is the legal case against Trump's tariffs. On Wednesday night, a U.S. trade court ruled that the Trump administrationdoes not have the authorityto enforce tariffs related to fentanyl. Only 10% of the tariffs currently being charged on Chinese goods would be enforceable under that ruling. However, on Thursday, an appeals court granted the Trump administration a temporary reprieve and isallowing all tariffs to be implementedwhile the case works its way through court. What the late-week tumult means for the future of Chinese tariffs is unclear. Stocks opened lower after Trump's social media post, which did not give an optimistic view of future talks. \"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY,\" he wrote.",

Doudna will pair Nvidia's latest Vera Rubin chips with Dell's liquid-cooled servers to support roughly 11,000 researchers nationwide. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The system is designed to merge simulation, data, and artificial intelligence on a single platform, enabling scientists to stream data and receive real-time insights. It aims to accelerate work in fusion energy, materials science, drug discovery, space data processing and quantum workflows. Officials say Doudna will deliver about ten times the output of its predecessor, Perlmutter, while consuming only two to three times more power. Nvidia's role underscores its importance to U.S. science initiatives amid ongoing export restrictions to China.

        "content": "So-calledbond vigilantes have returnedand they might end up reshaping American retirement portfolios. What brought them back? The sustained return of higher levels of inflation and the U.S. government's increasingly rapid accumulation of debt. With more debt likelyon the way, 30-yearTreasury yieldshave poked above 5% to the highest level since 2023. These market forces could already be altering how you save for retirement over the next decade. It's not a good time to beholding or buying low-yielding Treasurys. Inflation is still elevated and may be reignited by President Trump's tariffs, as well as Trump's tax and spending bill, which if passed is expected to increase government debt and fuel inflation. So investors are selling lower-yielding U.S. Treasurys and demanding higher yields on new ones. It's a logical reaction to higher inflation, interest rates, and government debt. Investors want to be sure their returns outpace inflation. Some refer to them as 'bond vigilantes' because their actions drive yields up, making government borrowing more expensive. \"I coined the phrase 'bond vigilantes' way back in the early 80s and they're back and it's a concern,\" Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told theInvestopedia Expresspodcast. If yields go significantly higher from here, it'll be a problem for the government, Yardeni said. \"If we start to see [yields] going above 5% to 6%, everybody will be talking about adebt crisis,\" Yardeni said, since it would massively increase the cost of America's long-term debt. Critics like economistPaul Krugmanhave long argued that any \"vigilante\" action is a myth and that higher yields are simply a rational market response to changing economic conditions. These developments could have an immediateimpact on your retirement savings: For current retirees: New bond purchases and, eventually, certificates of deposits would offer higher income potential\u2014great news if you're looking togenerate steady retirement income. However, there's no guarantee these will outpace inflation that's strong enough to continue driving yields higher. However, the value of the bonds you already hold in your retirement portfolios could take a beating. Bond prices move inversely to yields, so as rates rise, the value of existing bonds with lower rates falls. This also affects you if you're in atarget-date fundor a balanced portfolio that many retirees rely on for stability. But if you're holding bonds strictly for the fixed income, and plan to keep them until maturity, this won't affect you as much. Pre-retirees: Things will be tricker for anyone still building a retirement portfolio. If Treasury yields keep climbing, atraditional 60/40 stocks-to-bonds mixwould leave you exposed to falling bond values. Pre-retirees might consider focusing on shorter-duration bonds or increasing cash holdings\u2014ideally in a high-yield savings or money market account, both of which might still lag Treasurys and inflation. Once yields stabilize at higher levels, consider shifting to longer-term bonds to lock in better longer-term returns. Here are some ways to adjust should rates continue surging: Understanding the impact of surging bond yields can help you better plan for your retirement. The key is recognizing thattraditional retirement planning assumptions, like gradually shifting from stocks to bonds as you age\u2014may need updating.",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic for more than two years now. A small group of tech giants has emerged as leaders in this space, providing either the computing hardware or the user-friendly services that power this technology revolution. You know them as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. This phrase suggests greatness, thoughit was always meant as a warning signal. Several of the seven heroes died in the 1960 movie by the same name. The seven original AI leaders could stumble and fall, too. As I'm writing this on May 28, the Magnificent Seven stocks have separated into two distinct groups. High-performance microchip designerNvidia(NVDA-2.85%)stole the show so far with a total gain of 701% in the ChatGPT-inspiredgenerative AIboom. Software and services giantAlphabet(GOOG0.06%)(GOOGL-0.01%)has a more modest stock return of 72% over the same period. There are so many questions in the air. Can Nvidia hold on to its dominant grip on the AI hardware opportunity? Will Alphabet's Google division thrive in the new age of AI-driven online services? Are the stocks trading at reasonable valuations these days? And most of all -- which one of these mighty AI stocks is the better buy today? Let's take a look. At first glance, Nvidia's stock looks too hot to handle. The stock price has multiplied by 8 in about 30 months. Nvidia's business may be booming, but those shares are changing hands at the lofty valuation of 25 times sales and 54 times free cash flows. Many investors will look no further, walking away from these deal-breakingvaluation multiples. At the same time, lots of investors absolutely love Nvidia's stock at these prices. It comes with one of the lowest short-seller interests on the market. An overwhelming majority of analysts tracking this stock call it a \"buy\" and the average one-year price target is about 24% above the current value. And the Nvidia bulls have their reasons. The company's sales more than doubled in 2023, doubled again in 2024, and are poised to continue soaring as the generative AI market evolves. Furthermore, Nvidia can charge very high prices for its AI accelerator chips and be more limited by manufacturing capacity than by customer demand. As such, Nvidia's profits have skyrocketed much faster than the plain top-line sales. So if you expect Nvidia to stay on its AI hardware throne throughout the mega-growth portion of this generative AI revolution, the stock could definitely be a good buy today. It's not every investor's favorite cup of wealth-building tea, but Nvidia's stock appeals to a certain type of growth-oriented stock buyer. Here's a fun fact. Alphabet makes more money than Nvidia, even after the chip guru's massive growth spurt. The Google parent's annual revenues are about three times the size of Nvidia's. The difference grows smaller when you look at different types of profit, but Alphabet is still consistently larger:  GOOGL Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts Now, Alphabet's huge financial figures are paired with significantly slower growth rates. Hence, the stock doesn't come with growth-inspired price premiums. Trading at 5.9 times sales and 28 times free cash flows, Alphabet's ratios are in the same ballpark as the averageS&P 500(^GSPC-0.01%)component. That makes Alphabet a value-oriented bet on the generative AI boom. It's also a solid long-term holding, with or without the AI-focused opportunity. This company was built to thrive in pretty much any economy. The Google-based Alphabet you see today could look very different 10 or 20 years from now, but it should still be an innovative winner. Image source: Getty Images. I don't want to throw Nvidia under Wall Street's heaviest bus. The company just might be able to stave off AI chip rivals for years to come, until the ballooning valuation finally makes sense. I'm certainly not closing out my own Nvidia position today, hoping to catch a bit more of its AI-driven gains. But I'm not buying more Nvidia stock today, either. Alphabet is a much more tempting idea, pairingthe company's ultimate longevitywith a very reasonable share price. It's one of my favorite investments of all time, and a particularly strong buy at today's modest valuation.",

        "content": "May 30 -Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) shares slid nearly3%to $39.7 on Friday afternoon, falling 57% back from a 52-week high of $101.40 amid broader tech sector pressure. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. Despite trade-tariff uncertainties, SMCI finds support in itslink to NVIDIA(NASDAQ:NVDA) and the rising demand for Blackwell chips. As NVDA's new AI solutions gain traction, data centers require advanced servers and cooling, areas where SMCI specializes. SMCI recently shook off past accounting concerns by installing a new auditing team, helping to restore investor confidence. That groundwork set the stage for a major win: the Saudi government tapped SMCI to build AI-focused data centers, signaling faith in its Foundry servers. NVDA's strong quarterly results have left a gap in data-center maintenance, precisely the niche SMCI can fill. With NVDA's Blackwell chips fueling orders, SMCI may see further upside as AI infrastructure spending climbs. For bulls, SMCI's role in supporting NVDA's Blackwell ecosystem offers a clear catalyst, even as tariffs and macro headwinds persist. Based on the one year price targets offered by 15 analysts, the average target price for Super Micro Computer Inc is $40.00 with a high estimate of $70.00 and a low estimate of $15.00. The average target implies a upside of +0.68% from the current price of $39.73. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Super Micro Computer Inc in one year is $67.82, suggesting a upside of +70.72% from the current price of $39.73.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Applied Materials (AMAT) also lost ground, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropping about 3%.

President Trump on Friday said China has \"totally violated its agreement with us,\" dampening hopes the countries would soon come to a longer-term agreement after reaching a temporary truce earlier this month. Separately,Bloombergreported Friday that Trump plans to expand U.S. companies' licensing requirements to make deals with Chinese companies that have ties to sanctioned firms. The development comes after the Trump administration moved earlier this month torescind the Biden-era AI diffusion rulethat would have further curbed sales of American AI hardware to a broader group of countries, but warned it's looking to replace the rule with new restrictions. Analysts at Citi and Deutsche Bank warned at the time that they could turn out to be stricter than Biden's. During Nvidia'searnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said it's \"terrific\" that Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule, but criticized the administration's other moves to limit its sales to China, saying that \"shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position.\" The AI chipmaker took a $4.5 billion charge in its fiscal first quarter associated with new export curbs on the company's H20 chips to China, and said it expects to take an $8 billion hit in the current quarter due to lost revenue.",

The company behind brands including Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athletica and its namesake label said baseline import dutiescould dent operating incomeby between $100 million and $150 million this year. Leading into the company\u2019s earnings report, Gap shares had rallied 65% from their early-April low and gained 18% since the start of the year, boosted by the retailer\u2019s recent efforts toreinvigorate its brands and drive sales growth.

Since bottoming out in early April, Gap shares havetrendedsharply higher, reclaiming both the 50- and 200-daymoving averagesalong the way. More recently, however, the stock ran into selling pressure near prominent peaks that formed on the chart in March and June last year. Interestingly, the drop occurred on increasingtrading volume, indicating that some larger market participantslocked in profitsahead of the retailer\u2019s quarterly results. Selling accelerated Friday, pushing therelative strength index (RSI)belowoverboughtterritory for the first time since mid May. Let\u2019s identifysupport levelson Gap\u2019s chart worth watching and point out a major overhead area to monitor during future recovery efforts. Coming into today's session, $25 was a key support level to monitor, but that was quickly breached and bulls haven't been able to defend it. The next level to watch is around $22. This area provides aconfluenceof support near the key moving averages and a horizontal line that connects multiplepeaks and troughson the chart extending back to December 2023. A deepercorrectionin the stock could bring lower support at $19 into play. Investors may seek toaccumulate sharesat this location near a trendline that links a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart between January last year and April this year. During recovery efforts, investors should keep a close eye on the $29 level.

        "content": "Trashingactively managed fundshas been one of the biggest trends in financial markets over the past decade. Stacks of evidence proved that blindly buying the whole market delivered better returns than paying an expert to pick the winners, leading to massive inflows intoindex fundsand outflows from their active counterparts. Now the tide may be turning again, at least in the popularexchange-traded fund(ETF) space. Thirty percent of the money plowed into U.S. ETFs so far in 2025 was invested in ETFs managed by professional stock and bond pickers, according to data from Trackinsight. Considering active ETFs make up less than 10% of the market by assets, that\u2019s a large chunk. Similar findings were presented elsewhere. ETF Action, for example, \u00a0revealed that 34% of the money allocated to ETFs in the year to April 25 was foractively managed ETFs, and that recent trends point to investors dumping passive ETFs and active ETFs rising in popularity. This data has gotasset managershopeful that funds run by stock pickers are staging a comeback. Wall Street has longmade a fortune from active funds. The selling point has always been striving to do better than average and having your money handled by the pros. Underperformance has overshadowed that message, but recent developments are helping this often criticized segment of the market get some positive PR. Active ETF product launches, including the conversion of popularmutual fundsinto ETFs, is giving the industry a much-needed facelift and attracting inflows from fans on both sides of the fence. ETFs generally carrylower fees than traditional active fundsand offer greater liquidity as they trade throughout the day. It\u2019s been a volatile year for financial markets and volatility tends to create more opportunities for active managers to outperform. Many indexes are top-heavy. When you invest in a passive ETF, you have a lot riding on the performance of just a handful of really big tech stocks, many of which, after years of outperformance, are looking overvalued. The surge in inflows into active funds being fueled byretail investors, and younger investors who have embraced the market in recent years\u2014Robinhood-type of market players\u2014have demonstrated that they're more aggressive, seeking not just steady returns but market-beating gains. The idea of investing your capital in the entire market without somebody watching over your money is a scary prospect. However, for most people, it\u2019s the best option. Numerous studies indicate that investing in apassive index fundrather than picking stocks in an attempt to beat the market delivers greater returns over the long term, especially when factoring in fees. According to the latest annual SPIVA scorecard, last year, 65% of mutual funds invested in large U.S. companies fell short of their minimum target of beating the S&P 500, the most popular index in the passive ETF space. And that wasn\u2019t down to one bad year. Since S&P 500 started collecting the data 24 years ago, the annual average is that 64% of funds underperformed the index. Wall Street has a lot of money riding on active funds restoring their reputation, and recent developments have worked in its favor. The concept of getting a pro to manage money still has many selling points, and the recent launches of ETFs managed by professional stock and bond pickers add to that, as do market volatility and concerns about the valuation of the big tech stocks. However, it's unlikely that the recent inflows represent a turning point in the long-debated active vs. passive battle. The biggest trump card is evidence ofconsistently delivering superior returns, and passive investing has that in spades.",

There were good reasons for both days' moves. Image source: Getty Images. Theadvanced semiconductor chipand artificial intelligence (AI) software company exceeded expectations for fiscal Q1 sales with a record $44.1 billion in revenue. The results had a bit of an asterisk, though. Restrictions on exports of its H20 chip into China led it to take a $4.5 billion charge in the quarter. China is a meaningful market for Nvidia as sales represented 13% of total revenue last year. The company is planning for more lost sales, too.Fiscal Q2guidance included the loss of another $8 billion in H20 sales. Yet management still thinks record quarterly earnings are likely in the current quarter. With the business humming on all cylinders other than in China, investors got excited to jump into the stock yesterday. But China played a big role in today's stock decline too. President Trump indicated that trade tensions were reaccelerating as he claimed China violated agreements made earlier this month in Geneva. In the quarterly call for investors, CEO Jensen Huang noted the impact a loss of the China market represented. He stated, \"Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry. The H20 exportban ended our Hopper Data Center business in China.\" With tensions flaring up again this morning, investors might be thinking that the market may not be opening back up any time soon.

        "content": "A number of companies have made commitments to invest in domestic infrastructure over the next several years. Chief among these initiatives is ajoint ventureamongOracle,SoftBank, and OpenAI. Known as Stargate, this consortium of technology leaders plans to invest $500 billion into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the U.S. Just last week, investors finally got an update on how Stargate is progressing. In perhaps a shock to absolutely no one, semiconductor powerhouseNvidia(NVDA-2.85%)is involved with a new data center for OpenAI. Let's dig into this deal and assess why it could be a game changer for Nvidia. As a refresher, OpenAI burst onto the AI scene a few years ago following a multibillion-dollar investment fromMicrosoft. While OpenAI's services, chief among them ChatGPT, have become heavily integrated throughout Microsoft's ecosystem, both companies have been seeking opportunities to branch out over the last year or so. For OpenAI, the company has reached a point whereby striking partnerships with other technology companies is essential -- hence the creation of Stargate. The reason for this is that as demand for ChatGPT grows, so does the need for compute power (i.e., more data center infrastructure). However, Microsoft simply cannot be the sole bridge to finance OpenAI's needs. Per recent reports, Oracle is planning to purchase an estimated 400,000 graphics processing units (GPU) from Nvidia for OpenAI's new data center in Texas. Of note, the GPUs are Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture and could cost Oracle up to $40 billion. Oracle will subsequently be leasing these chips to OpenAI as part of the deal structure, adding even more tailwinds to its fast-growinginfrastructure-as-a-service(IaaS) division. Image source: Getty Images. I see two primary reasons why this deal is a game changer for Nvidia. First, global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company recently published a report in which it estimates nearly$7 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructureover the next five years. Within this grand total, McKinsey believes that hardware providers will be the biggest beneficiaries of rising AI capital expenditure (capex). Even though Stargate is still in its infancy, there are signs that hardware suppliers such as Nvidia are already benefiting from increased AI infrastructure budgets. Reports suggest that OpenAI is considering building more data centers beyond Texas. Given Nvidia's selection to lead this initial buildout, I'm optimistic the company could continue winning more contracts from the Stargate project -- hence, this could be the beginning of a long-term relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia. On top of that, it was reported earlier this year thatOpenAI was collaboratingwithTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingto develop its own custom chipsets. While OpenAI may indeed eventually pursue custom silicon, it appears for now that the company's compute power relies heavily on data centers outfitted with Nvidia's GPUs. To me, this signals that demand for Blackwell continues to remain robust. Moreover, Nvidia's selection as a primary chip supplier for one of Stargate's initial projects underscores just how critical the company's hardware is for ongoing AI development. For the first time in almost three years, Nvidia stock has actually taken a breather -- and a prolonged one at that.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Investors have been selling Nvidia stock throughout most of 2025, thanks in large part to uncertainty around new tariff policies and how they may impactNvidia's ability to conduct business in China. Nevertheless, the company'sforward price to earnings(P/E) multiple of 32.6 shows some clear valuation compression in the red-hot chip stock. I see the deal with OpenAI as a potential proxy for what's to come for Nvidia as Stargate and other AI infrastructure deals come to fruition. To me, the company's long-run prospects look as strong as ever -- despite some headwinds in key Asian markets for now. Investors with a long-run time horizon may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia right now, as the stock could witness a sharp rebound if it continues to win over more high-profile deals with AI's biggest developers.",

        "content": "Palantir (PLTR) shares climbed Friday amid optimism about the AI darling's expanding work for the U.S. government. The stock jumped nearly 8% to close at $131.78, making it one of the day\u2019s best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. The stock has surged nearly 75% this year, leading the Nasdaq 100's constituents so far in 2025. Palantir\u2019s gains have come as its work for the federal government has grown in recent months. The government has integrated a Palantir product called Foundry into at least four agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department, TheNew York Timesreported Friday. Officials at theSocial Security AdministrationandInternal Revenue Servicehave also had discussions with Palantir about buying its technology, the report said.\u00a0Palantir did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the SSA or IRS. Earlier this week,Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage backer, announced the launch of an AI-powered crime detection unit in partnership with Palantir.Fannie Mae claimed the unit would help prevent millions of dollars in fraud losses by helping detect fraud \u201cwith speed and precision never before seen in the U.S. housing market.\u201d This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent share price values.",
