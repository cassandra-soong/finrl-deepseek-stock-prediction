        "content": "Cisco Systems (CSCO) is slated to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market closes Wednesday, with earnings and revenue expected to tick up somewhat from a year earlier. Analysts on average expect Cisco to report quarterly revenue of $14.06 billion, up more than 10%year-over-year, and adjusted net income of $3.66 billion, or 92 cents per share, up from $3.55 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Of the 10 analysts following Cisco who are tracked by Visible Alpha, three have a \u201cbuy\u201d rating for the networking-equipment provider\u2019s stock, and seven maintain \u201chold\u201dratings. Their consensus price target near $67 would suggest 12% upside from the stock\u2019s closing price Friday. Shares of Cisco have gained about 2% in 2025. Analysts will also be watching Cisco\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure orders. In February, the company said second-quarter AI ordersexceeded $350 million, bringing its total to roughly $700 million for the first half of thefiscal year. Analysts could also ask Cisco about the quantum computing chip it unveiled last week, which the company claims \u201ccould accelerate impactful quantum computing and networking applications from decades away to just 5-10 years.\u201d",

But investors will also be evaluating the outcome of theweekend meetings between U.S. and Chinese trade officialsafter a quiet Friday session that left stocksdown for the week. Traders will also follow Thursday's remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as he comes underpressure from President Donald Trumpover theFed's interest rate policy. And retail sales data will be closely watched on Thursday, the same day as retailer Walmart (WMT) reports earnings. Earnings releases from Cisco Systems (CSCO), Alibaba Group (BABA), Deere & Co. (DE), Applied Materials (AMAT), and video game maker Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are among the week's other top scheduled results. Consumer and small business sentiment surveys, along with homebuilder and manufacturing sector data, could also attract attention. Monday, May 12 Tuesday, May 13 Wednesday, May 14 Thursday, May 15 Friday, May 16 The weekend meetings on trade between U.S. and Chinese officials are likely to capture market watchers\u2019 attention to start the week, with investors hopeful that trade tensions between the two nations could be easing. Inflation will be in focus as investors get their first look at April prices with the Tuesday release of theConsumer Price Index (CPI). At last week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, officials said they were looking for more improvement on inflation before moving to lower interest rates from their current levels. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Thursday; last week, President Trump was critical of the Fed for failing to act on interest rates.\u00a0Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are among the other officials expected to deliver remarks this week. March\u2019s CPI report indicated that inflationdropped unexpectedly to a rise of 2.4%,\u00a0while other recent indicators haveshown that price increases are slowing. Investors are also expecting updates on import and export prices, as well as April\u2019s Producer Price Index, which shows inflation at the wholesale level. Retail sales data, scheduled for Thursday, comes as consumer spending has been strong while shoppersrush to buy itemsbefore tariffs take hold. Economists are looking for signs of change in spending levels, with recent consumer sentiment surveys showing that feelings about the economy are worsening. On Friday, the latest sentiment report is expected to offer May's first look at how consumers feel about current and future economic conditions. The survey offers insights into spending patterns that can help support the economy. It follows several months ofsurveys showing declining consumer sentimentamid worries over the administration's tariffs' impact on prices. Tuesday\u2019s expected small business sentiment report could further signal the economy\u2019s direction. The homebuilders' confidence survey, scheduled for Thursday, and Friday\u2019s expected housing starts data, will highlight inventory supply trends during a period in which housing scarcity is helpingdrive affordability problems. Investors will also be looking at Thursday\u2019s scheduled industrial productivity report for data on the manufacturing sector. Monday\u2019s planned release of the monthly federal budget for April will provide an update on government debt levels. Walmart\u2019s scheduled quarterly report on Thursday leads the weekly earnings calendar, as market watchers seek information on consumer spending and economic conditions amiduncertain U.S. trade policy. The retail giant reported prior-quarter earnings per share and revenue that came in ahead of analyst expectations, but itsoutlook was weaker than expectedas the company said it was evaluating the impact of tariffs on its business. Cisco is expected to report on Wednesday after the network infrastructure provider posted higher revenue in the prior quarter onincreased AI ordersand approved a $15 billion increase to the company\u2019sstock repurchaseprogram. Semiconductor maker Applied Materials\u2019 report scheduled for Thursday comes after it said in itsprevious quarterly earnings reportin February that sales could be negatively affected by recent limitations on chip exports. Take-Two Interactive\u2019s Thursday earnings report will drop as the video game maker builds excitement for itslatest releasein the Grand Theft Auto game franchise. Deere\u2019s report on the same day will provide a look at the agricultural sector. Nuclear power startup Oklo\u2019s report on Tuesday comes after it recently reported that itslosses widened in 2024. Investors in the power provider include OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, which has raised investor optimism that the company\u2019s services could be used tomeet energy demand for AI infrastructure projects. Investors will also be following scheduled earnings reports from Chinese e-commerce companies Alibaba, JD.com, and Tencent Music Entertainment.",

        "content": "Americans haven\u2019t stopped spending despite broad economic uncertainty. But a close look at recent data and trends has fed concerns about a slowdown. The unemployment rate is relatively low, and job creation isholding steady. Retail spending shot up 6.8% year-over-year in April, the National Retail Federation said, exclusive of car and gas purchases. But Americans are increasingly uneasy, several measures suggest. Consumer sentimentfell in April for a fourth straight month, according to the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Quick-service restaurants and companies selling everything from lunch to laundry detergent say their customers seem squeezed. And while credit and debit card spending ticked up 1% last month, according to Bank of America, there was a pullback in big splurges like trips and hotels. Two releases set for Thursday will offer fresh data: Walmart (WMT) is slated to hand in its first-quarter numbers, and the government is scheduled to publish April retail data.Trade negotiations, notably with China, ahve contributed to the uncertainty: Widespread \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs are notslated to take effect for weeks, but the NRFthinks the threat of higher import taxes has spurred consumers to stock up on some items, juicing retail spending in April. \u201cThere\u2019s a real inconsistency in the vibe,\u201d said Max Levchin, CEO of buy now, pay later provider Affirm (AFRM), on CNBC Friday.\u201cPeople are stressed out about the economy, yet they\u2019re shopping. They\u2019re buying, and they\u2019re paying their bills.\u201d Oppenheimer analysts on Wednesday said Walmart has historically performed well in recessionary periods. Still, they acknowledged the current outlook can be hard to read. \u201cWe have seen potentially mixed consumer data-points lately with still healthy consumer spending trends overall,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut at the same time, [there has been] more downbeat [consumer packaged goods company] commentary.\u201d Consumers have \u201ca lot to process\u201d and a reason to \u201cpause,\u201d Procter & Gamble (PG) CFO Andre Schulten said last month.

        "header": "Prediction: AMD Could Surge by 111% in the Next 2 Years",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices(AMD1.14%)has been one of the biggest success stories over the last decade in the semiconductor industry. Under the guidance of CEO Lisa Su, the company has reinvented itself after a long history as an also-ran in the industry. It shed its foundry business to become a dynamic fabless chip designer that has steadily grabbed market share fromIntelin the PC market, and it's emerged as a promising maker of artificial intelligence (AI) GPUs in the data center market. Over the last decade, AMD stock is up more than 4,000%, but lately, its fortunes have reversed. Over the last year, the stock declined nearly 40% as AMD's AI business grew slower than investors hoped. However, that sets the stock up for a recovery in the coming years as it now looks cheap, and AMD is executing effectively as its latest earnings report shows. Investors largely shrugged off AMD's first-quarter earnings report. There was some concern that AI growth was getting pushed to the second half of the year as revenue in its data center segment was down sequentially in the first quarter. Let's take a look at the numbers and see what it would take for AMD stock to double in the next two years. Image source: Getty Images. In the first quarter, AMD reported its fastest revenue growth since 2022 when its numbers were juiced by the acquisition of Xilinx. Revenue growth accelerated to 36% in Q1, reaching $7.44 billion, ahead of the consensus at $7.12 billion. Growth was paced by a strong performance in both the data center and client segments. Data center revenue jumped 57% to $3.7 billion, driven by growth in its EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU chips, while client revenue, which includes PCs, rose 68% to $2.3 billion due to strong demand for its Zen 5 AMD Ryzen processor. The company also closed on its acquisition of ZT Systems, a server maker, which it said would help it address a data center AI accelerator market it believed would be worth $500 billion by 2028. Second-quarter guidance was better than expected as the company expects revenue around $7.4 billion, which includes $1.5 billion in lost revenue due to new export restrictions on certain AI chips intended for China. That compared to the consensus at $7.24 billion and represents 27% growth from the quarter a year ago. Nvidiadominates the market for data center GPUs, and that's unlikely to change. However, it's beneficial to a number of industry players, including GPU buyers, for Nvidia to have some competition, and AMD is the closest alternative right now.\u00a0That puts the company in an advantageous position. In the first-quarter report, the chipmaker saidOraclewould deploy a large-scale cluster powered by MI355x accelerators and 5th Gen EPYC processors later this year.\u00a0 AndAmazonjust disclosed a first-quarter purchase of 822,234 AMD shares, indicating a deepening partnership between the two companies as Amazon already uses AMD chips for a number of its products. AMD should continue to benefit from tailwinds in AI and the data center segment. Even a recession is unlikely to significantly delay investment in the cutting-edge technology as the big hyperscalers and others are racing toartificial general intelligence (AGI). With the upcoming launch of new Instinct accelerators like the MI350 and MI400 and its recent results, AMD is showing that it will be a player in this market, even if it lags significantly behind Nvidia. Additionally, AMD looks well positioned to continue grabbing market share from Intel in the client segment, as Intel is still significantly larger than AMD, but reported an 8% decline in the client segment to $7.6 billion. With layoffs expected and Intel's focus on rolling out its 18A process at Intel Foundry, returning the client segment to growth doesn't seem to be its biggest priority right now. Finally, AMD stock looks surprisingly affordable given the accelerating revenue growth and the upcoming launch of several new accelerators. The stock trades at aforward P/Eof 26, and based on 2026 estimates, it trades at a P/E of just 17. If its recent momentum continues, those estimates are likely to move higher, which should drive the stock price higher as well. At that valuation and with its growth momentum, gaining 111% over the next two years to return to its all-time high at $211.38 seems within reach. Investors will learn more at the company's \"Advancing AI\" day in June, but the future continues to look bright for AMD. Keep an eye on the performance and the launch of its new AI accelerators later this year.",

        "header": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Palantir vs. Nvidia",
        "content": "Many artificial intelligence (AI) companies experienced surging growth over the past few years, and two of the most popular have beenPalantir Technologies(PLTR-1.49%)andNvidia(NVDA-0.62%). Palantir's stock is up more than 1,160% over the past three years, and Nvidia's has spiked 532%. But with tariffs and economic uncertainty, even AI stocks have stumbled a bit lately. In light of the recent market volatility, let's take a look at which of these two companies looks like the betterAI stockright now. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidiamakes the processors that are central to most of the world's AI data centers. The company's semiconductors have an estimated 75% to 95% of the AI accelerator market, and these superior processors have been the company's financial springboard. Nvidia's sales rose 78% year over year to $39.3 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, and earnings per share spiked 82% to $0.89. Many tech companies are investing large sums of money to build out AI data centers -- includingMicrosoft,Alphabet,Meta Platforms,Apple, and others -- spending hundreds of billions of dollars collectively. The spending spree won't last forever, of course, but no one really knows when it'll stop. Some companies have slowed their data center investments, while others continue to ramp up. But one thing that's very clear right now is that no tech company wants to fall behind in AI. Training new AI models usually includes using the most advanced chips for training, and Nvidia's are the best. Nvidia plays such a central role in advanced AI right now and has such a lead in this space that it's very difficult for any of the company's competitors to catch up to Nvidia's anytime soon. Palantirrecently reported its latest financial results for its first quarter, and it was another impressive one for the company. Revenue jumped 39% year over year to $884 million, and Palantir's earningsdoubledto $0.08 per share. Palantir CEO Alexander Karp said his company is \"in the middle of a tectonic shift in the adoption of our software\" that's leading to strong growth. Management raised its full-year guidance, with sales expected to be about $3.9 billion, up from its previous guidance of $3.75 billion. Palantir makes its money selling AI-powered analytics software both to the government and other companies. Most of its business comes from the U.S. government, with 42% of total revenue from these contracts in the first quarter. U.S. government sales rose 45% from the year-ago quarter, showing the company's strength in this segment. Both Nvidia and Palantir are growing fast, and they both will likely continue to be good investments over the long term. But I think Nvidia is a better buy right now because its stock is so much cheaper relative to Palantir. Palantir has aforward price-to-earningsmultiple of 196, which is very high by any measure and far more expensive than Nvidia's forward P/E ratio of 26. That doesn't mean Nvidia is cheap, but it certainly looks like a more reasonable valuation than Palantir's. Both Nvidia and Palantir are successful AI companies and growing fast, but Palantir's valuation is simply too high to justify paying for. That makes Nvidia's stock much more attractive if you're looking for a great artificial intelligence play.",

        "content": "There's no question that artificial intelligence (AI) has real use cases and that the latest AI models can do some incredible things. But it's important to remember that the technology has limitations. Ultimately, all an AI model does is predict the next token -- characters of text, pixels in an image, and so forth -- in a stream of tokens. There's no real reasoning or thinking, just a bunch of statistics. Because of these limitations, AI models often get things wrong or create false information. It's not surprising, then, that businesses are struggling to make AI investments work.International Business Machines(IBM-1.32%)recently conducted a survey of 2,000 CEOs around the world, and the main takeaway paints a rough picture for companies likeNvidia(NVDA-0.62%)that are all-in on AI. Image source: Getty Images. According to IBM's survey, just 25% of CEOs said AI initiatives have delivered the expectedreturn on investment (ROI)over the past few years. Worse, only 16% of CEOs report that AI initiatives have been scaled enterprise-wide. AI is still providing value to businesses, although perhaps not as much as originally expected. About 52% of CEOs claim their organization is realizing value from AI investments outside of cost reductions. Around two-thirds of CEOs noted that the risk of falling behind, rather than a clear view of the financial benefits, is driving AI investments right now. While AI technology is struggling to deliver for businesses, CEOs remain optimistic. A full 85% of CEOs expected AI to deliver a positive ROI\u00a0by 2027. Nvidia's growth story hinges on ever-growing demand for more powerful AI accelerators to train and run AI models of increasing complexity and cost. However, with businesses struggling to produce positive returns on investment from AI initiatives, the path to positive ROI almost certainly involves bringing down the cost of AI. That's not a trend that will benefit Nvidia. Nvidia needs to sell many millions of its data center graphics processing units (GPUs), and it needs to sell them for tens of thousands of dollars each to keep growing. While expanding usage of AI can drive demand for GPUs, the track record of businesses making AI investments work suggests that the future of the AI industry involves more efficient AI models capable of running on cheaper hardware. DeepSeek shook the AI industryearlier this year with its inexpensive AI models, and other developments are pointing in the same direction.Microsoftrecently unveiled anew \"1-bit\" AI modelthat can run on a central processing unit (CPU) and uses just 0.4 gigabytes of memory while matching the performance of other AI models in the same size class. In the same vein, earlier this month,IBM previewed its Granite 4.0 Tiny AI modelthat can run on inexpensive consumer-grade GPUs. Cheap AI is good for the AI industry in the sense that it makes the technology more accessible and unlocks use cases that wouldn't work financially if the cost of running an AI model were prohibitive. Companies like IBM that are focused on enterprise AI solutions with clear ROIs benefit from the proliferation of affordable AI, while companies like Nvidia that need AI models to become more power hungry likely won't. While the AI industry is evolving quickly, Nvidia investors should be concerned about businesses' low rate of success in scaling their AI investments and making them work financially.",

        "header": "Stock Splits Revisited: Here's How 3 High-Profile Stocks Have Performed Since Their Splits.",
        "content": "Few things stoke more investor interest than a stock split. While they don't alter any of a stock's fundamentals like revenue, net income, or free cash flow, splits can create buzz around a stock, bolstering existing momentum or reviving its appeal among the investment community. Yet, there is no sure thingwhen it comes tothe stock market, and not all stocks that undergo a split seebigreturns. Here, three Motley Fool contributors will review how three high-profile stocks have performed since their most recent splits:Broadcom(AVGO0.22%),Palo AltoNetworks(PANW-0.89%), andNvidia(NVDA-0.62%). Image source: Getty Images. Jake Lerch(Nvidia):It's been nearly a year since Nvidia completed its most recentstock spliton June 10, 2024. On that date, the company split its shares 10-for-1, granting each existing shareholder 10 shares for every one share they had owned prior to the split. Since then, Nvidia's stock has essentially moved sideways. However, there have been significant ups and downs. The stock has fallen by as much as 22% at its lowest point (a few weeks ago in early April 2025). It's also experienced a few big rallies, most notably during the last few months of 2024, when shares were up by as much as 24%. Yet, there is a lesson to be gleaned from this meandering price action: Stock prices and fundamentals don't always move inlockstep. Indeed, Nvidia's fundamentals have soared compared to one year ago: In short, the company is posting excellent results, highlighting Nvidia's predominant role within the boomingartificial intelligence (AI)sector. Thanks to those fantastic EPS figures, Nvidia stock now trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) multipleof 40x. While that's still high for the average stock, it's one of the lowest multiples for Nvidia over the last five years. In fact, the average P/E ratio for the stock overthat five-year periodis around 80x.  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts. So, while Nvidia's stock performance since its most recent stock splitmight appear to bemore of a fizzle than a sizzle, remember, fundamentals tell the true story of a company's performance.On that front, Nvidia remains a solid performer. Will Healy(Broadcom):Another stock to benefit significantly from AI is Broadcom. The semiconductor and software giant became a leader in AI as it applied that technology to hardware and applications that serve businesses. In June 2024, AI-driven gains had taken Broadcom to a pre-split price of around $1,500 per share. That prompted the company to announce its first-ever stock split, splitting its shares on a 10-for-1 basis. When that split occurred on July 15, 2024, the split and the rising stock price led to a price of $169.89 per share. As of this writing, it has made gains of approximately 18% in the 10 months since the split. Despite that increase, the path higher was not smooth. It peaked in early February at an intraday high of $251.88 per share. However, it got caught in a generalized sell-off inAI stocksand lost as much as 45% of its value over the next two months. Fortunately for Broadcom bulls, the stock has trended higher since that time and is now approximately 20% off its 52-week high, leaving it in a bear market. The gains are likely not done yet. Admittedly, the P/E ratio of 97 implies that it is a pricey stock. Nonetheless, a deeper look at its valuation places its forward P/E at 30, which appears inexpensive for a top AI stock, particularly with its growth likely to continue. Analysts forecast that profits will grow by 36% this year. The 2026 prediction calls for 19% earnings growth. While the slowing growth rate could delay the recovery of Broadcom stock in the near term, the falling valuation should bode well for its long-term bull case post-split. Justin Pope(Palo Alto Networks):Cybersecurityis one of the hottest growth themes in the technology sector. Palo Alto Networks, a standout for its firewall security, surged 181% between the start of 2023 and when management announced a 2-for-1 stock split on Nov. 20, 2024. The stock price was approaching $400 at that time. Stock splits lower share prices by increasing the total share count. Splits can make a stock easier to buy or sell for individual investors or employees who may want to cash out shares they've earned. Importantly, the share count increases proportionately, so the valuation, measured by the price-to-earnings ratio,price-to-sales ratio, or any other metric you choose, doesn't change. Still, investors tend to applaud stock splits. Unfortunately, Palo Alto Networks hasn't performed very well following the split. The stock is down by approximately 7% since it began trading at its split-adjusted share price on Dec. 16, 2024. Companies tend to conduct stock splits when things are going well, so why has the stock languished? For starters, the market has become increasingly volatile in recent months amid geopolitical conflicts, recession worries, and a trade war between the United States and China. Plus, Palo Alto Networks had become quite expensive following its nearly two-year run into the end of last year. Shares still trade at a hefty 58 times 2025 earnings estimates, which isn't exactly a bargain for a business that analysts estimate will grow earnings by an average of 19% annually over the long term. Patient investors should do well over the next five-plus years if the company can sustain double-digit growth, but overpaying for stocks can stunt short-term returns. The take-home message? Stock splits should never be the sole reason an investor buys a stock.",

        "content": "Between 2023 and 2024, theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)andNasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)generated total returns of 58% and 87%, respectively. These gains were fueled in large part by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Unfortunately for AI investors, 2025 has been a different story. In April, there was significant panic-selling across growth stocks in particular. Investors are undoubtedly concerned over the various potential outcomes of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. But could these emotions be overblown? I think they could be. Let's explore some recent updates from the AI industry's biggest cast members and why semiconductor kingNvidia(NVDA-0.62%)could see its shares surge after it reports its first-quarter results on May 28. Over the last couple of weeks, numerous companies have reported their Q1 financial results. When it comes to AI, investors ought to pay close attention toMicrosoft,Amazon,Alphabet,Meta Platforms, andAdvanced Micro Devices, all of which are devoting considerable resources to their AI-related pursuits. The trends in their capital expenditures (capex) and revenues can shed some light on broader demand in the AI space and where it might be headed. I know there are some uncertainties as it relates to tariffs and other things. But this is one of those areas where, from an infrastructure standpoint, there continues to be investment in AI infrastructure. And so with that, we would expect strong growth into the second half of the year. Image source: Getty Images. The graph below illustrates Nvidia's stock price over the last three years, with its quarterly report dates marked by the purple circles. Nvidia stock has risen considerably across this period -- but we already knew that.  NVDAdata byYCharts. Yet since Nvidia reported its Q2 2024 earnings in August, the stock has actually dropped by about 9%. In other words, Nvidia hasn't been a moneymaker for your portfolio for a little while now. Even though the stock's performance has been underwhelming for almost a year now, the company's results have been consistently impressive during this time. In my view, the share price movements have been tied more to macroeconomic storylines than to the actual performance of the business. Going back to last summer, some of the bigger narratives influencing the markets included the presidential campaign and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions relating to inflation and interest rates. While none of these things have much to do with AI or Nvidia specifically, the uncertainty surrounding them had an impact on growth stocks. I think big tech's commitment to its infrastructure investments speaks volumes about how robust the hyperscalers expect the AI tailwind to be. Su's remarks underscore this idea, as she expects production of AMD's next-generation chip architecture to begin scaling up significantly in the latter portion of the year. All told, I see these trends as incrediblypositive for Nvidia's own prospects.  NVDA Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts. Moreover, given that analysts' consensus estimates are for Nvidia's revenue and earnings to nearly double over the next two years, I'm confident the company remains well positioned to dominate the AI infrastructure market over the coming years. For these reasons, I think Nvidia stock will soar following its earnings report later this month and I see the stock as a no-brainer buying opportunity right now.",

        "header": "Should You Buy Nvidia Before May 19?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.62%)skyrocketed last year as demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) products and services took off, led by some of the world's biggest tech companies. These players aim to win the AI race and, to do so, need the very best tools to supercharge their platforms. For this, they've turned -- andcontinue to turn-- to Nvidia. But in recent times, despite record earnings and demand for Nvidia products, the stock price has stumbled. This isn't specific to Nvidia. It's happening throughout the market amid concerns about President Donald Trump's move to tax imports. The president announced an initial tariff plan last month, then paused it to negotiate deals with various countries. Meanwhile, Trump exempted electronics products such as AI chips from the tariffs, but this status is temporary. Investors have worried that tariffs may lead to higher prices and therefore hurt companies in two ways: (1) Demand for their products could drop, and (2) their expenses may rise. Nvidia may be well positioned to handle potential tariffs, though. The company recently made a big move to increase production in the U.S., and its $43 billion in cash gives it the financial strength it needs to face potential headwinds. Nvidia has been firing on all cylinders, and we may have a chance to hear more about this top AI company's progress very soon, specifically on May 19. Should you buy the stock before then? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. So, what exactly is happening on this particular day later in the month? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will be giving the keynote at Computex, a major AI conference in Taiwan, on May 19 (the event continues through May 23). The technology showcase will focus on the theme of \"AI Next,\" featuring the categories AI and robotics, next-generation technology, and future mobility. Sessions involving Nvidia and its partners will span the areas of manufacturing, life sciences, and other industries. But investors will particularly have their eyes on Huang's keynote and hope for some updates on the company's latest innovations and upcoming releases. Huang is known for giving exciting presentations packed with company news. For example, during his keynote at GTC in March, he announced the roadmap for upcoming launches, including the Blackwell Ultra chip and the Vera Rubin architecture. Huang said Blackwell Ultra should come later this year, and Rubin will follow in the second half of 2026. It's possible he will offer additional details on these upcoming products at Computex. According to a report in ComputerBase, Nvidia and partnerMediaTekmay announce theirArm Holdings-based processors for PCs.\u00a0This would represent a big step for Nvidia in the area of Windows operating systems running on Arm processor-powered computers. It's also possible Huang will talk about the ongoing Blackwell rollout -- the Blackwell architecture just launched a few months ago -- and the potential for full production of such AI infrastructure in the U.S. As I mentioned,Nvidia recently announcedan investment to boost the manufacturing of its products at home. Any details on what's ahead could spur excitement about Nvidia's next chapter of AI growth and result in gains for the stock. Considering this, should you buy Nvidia before Huang's keynote on May 19? Yes and no. Here's what I mean. You don't absolutely have to rush to get in on Nvidia before that moment if you aim to hold on to the shares for the long term. It's impossible to time the market to get in on a stock at its very lowest and sell at the highest, so it's a waste of time to focus on that sort of strategy. Instead, you're better off buying a stock when it's reasonably priced and holding on for the long term as the company progresses through its growth story. Today, trading at 26xforward earnings estimates, Nvidia is reasonably priced. Even if the stock climbs after a Computex announcement, I wouldn't expect it to land in overvalued territory overnight. All this means it's a great ideato buy Nvidianow -- or after the big AI event later this month.",

        "content": "The stock market may not seem like the friendliest place for investors right now, with the three major benchmarks -- theS&P 500, theDow Jones Industrial Average, and theNasdaq Composite-- down since the start of the year. Worries about President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports havehalted the positive momentumthat carried indexes over the past two years. The concern is that duties will lift prices and weigh on economic growth. Though Trump temporarily halted the tariffs to allow for negotiations with countries and even announced a first deal -- with the U.K. -- we're still early in this process of talks with other nations, so we don't yet know the eventual tariff impact. But here's some good news. For long-term investors, these uncertain times are actuallythe momentto invest. That's because you can buy quality, well-established companies for reasonable, and sometimes even dirt cheap, prices. Let's check out the best stocks to invest $1,000 in now. With this amount or even less, you can get in on all the following, or decide to bet on just one. Image source: Getty Images. It isn't every day that you'll find shares of the top artificial intelligence (AI) chip company at a bargain price. Earlier this year,Nvidia(NVDA-0.62%)stock traded for 50xforward earnings estimates, but after recent stock price declines, the shares are now trading for 26x these estimates. The last time Nvidia was this cheap was about a year ago. So, why should you jump in now? Despite today's economic uncertainty, the AI boom continues. In fact, analysts forecast the AI market will reach $2 trillion in less than 10 years. Nvidia should be the first to benefit as it dominates the AI chip market, and the company's focus on innovation will likely keep it in this leading position. A few months ago, Nvidia successfully rolled out its latest chip architecture, Blackwell, to extraordinary demand and has set out a roadmap of annual releases for the coming two years. This tech giant has generated record levels of revenue -- and at levels of high profitability with gross margin wider than 70%. And Nvidia has $43 billion in cash to support its fast-paced development. All of this makes Nvidia a no-brainer addition to any growth-focused portfolio right now. Target(TGT-0.65%)has suffered in recent years amid tougher times for the consumer, but the company has still grown earnings over the years and has what it takes to keep that long-term growth going. This retailer used the early pandemic period to maximize convenience for shoppers, growing its digital sales and same-day delivery options.  TGT Net Income (Annual)data byYCharts. The company has also invested in store renovations and focused on using its stores to rapidly fulfill digital orders. Target's efforts have resulted in almost $30 billion in sales growth over the past five years. Another element that should set this retail giant up for long-term success is its solid portfolio of owned brands. The company has more than 40, and about a quarter of them are bringing in at least $1 billion in sales annually. These brands are particularly attractive for Target, as the company has complete control over the production and marketing of these goods, keeping costs low and profits high. Target shares have slumped 57% over the past three years. But I see this as a fantastic opportunity to get in on this future winner, especially attoday's valuationof only 10x forward earnings estimates, around its lowest in at least three years. Amazon's(AMZN0.55%)e-commerce and cloud computing businesses are starting to greatly benefit from decisions the company made a few years ago. I'll start with e-commerce. The company revamped its cost structure and shifted to a regional fulfillment model from a national one. This has helped Amazon lower overall costs, and the move to bring products closer to the customer is lowering the cost to serve.\u00a0And Amazon isn't done with this: It's now improving its inbound network -- the system that brings products to fulfillment centers -- and says that should result in further savings. As for cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has invested heavily in AI, which has brought the unit to a $117 billion annual revenuerun rate. AWS, the world's No. 1 cloud provider, offers customers a broad range of AI products and services, from top Nvidia chips to its in-house designed chips for cost-conscious customers. And let's not forget AWS's fully managed AI service, Amazon Bedrock. The e-commerce and cloud businesses have kept growth going steadily at Amazon in recent times. In the latest quarter, net sales, rising 9%, topped $155 billion. Amazon's key decisions should keep that going and favor profitability in the quarters to come. And trading for only 31x forward earnings estimates now, this stock makes a fantastic place to park your $1,000.",
