        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell on Monday to snap a four-day winning streak following news that China'sHuawei Technologies is developing a rival AI chip. The Wall Street Journalreported Monday that the Chinese company hopes the new chip could replace some of Nvidia\u2019s high performance products, adding that it has approached several Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the chip. Nvidia shares are up about 25% from their early-April low but have lost around a fifth of their value since the start of the year as of Monday\u2019s close. In recent months the AI favorite's stock has come under pressure due to concerns over significantlycheaper AI technology coming out of Chinaand a federalcrackdown on the export of the company\u2019s popular H20 chips to China. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify key price levels worth watching out for.

A breakout above the falling wedge pattern\u2019s upper trendline could initially see the shares test the $115 level. This area may provide overhead resistance near the Aprilswing high, a location that also aligns with severalretracementson the chart stretching back to last September. Buying above this area may trigger a move up to around $130. Investors who have bought shares at lower prices could look forexit pointsin this region near last year\u2019s prominent Augustpeakand December trough.

        "header": "Prediction: Palantir Technologies Won't Live Up to the Hype on May 5",
        "content": "Although tariffs have been the talk of Wall Street in recent weeks, the trend that's been captivating the attention of investors for more than two years is the evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI). With AI, software and systems have the capacity to reason and act without the assistance of humans. Additionally, these systems can evolve over time to learn new jobs and skillsets, which further expands the addressable market for this technology. Based on a prognostication from the analysts at PwC inSizing the Prize, AI canadd north of $15 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. Investors don't have to dig too deeply to find that stocks that have enjoyed outsized benefits from the rise of AI. For instance, graphics processing unit (GPU) giantNvidia(NVDA-2.02%)surged from a $360 billion market cap at the end of 2022 to well north of a $3 trillion valuation in around two years. Nvidia's GPUs are effectively thebrains that make AI-accelerated data centers tick. Image source: Getty Images. But a strong argument can be made that Nvidia's spot atop the pedestal has been usurped by another high-flying AI stock. I'm talking about data-mining specialistPalantir Technologies(PLTR1.64%). Shares of Palantir have skyrocketed by 1,660%, as of the closing bell on April 25, since the end of 2022. It's also become the ninth most-valuable publicly traded company in the tech sector. In less than a week, following the closing bell on May 5, Palantir will be lifting the hood on its first-quarter operating results -- and you best believe professional and everyday investors will be paying close attention. While Palantir's run-up has been nothing short of phenomenal, there are tangible reasons to believe this AI colossus won't live up to the hype on May 5. Before diving into the various reasons Palantir may be primed to disappoint next week, let's offer some background on how it became one of Wall Street's most-influential tech and AI-driven companies. One of the prime catalysts for Palantir is its moat. This is a company with two core operating segments: Gotham and Foundry. The former is an AI-drivensoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) solutionthat assists federal governments with data collection/analysis, as well as military mission planning and execution. Meanwhile, the latter enables businesses to streamline their operations by better understanding their data. While there may be SaaS solutions that compete with select aspects of Palantir's operations,no other business comes remotely closeto matching the services it provides at scale. What this means is Palantir's operating cash flow tends to be highly predictable and transparent. To build on this point, the bulk of Palantir's growth has originated from its Gotham platform. When Palantir locks in contracts with the U.S. government and its allies, it's typically securing four- or five-year deals. Multiyear contracts further ensure that Palantir's sales and cash flow are predictable. Something else investors get with Palantir, aside from sustained double-digit sales growth, is recurring profitability. Palantir turned the corner to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits well ahead of Wall Street's consensus expectations. This validated the company's core operating model (Gotham), and offers plenty of hope that Foundry will be a profit driver in the latter-half of the decade. Speaking of Foundry, it closed out 2024 having added nearly 200 commercial customers -- up 52% to 571. This is still a relatively new segment that should have no trouble sustaining a rapid growth rate and landing larger clients. To round things out, Palantir Technologies is sitting on an enviable treasure chest totaling $5.23 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, to go along with no debt. This cash affords management the ability to aggressively invest in its platform, as well as reward shareholders via stock buybacks. Image source: Getty Images. To give credit where credit is due, Palantir absolutely deserves a valuation premium for its sustainable moat, push to profitability, and healthy cash position. But with a market cap of nearly $265 billion, as of the closing bell on April 25, Palantir ishighlyunlikely to live up to the hype. One of the bigger concerns is what the company's outlook for Gotham might entail. While its multiyear government contracts and subscription-based Foundry platform offer some level of cash flow transparency, it's no secret that the Trump administration is looking for ways to reduce government spending. Though Republicans have, traditionally, supported robust defense spending, this administration's messaging has wavered on a number of issues. In February, the Pentagon proposed cutting its budget by 8% in each of the next five years. This lack of clarity on defense spending isn't good news for Palantir's outlook. Wall Street's AI darling is also butting heads with history. Despite artificial intelligence being the hottest thing since sliced bread, no next-big-thing trend in more than 30 yearshas avoided an early stage bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology would gain widespread adoption and/or utility. With most businesses nowhere close to optimizing their AI solutions, or even generating a positive return on their AI investments, it would appear artificial intelligence is following the same trajectory as prior next-big-thing bubbles. Theaforementioned silver lining for Palantiris that its multiyear contracts via Gotham and subscription revenue from Foundry should insulate its sales from any near-term drop-off. However, companies on the leading edge of next-big-thing technologies are often dragged down by weaker investor sentiment when bubbles burst.Nvidia's declining gross marginis an indication that we may already be on the downswing of the AI bubble.  PLTR PS Ratiodata byYCharts. PS Ratio= price-to-sales ratio. But Palantir's most prominent issue just might be its valuation. Prior to the dot-com bubble bursting in the early 2000s, leading internet and infrastructure companies at the time peaked atprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiosranging from 30 to 43. Similarly, Nvidia topped out at a P/S ratio of roughly 42 last summer. As of the closing bell on April 25, Palantir stock was commanding a P/S ratio of (drum roll)96! Companies on the leading edge of a next-big-thing trend have commonly seen their valuations crater following P/S ratios north of 30.Palantir Technologies is currently three times above this level. There isn't an industry-leading public company that's been able to maintain a premium anywhere close to where Palantir stock is trading at. Regardless of what Palantir reports on May 5, it'sunlikely to justify a P/S ratio of 96, or even half of this level.",

        "header": "5 Reasons to Buy Broadcom Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "It's been a tough past few weeks for the stock market. And understandably so. New tariffs don't just threaten to make most goods more expensive here and abroad. These higher prices could cause economic weakness, perhaps even prompting a global recession. Technology stocks have been hit particularly hard, of course, since they're arguably the most vulnerable to economic headwinds. Applying a shop-worn clich\u00e9 to the current situation, investors have thrown the baby out with the bathwater.Broadcom(AVGO0.08%)shares are down 25% from their January peak thanks to the marketwide pullback. But this misguided move is ultimately a buying opportunity for five key reasons. Most investors have heard of Broadcom. Most investors, however, would also be hard-pressed to name a single product it manufactures. That's OK, though. Being slightly off of the radar has allowed the company to become a dominant force in its sliver of the technology arena. In simplest terms, Broadcom makes digital communications components for computer networks, data centers, and telecommunications platforms. This includes everything from the circuitry that connects hard drives to motherboards, wireless antennas, fiber-optic interfaces, and more, plus all the software needed to make this hardware work. But the bulk of its recent growth has been driven by the explosive advent ofartificial intelligence(AI). WhileNvidiamight make the computer processors found in the heart of the vast majority of the world's AI platforms, these processors are only part of this technology. Nvidia's processors must also be intraconnected with tech that's just as quick. That's where products like Broadcom's new Sian3 and Sian2M digital signal processors make a difference, handling AI data up to a blistering pace of 1.6 terabytes per second. And that's just one of many data center solutions Broadcom offers. The artificial intelligence industry now recognizes it needs much of what Broadcom makes. That's why the company's AI-driven revenue grew 77% year over year during the quarter ending in early February, growing to more than one-fourth of Broadcom's total business. It would be inaccurate to say this company doesn't have competitors. Smaller outfits likeCoherent,Amphenol, andQualcommall operate in most of the same spaces that Broadcom does. None of these other players, however, seem to enjoy the same dominant reach that Broadcom does within the digital communications and connectivity space.JPMorgananalyst Harlan Sur suggests Broadcom controls on the order of 80% of the AI data center ethernet switch market, for instance, underscoring the idea that it's the industry go-to name when it comes to interconnecting a massive rack of individual AI processors. The company's portfolio of 20,000-plus patents plays an important role in the enduring dominance of its top markets. But credit must also be given to the fact that Broadcom'sresearch and developmentarm is one of the best as well as one of the best-funded in the business, with nearly $10 billion being spent on R&D last year alone. That makes it tough for would-be competitors to catch up -- and then keep up -- with its work. Broadcom's previous quarter's AI business clearly soared. But was that just a one-off surge that can be chalked up to lucky timing? Probably not. As CEO Hock Tan suggested in December, the market for AI data center components that Broadcom already dominates could be worth between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027. For perspective, the company only did about $4 billion worth of artificial intelligence business in its most recently completed quarter. That leaves a great deal of room for growth for at least a few more years. This is still just the beginning. Market research firm Market.us believes the worldwide artificial intelligence data center market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 27% through 2034. And that's just one of Broadcom's businesses. Non-AI technology (like fiber-optic communications and wireless connectivity) markets will still continue growing during this time as well, as the world continues to digitize, automate, and wirelessly connect itself. This growth won't be perfectly even, however. Its pace will ebb and flow along the way. Broadcom stock is likely to ebb and flow at least as much, as investors price in their ever-changing opinions on this evolving pace of progress. Shareholders won't necessarily be fully subjected to every short-term swoon, though. See, while the bulk of this ticker's price reflects the company's top- and bottom-line growth, Broadcom is one of the few technology stocks that also pays a regular dividend out of its earnings. While the current forward-looking yield of 1.4% isn't exactly thrilling, itisrespectable. It's also based on adividend that's been raisedin each of the past 14 years and by more than a little. The stock's split-adjusted quarterly dividend payment has roughly doubled over the course of just the past five years, underscoring the strength and reliability of the underlying company's profit growth. Finally, buy Broadcom stock like there's no tomorrow simply because the stock's on sale in a big way. Again, this ticker's pullback from its January high makes enough superficial sense. Investors panicked over the onset of what's since turned into a complicated tariff standoff between the world's top two economic superpowers. The toll this might take on Broadcom still isn't completely clear. But the crowd isn't going to risk finding out the hard way that it's sizable. Many people are understandably heading to and staying on the sidelines. Curiously, however, analysts aren't flinching. Even with ample time to consider recent developments and change their minds about Broadcom's likely future, the vast majority of these professionals still consider this stock a strong buy. They also sport a consensus price target of $239.78, which is 27% better than Broadcom stock's present price. That's not a bad way to start out a new position. Sure, the analyst community as a whole can sometimes be wrong. This seems less likely with a closely watched name like Broadcom, though. It's more likely than not that this level-headed crowd sees through all the short-term noise that most investors don't see through at this time, recognizing how important and resilient the company's products are to the telecom andtechnologysectors.",

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia Will Beat the Tariff Turmoil (and the Stock Will Soar)",
        "content": "Everything seemed to go right forNvidia(NVDA-2.02%)last year. The chip designer saw enormous demand for its new Blackwell architecture and reported record levels of revenue and profit -- and investors rushed to buy the stock. TheDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI0.28%)even invited Nvidia to join, and this new member delivered the best performance in the index for the year, advancing more than 170%. But this year, things have been much more difficult for the artificial intelligence (AI) superstar. President Donald Trump announced a broad plan to tax imports from countries around the world, and that translates into higher costs for companies that import materials and products. Nvidia just so happens to be one of those companies, as it makes most of its AI chips in Taiwan. Of course, Nvidia isn't alone in this situation. Most tech companies rely heavily on other countries for the manufacturing of their products, and companies in other sectors, from retail to automobiles, also use imports. However, Nvidia has attracted a great deal of attention since earnings have been so strong in recent times, and this earnings model is based on production abroad. Though tariffs definitely will be a challenge for Nvidia and others, my prediction is Nvidia will beat the tariff turmoil and the stock will soar. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has provedto be proactivein various situations in the past, and it's going that route this time, too. The company mainly produces its AI chips in Taiwan throughTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, though in recent times has moved some production to TSMC's Arizona facility. TSMC is on board with this shift to U.S. production and recently increased its investment in U.S.-based manufacturing to $165 billion. This should support Nvidia's production growth here. Earlier this month, Nvidia announced a major move that could greatly reduce its exposure to import tariffs over time. The company has launched an effort that will result in its AI supercomputers being entirely produced in the U.S. The company aims to manufacture as much as $500 billion in AI infrastructure through partnerships at home over the coming four years. This activity will take place at TSMC's already existing plant in Arizona, and Nvidia also is building two plants in Texas with partnersFoxconnand Wistron. The company expects production to ramp up at these plants within 12-15 months. This won't shield Nvidia frompotential tariffsthat could take effect in the near term, but it should reassure investors that any tariff pressure on earnings would be short-lived. Trump initially rolled out tariffs that included all imports, then exempted electronics so that his administration could determine a separate level of tariffs for the industry. At the moment, products such as smartphones and semiconductors don't face duties. The president's move to exempt electronics came after companies and analysts flooded social media and the news with comments and reports about how destructive the initial plan would be for the industry. Trump's move to exempt these goods temporarily and consider a new tariff level suggests eventual tariffs may not be set at extreme levels. Another positive sign is the government's negotiations with countries regarding the general tariff plan. All of this shows flexibility exists, sotech companiesmight eventually negotiate if they aren't satisfied with the government's plan. Let's get back to my prediction. The two things above make me confident that Nvidia will beat the tariff turmoil. By that, I mean tariffs won't significantly hurt earnings growth over time. It's important to keep in mind that today, Nvidia generates strong profitability on sales, withgross margingreater than 70%, and likely has room to compensate in various areas for higher costs in the near term. Even if we see a dip in profitability levels, I'm not expecting a decline to be huge or long-lasting. Though the U.S. manufacturing plan represents a big investment, it should increase efficiency over time and lower the risk of supply-chain disruptions. As all of this takes shape, I won't be surprised if Nvidia's stock price soars.",

        "content": "If you're feeling overwhelmed by the stock market right now, you're not alone. TheS&P 500had one of its fastest drops on record in early April, and theNasdaq Compositehurtled into a bear market, falling more than 20% from its high just in February. President Donald Trump's trade war with just about every U.S. trading partner and signs of a weakening economy have put investors into a defensive position, and it's unclear when or how this period of uncertainty is going to end. At times like these, picking individual stocks is especially difficult so it's worth considering investing inexchange-traded funds(ETF) as an alternative. These investments trade like stocks, but they do the hard work of choosing the stocks for you, typically for a nominal fee. ETFs are either actively managed, meaning a fund manager will buy and sell the stocks inside it, or they track an index like the S&P 500. If you have $250 in available funds and you're looking for a tech ETF to invest in to capitalize on the recent sell-off, one of the best choices out there is theVanEck Semiconductor ETF(SMH-0.44%). Image source: Getty Images. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks theMVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, which aims to follow the overall performance of companies in the semiconductor production and equipment industry. The ETF has a long track record of beating the market, as the chart below shows.  Data byYCharts. As you can see from the chart, not only has the VanEck ETF trounced the S&P 500, but it's also beaten its rivaliShares Semiconductor ETF(SOXX-1.21%). That gap between the SMH and the SOXX is owed to the SMH's increased concentration. The table below shows the fund's top 10 holdings. Data source: VanEck Semiconductor ETF. As you can see, the ETF is highly concentrated in Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom stocks, which make up nearly 40% of the fund. All three of those stocks have performed well in recent years and are considered leaders in the AI boom. They have also driven the fund's recent outperformance, which has come from the AI leadership of those three stocks. The SMH's track record speaks for itself as few stocks, let alone ETFs, have jumped by 600% over the last decade. However, past performance does not guarantee future returns in the stock market. Still, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF looks well-positioned to keep outperforming the stock market. Its top stocks are still growing rapidly, and the fund trades at a relatively modestprice-to-earnings ratioof 32, compared to the S&P 500 at 24.5. That does represent a premium to the broad market, but it seems deserved based on the growth rates of its top three holdings.  Data byYCharts. The average revenue growth rate of these three stocks is about 50%, which is much faster than the overall market, and TSMC's revenue growth rate even accelerated in its most recent quarter, showing that the AI boom driving these stocks is far from over. Over the longer term, the need for semiconductors should only continue to grow, driven by AI and future technologies that the market isn't yet pricing in. Meanwhile, the top chip stocks have all built formidable competitive advantages, which should help them continue to outperform the broad market. While the coming months are likely to remain volatile, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF should continue to deliver strong growth over the long term thanks to the strength of its top holdings and increasing demand for semiconductors. That should provide an outsized return for your $250 investment.",

While there are plenty of AI stocks that look rather exciting right now, there are two in particular that are on my radar as we head into May. I already added one of them to my portfolio, and the other is at the top of my watch list right now. Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.17%), which is more commonly referred to simply as AMD, is often overlooked by investors because it holds a distant-second market share in the data center graphics processing units (GPU) space to chipmaking behemothNvidia, which has about 95% of the space.

For example, AMD's desktop and laptop central processing unit (CPU) business has been impressively taking share fromIntelfor years (and it doesn't compete with Nvidia here). New models of AMD's Ryzen line of AI-optimized processors are especially promising. AMD also makes chips for mobile devices, as well as for a variety of other applications, such as gaming and autonomous vehicles. To be clear, data center chips are abigpart of AMD's business and the fastest-growing part with 94% year-over-year revenue growth in 2024, but there is a lot more to this company. In 2024, the company grew revenue and earnings per share by 14% and 25%, respectively, and this momentum could continue for years to come. AMD trades for nearly 60% less than its 2024 AI boom-fueled peak -- and for about 22 times forward earnings, which I think could be a steal given the momentum and opportunities ahead. Applied Materials(AMAT-0.98%)isn't exactly a household name, but many of the products made by the top semiconductor manufacturers (including Nvidia) are produced with the company's equipment. Specifically, Applied Materials makes and services semiconductor manufacturing equipment that is used to produce and package chips. As chip designs become more complex, newer and more specialized equipment is needed to make them. For example, some of the largest chipmakers are moving to backside power delivery (moving power wires to a more efficient configuration at the bottom of a silicon wafer), and this creates an additional $1 billion estimated market opportunity for the company. Overall, the global semiconductor industry is expected to roughly double in size by 2032, so there should be nice growth tailwinds for the foreseeable future. Applied Materials is a highly profitable business with a 23% net margin over the past four quarters and has done a fantastic job of smart capital allocation, especially through buybacks. With the stock trading for just 16 times forward earnings, this proven AI winner could be worth a closer look. To be completely thorough, it's important to mention that the economic uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's trade policy, interest rates, and recession possibilities isn't done. The same can be said for AI spending concerns. So, if you invest in one or both of these stocks, it's wise to brace for significant volatility.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.09%)has quickly risen from an obscure semiconductor company to become a household name. The company's success has mainly been driven by its skyrocketing data center sales, which have boomed as technology companies commit hundreds of billions of dollars to build the most advanced artificial intelligence (AI). Thelatest researchfrom The Motley Fool shows that Nvidia easily leads the pack when it comes to data center sales, with $35.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. For reference, Nvidia's closest data center competitor,International Business Machines, had just $4.2 billion in data center sales during the same period. But how safe is Nvidia's most important revenue source against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's tariffs and a potential economic slowdown? Here's what investors should pay close attention to. Image source: Getty Images. To understand just how important Nvidia's data center processor sales are to the company, consider these stats: Nvidiadoesn't provide specific gross margin figures by revenue segment, but with the vast majority of the company's sales coming from data centers, it's safe to assume that of the company's 75% gross margin, most is coming from its data center segment. This has made Nvidia very profitable, with the company raking in $2.99 in adjusted (meaning not meeting generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share last year, up 130% from the previous year. Large tech companies, includingAmazon,Alphabet,Microsoft,Meta Platforms, and others have all tapped Nvidia's processors for their data centers, but demand for its processors is global as well. \"Countries across the globe are building their AI ecosystem as demand for compute infrastructure is surging,\" Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on the company'srecent earnings call. Semiconductors are exempt from Trump's tariffs for now, but that might not always be the case. The White House has said it's looking intosemiconductortariffs, and Trump has said they could be coming soon. That's why Nvidia recently announced that it's moving manufacturing of itsBlackwell processor, its most powerful chip, to the U.S. It will take some time for this transition to occur, with Nvidia saying it will happen over the next 12 to 15 months. Nvidia isn't completely out of the woods with tariffs, considering that the Trump administration could still add new tariffs any day and Nvidia's switch to U.S.-based manufacturing for Blackwell won't happen overnight. What's more, investors need to know that some tech companies have recently cut some of their data center spending. Companies and economists are increasingly concerned that tariffs could cause a recession, and some tech giants have responded by reducing data center spending. For example, Microsoft paused a $1 billion data center project in Ohio recently, and Amazon temporarily paused some data center leases in Europe. While some other cuts could materialize, it's important to note that all of these tech giants are eager to stay ahead of the competition in the AI race, which means a drastic pullback in AI data center investments isn't likely. All of this indicates that Nvidia's data center growth is likely to continue its trajectory for now, but investors should certainly keep an eye on what's happening with tariffs and the economy. If more tech giants announce spending cuts or the U.S. slips into a serious recession, then Nvidia's data center golden goose may not lay as many eggs as it has in the past.",

        "content": "As earnings growth has slowed for the Magnificent Seven \u2014 the group of stocks comprised of Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 the rest of the S&P 493 has gained momentum and closed the gap with the leading tech giants. Yahoo Finance hostJulie Hymanassesses forecasts anticipating the pick-up in S&P 493 performances. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Indeed, magnificent seven and their earnings growth has really propelled earnings growth overall for the market, for the S&P 500 specifically. This chart comes to us via Lori Calvasina of RBC, uh, the chief equity strategist there. So here, let's just look at the entire S&P 500 and the trajectory of earnings growth that we've seen over the past few years, 2023, 24. What's expected for 25, 26, and 27. So a little choppy here, particularly this dip that we're expecting to see this year before coming back, but kind of steady averaging around 10% or so. Then we just look at the magnificent seven specifically, which, whose growth far surpassed that of the rest of the S&P 500 for the last couple of years. This year, it's really expected to decelerate and remain that way for the next couple of years. Part of this is, it's just difficult to maintain that pace of earnings growth, especially since at least some of this came from NVIDIA, which was seeing leaps in year-over-year gains, as we were really seeing the beginning of the AI trend start to take hold. And then finally, we have the other 493, the S&P 500 excluding the magnificent seven. What's notable here is that after we saw, again, sort of choppy growth over the last couple of years, we're expected to see a little bit of an upward gain before stabilization in 2027. And this is what we've been hearing from a lot of strategists, this idea that as the magnificent seven slows down in terms of its earnings growth, that the other companies will start to pick up. We heard that most recently from Ryan Dietrich of Carson Group at the top of the show. We know this time two years ago and last year was all about Mag 7. That's where most of the growth and earnings growth were coming from. But it is, um, it has been, you know, broadening out, I guess is what I want to say. Now with the market acting the way it's been, it's a little different, but we think a broadening out still makes sense. And that's what's so interesting here, Josh, is that even amidst all of the tariff uncertainties and all of this going on, that these types of earnings estimates have largely held intact. In other words, that big idea that the Mag 7 are going to slow a little bit and everything else is going to accelerate a little bit.",

        "header": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Nvidia Next?",
        "content": "It was nearly one year ago thatNvidia(NVDA-0.09%)last split its stock. That 10-for-1 stock split was the sixth in the company's history since entering the public markets in 1999. Shares proceeded to march to an all-time closing high about six months after last June's stock split. Shares have since retreated along with many others as theNasdaq Compositeindex briefly enteredbear market territoryin early April, declining more than 20% off recent highs. Yet Nvidia has been resilient and its share prices have recently rebounded. While the downturn in the stock market may not be over, it will eventually gain ground again. Nvidia continues to have a leading business covering artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, robotics, driver assistance, and self-driving technologies. That business is what should attract investors to Nvidia stock. Another stock split could also be in its future, though. And history shows that owning shares before they split can pay off. Image source: Statista. To determine why that might be, let's look at reasons companies split their stocks in the first place. After all, a split doesn't affect the value of the company one bit and even adds some expenses in logistics, legal fees, and other nominal costs. Splitting a stockcan increase liquidity by making shares more affordable for a larger group of investors. Retail investors are likely part of the increased trading volume because lower-priced shares look more attractive to those just starting out or with limited funds to invest.Fractional shares are offeredat many brokerages now, but most people probably don't utilize that rarely-promoted option. So a lower share price can appeal to more buyers. It is a perception of affordability. Companies also tend to split stocks that have trended higher. Announcing a split tends to give investors added confidence that further strong performance is ahead. The stock may also be included in more major stock indexes, especially those that use price-weighted calculations. Lastly, splits may also be announced with company employees in mind. Employee share purchase plans may get more participation if shares are more affordable to participants. So while stock splits don't directly affect the company's value, i.e., itsmarket capitalizationdoesn't change, investor perception and market activity can tend to aid future performance. Nvidia management can also look beyond short-term volatility toward positive future business developments to gain confidence to announce another stock split. Most investors are focusing on Nvidia's growing data center revenue. That segment accounted for the bulk of its revenue growth inthe past fiscal yearended Jan. 26, 2025. But each of its other three segments has increased revenue annually over the last two years. Gaming is a more than $10 billion segment. It only accounted for about 9% of sales last year, though, so many investors are discounting Nvidia's other growth areas. Perhaps its greatest growth potential comes from automotive and robotics end uses. That segment is at a much lower base than data centers, and itstotal addressable marketcould be ready to go through a growth spurt. Automakers already include advanced driver assistance packages and may be on the cusp of selling fully autonomous vehicles.Robotics technologymay also be at the point of transition from stationary industrial uses to mobile, humanoid versions that can help businesses further improve efficiency. Those are better reasons to buy Nvidia stock than anticipating the next stock split. History does show that a split announcement could result in market-beating returns. Yet I think Nvidia stock will outpace the market simply for fundamental reasons. Nvidia's management and board of directors will likely wait for ongoing market turmoil to settle before announcing its next stock split. It makes sense for investors to own the stock regardless, though. That way, you can participate in a fast-growing company along with any future stock splits that might be announced.",

We are also one of the first adopters of NVIDIA Omniverse blueprint for AI factory digital twins, advancing data center design and operational efficiency.In Q1, we expanded our footprint at several top-tier customers and further our relationship with key ecosystem partners. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Rapidus on two-nanometer IP development. And this quarter, we are pleased to share that Rapidus has made a wide-ranging commitment to our core EDA software portfolio across digital, custom analog and verification solutions.In Q1, we deepened our partnership with Socionext through a broad expansion of our EDA software, particularly AI-driven digital solutions, along with our system software. We furthered our partnership with a marquee hyperscaler through a broad proliferation of our digital and verification software, particularly our AI-driven Cadence Cerebrus and Verisium solutions.We expanded our collaboration with Intel foundry by officially joining the Intel Foundry Accelerator Design Services alliance. From systems on chip to advanced IP for AI and HPC applications, Cadence's inclusion in the Alliance helps Intel Foundry customer remain at the forefront of innovation.Now let's talk about key product highlights for Q1. Our IP business grew 40% year-over-year in Q1 as we continue to benefit from the strong market opportunities offered by AI, chiplet-based architectures, and the foundry ecosystem build-out. We secured a major expansion at a global marquee system company for our AI, HPC design IP and deepened our partnership with a major foundry through their commitment to our memory and interface IP.Following our pending acquisition of Secure-IC last quarter, we continue to build out our design IP portfolio. And earlier this month, we entered into a definite agreement to acquire Arm's Artisan Foundation IP business. Our Tensilica DSP is the defacto choice for automotive ADAS and infotainment systems and continued being widely integrated into vision, radar, LiDAR, and audio systems for the autonomous driving as well as emerging robotics use cases.Our core EDA revenue grew 16% and year-over-year in Q1 with further proliferation of our digital full flow at the most advanced nodes. Cadence Cerberus AI solution continued its strong momentum with nearly 50 new logos in Q1 and well over 1,000 tape-outs till date.Engineering change orders or ECOs are a critical part of any design process. AI is particularly suitable to dramatically improve ECOs. Using the new Cadence Conformal AI ECO flows, MediaTek saw early positive results, generating 83% smaller ECO patches in nearly half the run time.MediaTek also improved run time and memory by 100x through its deployment of Conformal AI low power. Our collection of new smart ECO technologies has better premises automotive functional ECO run times by more than 50% while improving quality. Our flagship Virtuoso platform, the industry's gold standard for advanced node custom analog and mixed signal design, continue to expand into new areas, such as photonics and circuit and yield optimization.Ever-increasing complexities in system verification and software bring up continue to drive secular demand for our market-leading Palladium Z3 and Protium X3 platforms.

Our AI-driven substitute router, the industry's premier solution for full package routing of complex 3D-IC designs saw strong customer interest and engagement during the early adopter program.In summary, I'm pleased with our Q1 results and the continued momentum of our business. The growing complexity of chip and system design, coupled with the transformative potential of AI-driven automation creates significant opportunities for our products to enable and empower our customers. In addition to our strong business results, I'm proud of our high-performance inclusive culture.I'm thrilled that Cadence was recently named by Fortune and Great Place to Work, yet again as one of the 100 best companies to work for. ranking number 11. Now I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q1 results and our updated 2025 outlook. John Wall Thanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered excellent results for the first quarter of 2025 with broad-based strength across all of our businesses. Robust design activity and customer demand drove 23% year-over-year revenue growth and 42% non-GAAP operating margin for Q1. And we are tracking ahead of our original forecast for 2025. We repurchased more Cadence shares than initially planned in Q1, which reduced our share count.Here are some of the financial highlights from the first quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1.242 billion. GAAP operating margin was 29.1%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 41.7%, the GAAP EPS was $1, with non-GAAP EPS $1.57.Next turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash balance at quarter end was $2.778 billion, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $2 billion and $500 million. Operating cash flow was $487 million. DSOs were 44 days, and we used $350 million to repurchase Cadence shares.Before I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to share the assumption that is embedded. It contains the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year.Our updated outlook for 2025 is revenue in the range of $5.15 billion to $5.23 billion. GAAP operating margin in the range of 30.25% to 31.25%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 43.25% to 44.25%, GAAP EPS in the range of $4.21 to $4.31, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $6.73 to $6.83, operating cash flow in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares.With that in mind, for Q2, we expect revenue in the range of [$1.250 billion to $1.27 billion], GAAP operating margin in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 41.5% to 42.5%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.89 to $0.95 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.61. And as usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.In conclusion, Cadence is off to a strong start to the year. We are raising our 2025 revenue and EPS outlook. Our technology platform is essential to customers' R&D investment and our resilient software model positions us well in navigating today's dynamic macro environment.I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. And with that operator, we will now take questions. Operator (Operator Instructions) Harlan Sur, JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good to see the strong mid-teens percentage year-over-year growth in the core EDA business. On your China business in particular, the team did continue to see year-over-year growth acceleration, right, to plus 13% in the March quarter versus 10% in -- back in the December quarter. On top of this, tariff trade, regulatory dynamics are, I think, driving more focus on domestic China chip design programs, especially in AI, like we've heard, for example, ByteDance engaging on new custom AI chip programs.We've heard Alibaba as well in automotive, there continues to be more domestic China design programs firing both analog, power management and digital. So is this domestic focus and design activity, a potential tailwind for your China business? Are you getting more optimistic on a growth profile for your China business this year versus the team's prior view of flattish? Anirudh Devgan Harlan, great question. So first, I would like to say I'm pretty pleased by our performance in Q1. And the strength is coming in all the various product groups and also all the various geographies, like you mentioned. And the reason is even in this kind of dynamic macro environment, the customers are investing for the future and these R&D investment takes months to years. And as you know, we are tied to the design activity, which is strong.Now in China or actually in multiple countries, the AI development is taking multiple cycles. I mean not just -- as you know, not just the development of data centers, but I've said for a while now that also the development of physical AI systems, which is autos and robots and drones. And China is particularly strong in that as well.So overall, I think we are pleased with the silicon and system development driven for AI. I'm pleased with the performance of the China business and the start of the year, but we're still prudent assuming China flat for the whole year. John, do you want to comment on that? John Wall No, I think that's the important point that design activity remains strong in China, but we're continuing to be prudent with the guide for the year and continue to assume that China revenue is flat year-over-year at the midpoint of that guidance. Operator Lee Simpson, Morgan Stanley. Lee Simpson Great. Great quarter to everyone. I mean, as we all know, your main offering is a software and services product which may not have the same risk from reciprocal tariffing regimes that other parts of semiconductor ecosystem does. And I think if you look at your hardware chip, it's an ASIC fab TSMC. So I guess one assumes this is only a limited exposure to tariffing into China.I guess what I'm asking more generally is, can you confirm if at all, at this point, where you think you do have any exposure to the tariffing regime announced by the US government, at least as you currently understand things? Anirudh Devgan Yes. So with respect to tariffs, I mean, there are two parts to it, like, one is the customer behavior, which I mentioned, we don't see any change at this time. The second is in our own products, and like you said correctly, software and services are not subject to tariffs.Now in terms of our hardware business, just to remind everyone, we do have multiple manufacturing lines in US and outside US and this was something we did as part of COVID a few years ago. So that's paying off well. So at this point, we don't believe that given our diversified supply chain, the tariffs will have effect on our hardware business as well, okay?Now on the other hand, we continue to monitor the situation. It's a dynamic situation. But I feel that we are more resilient for multiple reasons. One is -- one is that we are tied to the design cycle, we don't see that much change. Second is we are very diversified, both in terms of products and geographies.And third, we have our business model, it's a ratable business model. So even in these uncertain times, we feel that we have enough confidence and visibility to raise our outlook for 2025. Operator Gary Mobley, Loop Capital. Gary Mobley Yes. Sorry, guys. This question might be more for Anirudh. And the question is more and more tools that you sell like simulation, synthesis, place, and route, et cetera, run on generation-based compute and running GPU-based servers. How does this impact your licensing model? And more specifically, how does it potentially affect your annual contract value? Anirudh Devgan Okay. That's a good question. I think you mean that as we enrich our hardware -- the hardware that our software runs on, how does it affect our business model? So actually, first of all, I've talked about this three-layer cake for a while, right, which is the bottom layer of the cake being accelerate compute.So in the old days, we used to run on CPUs, mostly x86 CPUs. But now we run on all cancer CPUs, including ARM, and then GPUs, especially with our collaboration very strong collaboration with NVIDIA. And then for hardware, we have our own kind of Boolean processor because GPUs are excellent for numerical calculation, like circuit simulation or CFD or electromagnetics, but for zero-one kind of Boolean calculation, we make a special chip in palladium, right, which is a bullion supercomputer.So as a reason we have a very rich kind of set of offerings on the hardware side, -- now on the -- how we go to market, we maintain our previous model in which you can subscribe to our -- like the traditional licensing model. which is typically early license over a three-year term.But also, we are offering more and more cloud solutions, okay? And there is an uptick in cloud offering. Now sometimes the cloud could be on public clouds. So then access to CPUs, just like AWS has ARM CPUs and other cloud vendors and also GPUs. But we also have our own cloud offering through outsourced data centers, which are actually seeing good availability.So in our own Cadence, all the cloud, we also are packaging hardware and software together. A good example is Millennium. Just like we do with Palladium for our own chips. So I think this is a new kind of a business model to see how the customers will react. So we have the existing business model of software only, and then there's cloud SaaS model, especially as the hardware gets more rich in its offering. Operator Vivek Arya, Bank of America. Vivek Arya (technical difficulty) tools. And Anirudh I wanted to check what is Cadence's share gain opportunity because when I look at your main peer, they have double-digit sales exposure at Intel. And I'm curious, what is Cadence's exposure ? How soon can we start to see any potential share gains? Because these kind of relationships tend to be sticky. Just how large is the opportunity? And how soon can it start to show up tangibly for cadence? Anirudh Devgan Great question. I think your question is on Intel because I missed the beginning part of the question. But first of all, I'm very pleased by Lip-Bu's appointment as CEO of Intel. And for Cadence, you know for a while, I think our Intel has been a, I would say, a weak spot, relatively speaking, for Cadence. And this goes back 10, 15 years, it's a new issue.And then the other thing has been our investment in IP. So in general, I'm pleased with the -- so both of these two areas has been the main kind of areas to improve for Cadence IP and Intel. So IP, I think I'm pleased to see improvement last year and also in Q1 and I feel good about our IP business in general.And on Intel, I mean, this is a great opportunity as they have to, of course, reformulate their strategy and how they work with their ecosystem partners and we look forward to engaging with Intel in a lot more detail. And those discussions have already started and we'll keep you updated as they progress. Operator Gianmarco Conti, Deutsche Bank. Gianmarco Conti Yes. Congratulations on another great quarter. I guess, could you perhaps shed some detail into your hardware deliveries this quarter and whether you're seeing the demand for the third generation in line with what was expected, especially in customers except in the higher pricing in this environment.And also, I know that you've briefly mentioned about it not having any impact from tariffs. But could you share a few words on your Mexico plans where you assemble your -- your hardware and whether that could be a potential issue from a capacity production standpoint were the tariffs being enacted on that front? John Wall Gianmarco, great questions. The -- generally, our hardware revenue is limited by our production capacity because demand continues to outstrip our ability to supply the -- the hardware products. And as Anirudh mentioned earlier, we have a very resilient and agile supply chain capability, and that lessens the direct impact of tariffs. We -- we produce and build hardware for the US market in the US and for the international market outside the US.So that gives us kind of an optimized setup for hardware. So we're not seeing any real direct impact of tariffs in our numbers right now. Anirudh Devgan Also just to emphasize, we have multiple lines, right, not just the one you mentioned, so. Operator Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer Anirudh, what would you say are the two or three most important technical or product enhancement deliverables this year that may have already occurred or yet to occur this year, even if not with an immediate impact on revenue, but in terms of enhancing your overall technical capabilities or positioning?And then related to that, maybe you could talk about some of the investments you're making in some critical technology areas that may not get a lot of attention, one being, for example, physical verification -- your physical verification, maybe the next-generation silicon for hardware, Gen four ? And then lastly, maybe talk about some of the incremental investments you're making in your acquired simulation solver products. Anirudh Devgan Jay, that's a great question. And it's a multipart answer. But just to highlight a few key things. I mean, first of all, before I get into specifics, I mean you know this, but just to emphasize, we have a massive investment in R&D, right? I mean like 35% to 40% of our revenue is going to R&D.So at a given point, we always have a lot of exciting projects that are ongoing. In terms of a few themes that are critical, so of course, AI is supercritical and applying AI to the chip and system design process, I think we are seeing a lot of very good results. Actually, one thing on something like Cerebrus or AI-driven design tools, at this point we expect that the majority of -- more than 50% of the designs are now AI-enabled. Our tools are AI-enabled in those designs. And the others, I'm sure, will catch up as well.So -- but AI still has a long ways to go with all these new agentic features, and you will see us talk more about it throughout the year. So that's the number one thing I would like to highlight, and we have these five major platforms and all kinds of new models can be used in those.The second thing, which is also a pretty broad team, which makes sure we always state head is 3D-IC, okay? I mean 3D-IC is a big theme, another theme for next 5, 10 years. And you can see that in Blackwell. But right now, the packages can handle like three times reticle size, but they could easily go to ten times reticle size in the next few years.So there's massive investment in 3D-IC in terms of the tool flow, in terms of analysis of these complex system, thermal and electromagnetic warpage analysis. Of course, IP that is needed for high-speed SerDes and UCI and other things. So 3D IC remains as a critical focus for both our chip business, system business and IP business.And last thing is like, I think -- I think Gary asked earlier, is this rich hardware set, this bottom layer of the cake with ARM CPUs, x86 CPUs, Palladium hardware and GPUs. And we'll have some more developments next week at Cadence Live about that part. This hardware software co-optimization, I think, is going to be critical for our industry. So those are the three things I would highlight as top critical R&D focus area. Operator Jason Celino, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason Celino Great. Keeping to this IP topic, I think you planned to acquire ARM Artisan IP asset. I know this hasn't closed yet. But when we think about the foundational IP market, just curious why hasn't this been a bigger focus in the past and what's changed to make this opportunity more attractive? And then just to clarify with John, this pending acquisition is not included in guidance. John Wall Yes. So let me take the second part first, Jason, just to clarify that, yes, it's not in our current guide. It's not closed yet. So we haven't put that into the guidance. Anirudh Devgan And then, yes, I was actually pleased with this partnership and acquisition. Arm Foundation IP business has a very rich history, as you know, we started with Artisan a long time ago and has very good credibility in the market. And also as our IP position improves with our kind of performance over the last two years, we also have to expand our portfolio, and I'm pleased with the performance and PPA of the current portfolio, but we have to fill in the gaps in our portfolio and that's the reason we for example, acquired Rambus' IP business and then acquired Secure-IC a few months ago.And this is a critical piece. Foundation -- and it is becoming more and more critical versus five, seven years ago. Foundation IP became a lot more critical, especially in the interaction with the software, with place and route. Also, the there is a massive, as you know, foundry build-out, not just -- there are multiple foundries in multiple countries, and they all require Foundation IP. So that's the other reason I feel that Foundation IP is much more critical now.So it's a combination of Foundation IP being more critical. I need to broaden our IP portfolio work with our software tools and this opportunity came along to acquire a leading product in that space because we didn't want to enter the space with not a good product, but ARM's Artisan business has a good history grade product. So we -- we hope to finish that acquisition later in the year and talk to our customers about that. Operator Joe Quatrochi, Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi You mentioned that you were developing a full stack Agentic AI solution. I was wondering if you could talk about just the areas of the design workflow you're targeting first with that? Anirudh Devgan Great question. I mean it could be applied to almost all the design process. But sums that are super critical in terms of need, of course, verification is always critical because verification of course, we have great products with both hardware and software, but you never know when you are done with verifications, it's like an NP-complete problem.And so if you really look at now our SimAI offering, which is -- works with our logic simulator can improve performance by 5x to 20x, we have all these several customer endorsement -- public consumer endorsements for applying CMAI to verification.So I think verification to me is a great area for Agentic AI and then implementation is always a good area like things like Cerebrus can be further enhanced and you will see more and more developments from us digital design and Agentic AI pretty soon. So I would say that's the second area.And then one area that traditionally has not seen that much automation but is becoming more and more critical is package and PCB design, Allegro, an Allegro X and Allegro X AI. Actually I'm very optimistic that as pack design becomes super critical and package is the critical thing in a 3D-IC system, it's 3D-IC is another name for system in a package. So there is a more need for automation in packaging and automation in PCB design. So I'm actually pretty optimistic that AI can finally provide automation in packaging.And then I would say, analog migration, another big area and analogs like art plus science, but AI can also help in analog. So I think these are the three or four key areas that we will work on. But the scope of Agentic AI is throughout the -- our product spectrum. Operator Joe Vruwink, Baird. Joe Vruwink This might be an overly simplistic question relative to those before me. But your commentary and guidance strikes me as having greater visibility into strength during the second half of this year than maybe what's apparent just in our seat when analyzing the size of the 1Q beat or even your quarter-end backlog value. Can you maybe just speak to some of the things that changed for the better in the last 60 to 90 days that make you feel better about the 2025 outlook? John Wall Yes, Joe. I'll take that one. The -- yes, I mean, we're tracking ahead of our original forecast for 2025 with solid Q1 results. We only gave you the guide a few weeks ago for the year. So not a huge amount has changed. I think we have had a bit more strength in our recurring revenue. And of course, as you know, recurring revenue -- any beat in recurring revenue feeds through the rest of the year. So a small beat in Q1 kind of follows through in Q2, Q3 and Q4.And we were, like I said, ahead of the original forecast, even with including building in an expectation that -- that will pick up some slightly higher expenses on the tariff side. But we're still resilient on the tariff side, we felt it was right to raise the price. Operator Joshua Tilton, Wolfe Research. Joshua Tilton I always love it when the guy before you kind of steals your question. But I guess, just to put a finer point on things, I think Anirudh, you mentioned that the guidance still assumes that China is flat for the year. You guys are being prudent. I guess my question to that is, I understand there was an easier comp in 1Q, but year-to-date, are you guys seeing anything that suggests that China should actually grow flat for the year?Or I guess another way of saying it is the decision to keep China flat for the year and the guide prudence or more along the lines of your expectations of how things will shake out by the end of the year? John Wall Yes, Josh, I'll take that one as well. I think it's more prudent that we thought it's wise to remain prudent in the current macro environment. I think we're very resilient in this environment. I mean, a company with high gross margin and essential products should do well in this type of environment.But the bookings were really solid in Q1. We had stronger bookings than expected. Kind of fed into with more recurring revenue bookings as well. But -- and that fell into us tracking ahead of the original forecast for 2025. So we thought the right thing to do was raise the guides. Operator Siti Panigrahi, Mizuho. Siti Panigrahi Anirudh, if you see a lot of news going around, we saw DeepSeek early this year. Wondering how that's impacting the design velocity or even how you see the compute capacity will change. But at the same time also, we are seeing hyperscaler trying to push their data center build out. Are you seeing any kind of impact there? So would love to hear your views on this. Anirudh Devgan Yes, Siti, that's a great question. I mean this is a big question. Let me try to -- I mean it's a critical thing for the whole industry. I mean, first of all, I mean, when I talk to customers, DeepSeek is one advancement. I mean a lot of customers expect multiple advancements like this.The AI will get more and more efficient as -- and this happened if you look at even EDA's history, right, when AI started off, it was more like dense competition. And if you look at EDA history in the '70s, we started off with dense competition, and then we have Sparse computing, we have partitioning, we have hierarchy and latency, they're all cancer computer science methods that will be applied to AI, okay?So I believe that there will be multiple deep seek moments, not just one DeepSeek moment. But at the same time, the AI will get more and more prevalent in its use. And this happened in CPUs. I expect same thing to happen with AI and GPUs. So in terms of when we talk to customers.Now first, I have to remind you that we are on the design side, not on the production side. But in terms of design, we only see acceleration of more and more designs to do AI even on the data center side. And of course, NVIDIA is a great partner of ours, and I think NVIDIA is doing exceptionally well, but also a lot of the other hyperscalers, all the four or five major US hyperscalers and then companies in other countries are also investing heavily in their own designs, and we are glad to work with them.And then I mentioned before, the physical AI part of it, which is cars, planes and drones, is also there's a lot of design activity. Now even though the car market may not be as strong, but that's for current products, but they are designing for future products, which will be AI-enabled. And then the other thing, as AI gets more efficient, I think there will be more inference use. So there's a lot of design of insurance chips to support that.So right now in terms of design activity, I feel pretty good. And like I was mentioning before, even on the data center side, the 3D-IC is going to cause a massive change in complexity. Right now, we have Blackwell with like two kind of big dies with HPM, but the packaging road map is very aggressive by all foundries.So I think that is also going to drive new and new AI designs with putting more kind of big chips in packages and that should also drive AI performance and efficiency. So right now, we don't see any big change in terms of the design activity for AI. Operator Nay Soe Naing, Berenberg. Nay Soe Naing Minus on your SG&A segment, please. a very impressive quarter in Q1. And I was just trying to understand if you could maybe share where the stat is coming on, especially when we put it against the product market and your peers in the last three years, you've been growing at 2x to 3x what your competitors have been able to do. So I was wondering if there are any competitive market wins that's driving your performance, if not, what are the reasons, please?And maybe if I could squeeze in a part -- a second part of this question. The solid performance we've had in the past, does it -- any chance at all create any headwinds for you or tough comp for you going forward? John Wall Thanks for the question. And you're right to raise the comps, because I think one of the benefits for Q1 is that Q1 '24 was a pretty easy comp for us on the SG&A side. BETA performed well in Q1 '25, but we only acquired that in the middle of the year last year. So I think the first time BETA turned up in our results was Q3 '24.And then BETA is providing a huge amount of pull-through business for Cadence. So Cadence products are being sold alongside BETA products, and that's really helping us for growth. We're expanding reach to the longer tail customers through our e-commerce model. And we've seen strength in automotive and aero and defense. And I don't know, Anirudh, do you want to add anything about BETA? Anirudh Devgan BETA is performing great and also it has a pull-through to other parts of our portfolio. One thing we are always confident and I think you've seen some benchmarks in the industry in the past that our R&D products are solid. They are rewritten. They are -- they have no accuracy loss. They have much better performance because of massive parallelism whether it is on CPUs or GPUs. So we are always confident on our product side, and we continue to innovate there.I think what BETA helps is to increase the reach of those products because they are working with all the auto companies. And so not only we can benefit from performance of beta but also can sell our other products to those customers. And then we also improved our cloud offering and go-to-market with indirect channel. So I think you're seeing some benefits of that, better go-to-market operation on the system side. Operator Ruben Roy, Stifel. Ruben Roy Anirudh, I had a similar question to Jason's on IP. And you touched on this in your answer to that question. But just wanted to make sure I understood in terms of sort of these, I would say, accelerated pace of recent tuck-ins on the IP side. It sounds like they're opportunistic rather than customer-driven, wanted to make sure I got that right.And then the second part of the question is just maybe if you can update sort of how you're thinking about IP in terms of longer-term growth from that segment given all that's going on with foundry and customers, et cetera. Anirudh Devgan Yes. Great question. So I think in terms of IP, there are multiple factors. So one is our performance is better. The portfolio we had, especially the PPA, power performance in the area for TSMC, the most advanced foundry.The IP is just much better quality and performance. So and that's driving customer demand. So the customers want us to want get IP from us and want us to have a bigger portfolio, okay. So as a result, we do, of course, invest organically, and we will do in acquisition if we see a good fit, okay? But it's both a combination of what is available, but the customers are definitely driving us to broaden our portfolio. So that's one.Second thing is there is more and more foundry. So we are glad with our partnership with TSMC, but we highlighted even this time like Rapidus making massive investments. And of course, Samsung and Intel, and we are glad to. So there are at least four major foundries at advanced node along with all the foundries like Global and UMC at more mainstream nodes. So I think the foundry ecosystem is rich and that provides more opportunities in IP.And then the third thing, of course, is AI and 3D-IC and all this die-to-die IT. So for all these three reasons, I'm optimistic. We are performing well. We are increasing our portfolio. The market wants more IP from us. So I expect IP to -- of course, we had a good year last year, we had a very good quarter, Q1. So I expect IP to grow better than Cadence average going forward. Operator Blair Abernethy, Rosenblatt Securities. Blair Abernethy Nice quarter. Anirudh, just wondering if you could give us sort of high-level thoughts on the data center digital twins. You bought future facilities back in July '22, there seems to be getting some traction out there. I just want to see how you feel about the size of the TAM, the size of the opportunity there with that asset and sort of are there expansion opportunities beyond data centers? Anirudh Devgan Absolutely. The two areas that I have been very excited about, especially on the system side, one is, which is very close to the package, like I mentioned, thermal, electromagnetics, warpage because there's a massive transformation right next to the chip. And we are in a very strong position with Allegro and all the analysis tools. The second area is all the way at the data center level.That's why we acquired future facilities. And actually, it had a very strong Q1 and we also have a great partnership with NVIDIA there. NVIDIA is designing their data centers with our Cadence Reality Digital Twin and also working with joint partners as we go to market with them together on Cadence Reality.And that opportunity is huge. I mean, even we apply it to our own IT group, for example, we have our own data centers, right? So the product is general enough to be used in any data center and we saw like a 10% improvement in power, which is huge. And because typically, that's the area that has not seen a lot of analysis and automation, because it's typically done in like a typical construction kind of work whereas chip design is very analytical mathematical. So that area needs more kind of optimization and simulation.So I am optimistic. And then the way Cadence Reality works, there is a design side of it, in which we help customers design the data center. And then there's the operations side of it, in which we can analyze on the fly, use the Digital Twin to optimize their operation. So if you include both sides, I mean, the opportunity is huge. So -- but we are still kind of prudent in our assumptions like we do in everything, but I'm very optimistic about these two extremes.One is all the way to data center and second is all the way very close to the chip on the package. And that's where you see us investing yes. Operator I will now turn the call back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks. Anirudh Devgan Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence as our broad portfolio and product leadership ideally positions us to maximize the growing opportunities in the semiconductor and system industry. And on behalf of our employees and our Board of Directors, we thank our customers, partners and investors for your continued trust and confidence in Cadence. Operator Thank you for participating here today's Cadence's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.",

        "header": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.8% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share, indicating a change of +42.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.24 points to a change of +41.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.5%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.32 indicates a change of +25.5% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $42.68 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +63.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $193.39 billion and $237.92 billion estimates indicate +48.2% and +23% changes, respectively. Nvidia reported revenues of $39.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +77.9%. EPS of $0.89 for the same period compares with $0.52 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.26%. The EPS surprise was +5.95%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Nvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In early January, a little known Chinese AI company, DeepSeek, released its large language model (LLM), DeepSeek-R1, to an unexpecting world. This model was purportedly trained on very few high-end Nvidia chips and was highly efficient when compared to other leading models. This release set off a chain reaction where investors have had to grapple with the idea that the world may not need as many GPUs as previously thought, which hampered the Nvidia buy case and sent the P/E multiple down to its cheapest level in the past 5 years.\" A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.

The company said its \"comparable,\" or adjusted, earnings per share came in at $0.73 on revenue that declined 2% year-over-year to $11.1 billion. Analysts expected $0.72 and $11.22 billion, respectively. \"Despite some pressure in key developed markets, the power of our global footprint allowed us to successfully navigate a complex external environment,\" CEO James Quincey said.

At this time, the company expects the impact to be manageable.\" Shares of Coca-Cola were down about 1% shortly after the market opened Tuesday. They entered the day up about 15% since the start of the year. Earlier this month,analysts from JPMorgan raisedtheir price target for the soda maker's stock, as they said it could see a relatively limited tariff impact and prove to be a \"port in a storm\" amid market uncertainty.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When the two biggest players in cloud computing report earnings this week, the amount the companies are spending will be just as interesting to investors as how much they are making. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City Transit System Chips Away at Subway Fare Evasion NYC\u2019s Congestion Toll Raised $159 Million in the First Quarter Newsom Says California Is Now the World\u2019s Fourth-Biggest Economy The Last Thing US Transit Agencies Should Do Now At Bryn Mawr, a Monumental Plaza Traces the Steps of Black History Ahead of results from Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday, and Amazon.com Inc. on Thursday, there have been reports suggesting that both companies may be cutting back on their spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. That puts a spotlight on the capital expenditures announced in the latest earnings, which will offer insight into the outlook for AI demand and the broader consequences that might have for the economy. \u201cA slowdown in cloud computing or capex would scream economic caution and speak to recession fears in corporate America,\u201d said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund. \u201cAny cutback in growth is hurtful to valuations, and would be damaging to the overall market. While multiples have come down a lot, we\u2019re not drastically cheap by any historical measure. If we are on a recessionary path, multiples will get a lot lower.\u201d Both Microsoft and Amazon have declined this year, largely tracking the market lower as tariff risks have amplified concerns about economic growth. Amazon is more than 20% off a February peak, while Microsoft hasn\u2019t hit an all-time high since July. Microsoft was unchanged on Tuesday, while Amazon fell 1.5%. Amazon\u2019s weakness came after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the e-commerce company\u2019s reported decision to display the impact of tariffs on pricing was a \u201chostile\u201d act. The four biggest spenders on AI infrastructure \u2014 Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., along with Microsoft and Amazon \u2014 are expected to spend more than $300 billion in their current fiscal years. The money plowed into AI-related investments had led to soaring stock gains in companies like Nvidia Corp., Super Micro Computer Inc., and Arista Networks Inc. Recently, though, Microsoft and Amazon have been at the center of a shift in expectations around industry spending. Bloomberg News reported that Microsoft has pulled back on data center projects around the world, with some of the pause coming abruptly. TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias last week wrote that channel checks \u201cindicate material MSFT equipment order cancellations\u201d for data center supplies with a \u201clong-lead time.\u201d Separately, Wells Fargo Securities wrote that Amazon\u2019s web services business is pausing some data center leases, although Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon Web Services, later wrote that there \u201chaven\u2019t been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans,\u201d and that it continues to see \u201cstrong demand for both Generative AI and foundational workloads on AWS.\u201d Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Joe Tsai had warned in March of a \u201cbubble\u201d in data center construction. The emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek scrambled forecasts for future spending after the newcomer claimed performance that was comparable to U.S. models despite costing less and requiring fewer chips. Investors are also increasingly looking for the AI investments to translate to growth in a more pronounced fashion. Ned Davis Research closed its overweight recommendation on AI stocks last week, writing that the downturn in the group can continue, especially with the new risks created by the Trump administration\u2019s trade war. \u201cHigher policy uncertainty often leads to lower capex spending. We see no reason data center capex spending would be excluded,\u201d wrote Pat Tschosik, the firm\u2019s chief thematic strategist. He added that \u201cAI spending is seen as discretionary and, just as companies pull back on capex in an economic downturn, they pull back on AI application development as well.\u201d Alphabet Inc. reported capex of $17.2 billion last quarter, slightly more than had been expected. It plans to spend $75 billion on capex this year. The Google parent also posted better-than-expected operating profits for its Google Cloud business, even as sales slightly missed the analyst consensus. The company said there was more customer demand than company capacity for the cloud business, echoing comments made by all three cloud giants last quarter. Microsoft results are expected to show net earnings growth of 9.7% and revenue growth near 11%. Amazon\u2019s revenue is seen rising 8.2% with net earnings soaring almost 40%. Both are expected to grow consistently in the coming years, a key reason why Wall Street is nearly uniformly positive on them. For both names, more than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the shares. Jim Worden, chief investment officer of Wealth Consulting Group, is among those who retains a positive view on the pair. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see big reductions in capex, though there will likely be some discussion about being more efficient and how to best spend the money,\u201d he said. \u201cUncertainty is still really really high, but we\u2019ve barely touched the surface for AI demand and use cases, so investors need to be patient and play the long game.\u201d Tech Chart of the Day ServiceNow surged 22% last week, capping a record weekly gain, after the software company issued an outlook for sales growth that topped analysts\u2019 estimates, suggesting that software demand remains resilient even as the economy reels from the threat of tariffs. Top Tech Stories NXP Semiconductors NV announced a new chief executive officer as part of its quarterly earnings report and warned that the chipmaker was navigating \u201ca very uncertain environment\u201d due to tariffs. Krafton Inc. posted a better-than-expected 47% jump in quarterly operating income, driven by the continued growth of its PUBG game franchise. Sony Group Corp. is considering spinning off its semiconductor unit, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the PlayStation maker\u2019s latest effort to streamline its business and focus on entertainment. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. took the wraps off a new version of its flagship Qwen AI model, sustaining the breakneck pace of development that\u2019s characterized China\u2019s artificial intelligence sphere in the wake of DeepSeek. OpenAI now lets users shop for products within ChatGPT, the latest move by the artificial intelligence startup to expand the reach of its popular chatbot and challenge rivals like Google. Companies including Alphabet Inc. sold more than $18 billion of high-grade bonds on Monday, the most in one day since March, the latest sign that debt markets are stabilizing after the turmoil brought by tariff announcements early this month.

        "header": "The Best Vanguard ETF to Invest $1,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "Led byNvidia,Alphabet, andApple, theVanguard Growth ETF(VUG0.13%)has been a surefire investment winner for the better part of the past few years. However, if it feels like these powerhouse stocks aren't bouncing back quite as well as they should be from their early April low, you're not imagining things. Something's different, even if it's not easy to put your finger on what's different, or why. Chalk it up to the noisy environment. Regardless of the reason(s), if you've got an extra $1,000 -- or more -- sitting in your portfolio that you'd like to put to work, now's arguably the time to back off from growth stocks and take on more exposure to value names. TheVanguard Value ETF(VTV0.21%)will do the trick nicely. There are two major stock-picking schools of thought. Some investors are willing to take bigger risks and pay higher prices for a shot at above-average returns, while others will accept lesser returns in exchange for lower risk and more certainty. Broadly speaking, the former strategy is considered\"growth\" investing, while the latter is \"value\"-oriented. Neither approach is right or wrong. Since everyone's goals, risk tolerances, and timeframes are unique, their investing approaches should be unique as well. Indeed, plenty of investors use varying degrees of both strategies at any given time, as a means of balancing ever-changing risks with a stock's ever-evolving potential. As an example, most of the period between 2009 and now -- and especially since early 2020 -- favored growth stocks. Interest rates were lingering at record low levels for most of that stretch, providing cheap capital to companies that could do something constructive with it. The past 15 years have also been especially bullish for organizations that can make good use of technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and mobile connectivity. Ever since interest rates began rising during the end of the COVID-19 pandemic's height in 2022, though, most growth stocks -- and the companies behind them -- haven't been quite as impressive. These names are far from being doomed. It's difficult to see the effect of higherinterest ratesand a lethargic economy, especially when technology is racing ahead at an incredible speed while politics has evolved (or perhaps devolved) into a noisy contest, rather than a cooperative matter. A shift does seem to be brewing, though. As is so often the case once a bull market is fully matured, major growth opportunities are starting to thin out. Inflation and interest rates are seemingly leveling off as well, setting the stage for value stocks to rekindle the strength and leadership they quietly started demonstrating in the latter half of last year. That's not just a sequence-based or timing-minded assumption. Although growth stocks still have plenty of fans and supporters, based on their deep dive into the data, several analysts are now encouraging investors to begin making a strategic shift toward value stocks. Morningstar's chief U.S. market strategist David Sekera is one of these analysts. Last month, he suggested that value stocks were still undervalued by double digits, despite a slight recovery effort shortly before then. Based on data from investment management outfit ClearBridge Investment and FactSet, Franklin-Templeton portfolio manager Sam Peters noted last month that as of the end of last year, the U.S. stock market's value/growth valuation ratio had reached a 40-year low. That sets the stage for a cyclical reversal. David Levine, associate portfolio manager of Neuberger Berman's large-cap value fund, also pointed out last month: \"If you look atprice-to-book,price-to-sales, the spread between growth and value are at a 30-year high. If you look atP/E, the only other time that spread has been wider is the dot-com bubble.\" He added: \"You're seeing a little bit of a hint that we could see a normalization of valuations. As you see that, I think that's the beginnings of the drivers for value to outperform over the next few years.\" At the same time, Wellington Management's Nanette Abuhoff and Karoline Klimova suggest lingering inflation and subsequently lingering above-norm interest rates are \"in favor of value over the next three to five years.\" That's an awful lot of agreement on a matter that isn't particularly popular among investors at this time. Most people still want growth stocks to soar, so much so that they're shrugging off the reality of the current economic situation. This doesn't guarantee that value stocks will outperform growth in the near and not-so-near future, of course. It's not even a guarantee that value stocks will perform at all! All the analysts cited above acknowledge the possibility that theartificial intelligence-driven growthproduced by the market's biggest technology names will simply continue to dominate. Given AI's potential to empower almost any industry, that's a credible concern. In this instance, though, the bigger risk may still be taking a wait-and-see approach rather than diving in here and now. As Neuberger's Levine explains with his comparison of the two different approaches to stock-picking: Growth companies have this really bright future. If you miss the first 10%, 20%, 30% of the move, it's OK. You can still buy it. Value, you're playing for 50% move or 70% move. If you miss the first 20% or 30%, might not be worth going and chasing. Value is one of those things. You have to be a little bit early. If that doesn't feel comfortable enough for you right now, consider adding more value exposure gradually over the course of the coming few months, as capital becomes available. While there are several great value funds to consider, the Vanguard ValueETFis arguably one of the market's top overall choices. Not only does its underlyingCRSP US Large Cap Value Indexoffer you a very well-diversified, well-balanced mix of value stocks -- none of which make up more than 4% of its total portfolio -- the fund charges its shareholders a rock-bottom management fee of 0.04%. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more cost-effective option.",

        "content": "As four of the Magnificent Seven prepare to release earnings results this week \u2014 Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 the group of tech stocks has been noted to be underperforming a majority of their 200-day moving averages. Blue Chip Daily Trend Report chief technical strategist Larry Tentarelli comes on the Morning Brief to talk about Amazon's relationship with the broader retail sector and his cautious outlook on the Mag 7. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere. It's time now for today's strategy session. Earnings season in full swing with four magnificent seven members reporting this week. All but one of the Mag 7 stocks have fallen below their 200 day moving average. So what do the technical indicators spell out for what comes next? Joining us now, Larry Tentarelli. He's the chief technical strategist for the blue chip daily trend report. Larry, I think if we're talking about the Mag 7 this morning, I have to start with you on Amazon because this is a stock that is now dragging down the entire retail sector with it this morning. To what extent do you think that Amazon is able to pull out something in this earnings print this week that's going to allow them to be a positive bellwether for the Mag 7, despite the current market action that is very much related to Amazon as a retailer not as a tech company? Sure. That's a great question. I don't know that I've got a super clear answer for you. I think that the key thing is really going to be based on forward guidance. We really don't know what that's going to be. Amazon, because they're tied to the consumer, we're we're in uncharted territory because there is no blueprint for this tariff cycle right now. But I think it's going to be a very important tell for the sector. As you kind of look across some of the technical tells that are playing out within the tech sector at this juncture, of course two of those larger Mag 7 names in Nvidia and Apple were two of the first major companies, mega cap tech companies, to really initiate some of the pullback this year. Where are the technicals telling us now? So the Mag 7 still is not my favorite place to be. I see much stronger charts, Palantir, CrowdStrike, Netflix. The Mag 7, I think it got to be overowned. I think that a lot of foreign investors had parked money in the Mag 7 and as the US dollar has sold off, I think they've also sold the Mag 7 stocks. So the triple Q is still underneath the 200 day moving average. The S&P is. So I'm still, I don't like the Mag 7 that much yet, but I am open-minded that if the earnings come through and the stocks turn up, then that could be more positive. And do you think that there is potential for the opposite, for there to be much more downside for the Mag 7, given that you're already a little bit skeptical? I don't know if I'd say much more downside. So what we saw in the S&P 500 two weeks ago, highest weekly volume in 14 years, and it was a major upside reversal week. So historically, that's how many bear markets have bottomed. So I don't know that I'd say that there's major downside per se in the Mag 7, but I think we need to stay open-minded that if they if they're soft on guidance, you could see some downside. Is this still the year for sell in May and go away? Is that at play at all from what you're kind of seeing, especially given where investors have either been guided in the early kind of market correction to to buy on the dip versus what they're being guided towards now, which is sell the rally? Right. I think we're in a different market this year. So I can't say that sell in May, I think historically if we go back over the past 10 years, sell in May hasn't actually worked too well. I think this is a very high volatility news driven cycle. I do think last week we had a very bullish week and volatility is starting to come out of the market. But I think it's really very chart specific. I do think that the S&P and Nasdaq 100 are in a recovery phase. So I'm looking to buy the pullbacks as opposed to sell the rallies. Interesting. Larry, great to see you. Thanks for joining us in studio this morning. Thank you so much. Absolutely.",

Honeywell reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.51 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year to $9.82 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expected $2.19 and $9.59 billion, respectively. The gains were driven by a 9% sales increase at the company\u2019s Aerospace Technologies unit, and an 8% sales rise at its Building Automation division. Sales fell at its Industrial Automation and Energy and Sustainability Solutions segments. CEO Vimal Kapur said despite what he called \"the volatile macroeconomic backdrop,\" Honeywell'ssegment marginwas consistent with last year. Kapur added that although the company hasn't seen it in its performance yet, it faces \"an uncertain global demand environment for the remainder of 2025, and our company will work tirelessly, leveraging all tools available to us, to deliver for customers and shareholders.\" To that end, the company intends to take a \"multi-pronged approach to balance defendingmarginsand protecting volumes.\" Those steps include targeted price actions, finding alternative supply lines, and accelerating use ofartificial intelligence (AI)in engineering. Honeywell now sees full-year adjusted EPS of $10.20 to $10.50, compared to its previous outlook of $10.10 to $10.50. Kapur also noted that the company was \"even more confident\" about the benefits of its planned split into three separate firms that wasannouncedin February.

Alternatively, we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter and should start hunkering down.\u201d While blue-chip stocks come from well-known, established companies with a strong performance history, they are the most susceptible to changes in trade policies and tariffs. That\u2019s because their business operations span various borders. This might explain why the stocks come under pressure every time the US imposes tariffs, followed by retaliatory measures from other nations. Similarly, the prospects of the US Federal Reserve sticking with high interest rates to try and tame inflationary pressure from getting out of hand amid the trade war is another major headwind taking a toll on large-cap companies. Last year, the stocks exploded on expectations that the Central Bank would cut interest rates on inflation, dropping to acceptable levels. Likewise, blue chip stocks exploded on the artificial intelligence-driven run amid growing expectations of multibillion-dollar opportunities around revolutionary technologies. Fast forward, interest rate cut expectations have faded, and investors have started questioning opportunities around AI. The development of low-cost AI models is one factor that has significantly affected sentiments in the semiconductor sector, triggering a recalibration of the long-term outlook. According to analysts at research firm Citi, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff push could plunge the U.S. economy into a recession. In return, chip stocks could plunge by over 20% as they remain the most susceptible. \u201cWe believe the biggest risk to the semi sector is a recession resulting from tariffs,\u201d Chris Danely, a managing director at the bank, wrote to clients in a recent note. \u201cIf the tariffs continue for another month, we believe is it highly likely the supply chain will \u2018freeze up\u2019 given uncertainty, drastically lower order rates/inventory, and result in lower guidance across the board \u2013 similar to Covid.\u201d On the other hand, semiconductor stocks are not the only ones under pressure amid the escalating trade wars. Energy, industrials, and healthcare stocks are also feeling the brunt, resulting in some of the worst-performing blue chip stocks so far in 2025. To prepare this article, we began by listing all the holdings of the various blue chip ETFs like E.A. Bridgeway Blue Chip ETF and Vanguard Mega Cap ETF, among others. We then sourced the year-to-date share price returns for each company and selected the worst performers, as of April 25. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their year-to-date performance. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Year To Date Share Price Return as of April 25: -19.74% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and supplies graphic processing units for high-performance computing in data centres, computers and gaming consoles. It is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence-driven rally, having exploded to become a trillion-dollar company over the past two years. While the stock has posted double-digit percentage gains over the past two years, it is under immense pressure in 2025. The deep pullback has come from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) being caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between China and the US. Consequently, the company says it will take a hit of $5.5 billion on the US placing restrictions on the export of its H20 artificial intelligence chips specifically designed for the Chinese market. The H20 chip has less computing power than the more powerful AI chips banned in China. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) confirmed that it will require a special license to export the chip to China, a market that accounted for 13% of its sales last year and continues to send jitters in the market. Amid the restrictions, HSBC has downgraded the stock to a Hold from a Buy, concerned that the chipmaker\u2019s pricing strength in the AI GPU market is fading. Overall, NVDAranks 5thon our list of worst-performing blue chip stocks so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Further, AI is \"revolutionizing\" multiple areas, including healthcare and manufacturing, and NVDA \"is at the heart\" of many of these changes, Flax reported.

        "content": "We recently published a list ofBillionaire Andreas Halvorsen\u2019s 10 Stock Picks With Huge Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other billionaire Andreas Halvorsen\u2019s stock picks with huge upside potential. Ole Andreas Halvorsen is one of the prominent names among former employees of Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management. Robertson put together a formidable team of young traders \u2013 called the Tiger Cubs \u2013 in the 1990s, and most founded their own hedge funds after exit. Some other noteworthy names include Robert Citrone, Chase Coleman, and John Griffin. Halvorsen is the wealthiest Tiger Cub. Forbes Magazine ranks him at position 382 in the Richest People in the World in 2025 list with an $8 billion net worth. The Norwegian billionaire founded Viking Global Investors LP in 1999 with former Tiger Management employees Brian Olson and David Ott. Halvorsen was an equity trader at Tiger Management, and the strategies and principles he used there form a core foundation ofViking Global\u2019s approach. The fund conducts extensive due diligence on individual companies to identify undervalued (long) or overvalued (short) stocks. In short, Halvorsen generates much of his returns using the classic long/short equity strategy. READ ALSO:Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s 10 Large-Cap Stock Picks With Huge Upside PotentialandBillionaire Prem Watsa\u2019s 10 Stock Picks With Highest Potential. But most importantly, Halvorsen is popular for his bold bets. And on many occasions, these bets have returned massive gains. For instance, in the first full year of Viking Global\u2019s existence, the fund returned 89% after fees. More recently, in Q4 2024, the billionaire made three banks his top holdings. As of April 2025, the banking sector (within Halvorsen\u2019s portfolio) is performing well and is the only sector that is up year-to-date. If anything, Halvorsen\u2019s approach teaches that playing the long game might be a great strategy for favorable gains. Many of the stocks in Viking Global\u2019s portfolio have been there for many years, often bought when they weren\u2019t so popular. In that light, it is prudent to examine what stocks the billionaire is invested in, especially those with considerable upside potential. We reviewed Viking Global\u2019s Q4 2024 SEC 13F filings to compile this list. Out of the 86 holdings, we focused only on shares in companies and excluded interests in ETFs and options. From the result, we selected the top 10 stocks with the highest upside potential (as of April 28). Additionally, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

The GPUs are used in various applications, including gaming, professional visualization, AI, and data centers. Despite an unassailable lead, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to pursue new products and innovations. On April 15, 2025, the company unveiled the GeForce RTX 5060 family of GPUs. The product line includes graphics cards starting at just $299, making its advanced Blackwell architecture technology accessible to mainstream gamers. The new GeForce RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060 graphics cards feature NVIDIA DLSS 4, full ray tracing, and neural rendering technologies for exceptional performance. The company is also advancing its AI ecosystem through strategic partnerships. At ICLR in Singapore, the company is showcasing over 70 research papers. These cover multimodal generative AI, including Fugatto, the world\u2019s most flexible audio generative AI model. Additionally, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced that its NeMo microservices are now generally available, helping enterprises build AI agents with improved accuracy and efficiency. On April 17, 2025, Stifel analysts upheld their Buy rating and a price target of $180.00 for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. The opinion aligns with the broader Wall Street consensus that remains strongly bullish on the $2.60 trillion semiconductor giant.

Over the past week, NVIDIA's stock price experienced a 12% rise, aligning with broader tech sector gains amid a generally strong earnings season. The company's involvement in collaborations like Trend Micro's enhances its AI credentials, complementing overall positive market sentiment as investors digest optimistic earnings across various sectors. NVIDIA's price movement parallels broader index trends, with market enthusiasm potentially bolstered by such technology integrations and ongoing sector growth. You should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with NVIDIA (including 1 which is concerning). Uncover 13 companies that survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs. NVIDIA's recent partnership with Trend Micro, incorporating AI-driven threat detection, could significantly reinforce its AI capabilities. This collaboration is supported by NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture, which is expected to enhance its data center and AI workload prospects. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return has exceeded 1,397%, showing very large growth, reflecting strong market confidence. This remarkable performance places NVIDIA ahead of its competitors, with NVIDIA having outperformed the US Semiconductor industry, which saw a 7.9% increase last year, and the broader US market, which experienced a 7.7% rise over the same period. The integration of NVIDIA technology into cybersecurity frameworks could influence revenue and earnings forecasts positively, as analysts anticipate a 30.1% annual revenue growth rate over the next three years. This substantial expected growth aligns with NVIDIA's diversifying ventures in the automotive sector through partnerships with Toyota and Uber. With a current share price close to US$98.89, the consensus analyst price target of US$164.74 suggests a significant potential upside, being 40.0% higher. However, the target hinges on sustained earnings growth and efficiency gains, amidst uncertainty from regulatory and geopolitical challenges. As NVIDIA continues to solidify its position in multiple high-growth sectors, such technological alliances may bolster its prospects further.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN. Speaking at an event in Oklahoma City hosted by the Hamm Institute, Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president for global data centers, said recent chatter about Amazon Web Services scaling back on leases was simply a misunderstanding. Nothing's changed, he said, adding that Amazon's long-term growth expectations for AI infrastructure are still firmly in place. Nvidia's Josh Parker had a similar message. He said fears that newer, more efficient AI technology like China's DeepSeek could hurt demand were an overreaction. He called the investor response a kneejerk and said Nvidia is still seeing strong growth in AI computing needs. But while demand for AI keeps climbing, the industry is running into a new challenge: power. Jack Clark, co-founder of Anthropic, said the wave of new AI infrastructure could need around 50 gigawatts of extra electricity in the next few years about as much as building 50 nuclear plants. He called the scale of the demand unprecedented. To tackle the problem, executives suggested that natural gas could end up playing a major role in powering the next generation of AI data centers. For investors, the next big question will be how tech giants plan to keep their AI ambitions on track without hitting an energy wall. Viewinsider tradesat Amazon.

        "header": "Nvidia stock dips amid Reuters report on AI chip export rule review",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged lower, but remained higher by 0.5% as the market responded to a report from Reuters that Trump administration officials are considering changes to a Biden-era AI chip export rule. The potential revision could impact how advanced semiconductors are distributed globally, stirring a cautious reaction among investors. The current regulation, introduced by the U.S. Department of Commerce in January, categorizes countries into three tiers, determining their access to cutting-edge AI chips. The rule aims to maintain the most sophisticated computing power within the United States and amongst its allies, while restricting access to nations such as China and Russia. The regulation is set to take effect on May 15, requiring compliance from companies like Nvidia. However, Trump officials are now debating the removal of this tiered system in favor of a global licensing regime that could involve government-to-government agreements. This approach aligns with President Donald Trump\u2019s trade strategy, which emphasizes bilateral deals and could leverage access to U.S.-designed chips in negotiations. The proposed changes also include lowering the threshold for licensing exceptions. Presently, orders below approximately 1,700 of Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips are exempt from country caps and do not necessitate a license, only notification to the government. The Trump administration is contemplating reducing this cutoff to orders under 500 H100 chips. These potential policy shifts have brought uncertainty to the semiconductor industry, which has previously expressed concerns over the rule\u2019s implications. Critics argue that the restrictions could drive countries, particularly those in the second tier, to seek alternatives from China, which offers less regulated and more affordable options. The review of the AI chip export rule comes at a time when the geopolitical landscape and trade relations are particularly sensitive. The outcome of these discussions could have significant ramifications for Nvidia and the broader semiconductor sector, as access to advanced chips is a crucial component of technological development and national security strategies.

        "content": "For decades, theU.S. dollarhas served as the financial world's storm shelter. Financial turmoil traditionally sends Treasury yields down (a sign people are buying U.S. bonds) and the U.S. dollar up. Yet in the aftermath of Donald Trump's 2025tariffannouncements, investors were abandoning both\u2014at one point, the greenback plummeted 1.7% in a single day while 30-year Treasury rates spiked to almost 5.0%\u2014meaning people were fleeing U.S. government bonds, not seeking them as shelter from the storm. There have been previous bouts of stocks and the dollar declining together, such as during a 2011 U.S. credit rating downgrade and the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But monetary policy experts fear this isn't just a passing rainfall, that Trump administration moves antagonizing both the markets and long-time trading partners have generated a tsunami bearing down on global confidence in the American greenback\u2014which took generations of monetary and fiscal policy to build. \"We are in the midst of dramatic regime change in markets,\u201d Deutsche Bank (DB) analysts warned. Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay, said on Bluesky that \"confidence in the dollar may be collapsing.\"Should that happen, every American would feel it in their wallet. A crisis of confidence in the dollar is when global investors and foreigncentral banksquestion the stability of U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This goes beyond the usual fluctuations in currency exchange values; it would be far more fundamental. Since the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, the U.S. dollar has served as the world's primaryreserve currency. Central banks worldwide hold dollars to back their own currencies, and the dollar has long been the dominant medium of exchange in international trade. At the end of 2024, about 54% of global foreign-exchange reserves were held in dollars, demonstrating the currency's continued power, even as it has been declining in recent decades. In the turbulence triggered byTrump's tariff actions, Deutsche Bank analysts pointed to a \"simultaneous collapse in the price of all U.S. assets\"\u2014stocks, bonds, and dollars.This suggests investors may be questioning the dollar's foundational role in the global economy. The dollar weakened against nearly every major currency despite rising U.S. interest rates, whilegoldprices surged to record highs.Should the trend continue, a dramatic drop in the dollar's value would have immediate consequences for all Americans. Ade-dollarizationwould have major effects for American consumers: Diversifying into non-dollar assetslike foreign currencies, gold, and international stocks could help protect your finances from dollar instability. While there's no sugar-coating the effects on Americans if worldwide demand for American assets drops, there are strategies experts say can help protect you against dollar instability: The dollar's position as the world's reserve currency has given Americans significant advantages: lower interest rates, cheaper imported goods, and the ability to finance large government budget deficits at low interest. Even a gradual erosion of these advantages would affect everything from everyday purchases to retirement planning\u2014and a massive dollar crisis could wipe these advantages away completely.",

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. President Trump's evolving worldwide tariff policy has triggered a wave of revisions to economic forecasts over the past month. Among the changing forecasts is an increased chance of the United Statesentering a recession, and the prospect of inflation rising instead of falling\u2014leaving the Federal Reservein a tricky spoton deciding 2025 interest rates. Thankfully, not everything is uncertain. While stock market returns are down this month, and savings account rates can be reduced at any time,certificates of deposit (CDs)are one savings tool you can count on for a fixed and guaranteed return. Not only that, you can choose to lock that return in for a few months, for several years, or for virtually any duration that suits your personal timeline. A predictable rate is nothing special if the return is subpar, of course. But today's CDs are still near a historic peak. Having benefited from theFederal Reserve'saggressive rate-hike campaign of 2022\u20132023, the best CD rates are still offering mid-4% returns across all of the major terms. Today's top rate is 4.50%, available for CD terms ranging from 3 to 18 months\u2014which could guarantee yourannual percentage yield (APY)into late 2026. Alternatively, you could opt to secure a rate of either 4.28% or 4.32% that you can enjoy until 2027, 2028, or evenas long as 2030. Whether you have liquid savings in the bank or are considering moving some of your investments into cash, you're guaranteed to grow your balance with a CD. And because all of the options in our daily rankings of the best nationwide CDs are offered byFDIC-insuredbanks andNCUA-backedcredit unions, your money is also federally protected (up to $250,000 per person and per institution). CDs can boost what you earn over time by offering a fixed rate that the bank orcredit unioncan't lower. But there are certain smart strategies for making CDs work for you. First, you'll always want to keep some of your cash savings in a more liquid account, such as ahigh-yield savings account. That's because CDs, in exchange for their guaranteed rate, require you to keep your funds on deposit until the CD matures. Cash out early and you'll most likely be hit with anearly withdrawal penalty. But by keeping some reserve funds in a savings account, you can tap that money first in an emergency and perhaps save yourself from cashing in a CD prematurely. Can't commit to even a short-term CD? Though savings accounts don't offer rate guarantees, you can earn an excellent return from the top options right now. Today'sbest high-yield savings accountspay as much as 5.00%, with more than a dozen options paying at least 4.40%. Second, it's absolutely critical you shop around if you want to earn a competitive rate. Across all FDIC banks, the national average for a 1-year CD is just 1.77%.But by shopping our daily rankings of the best CDs, you can find more than a dozen options in the 1-year rangethat pay 4.35% to 4.50%. That's 2.5 times more than the national average. Third, consider opening more than one CD, splitting your funds across multiple certificates of different durations. Even if you aren't striving to create a full-fledgedCD ladder, spreading your money out over more than one CD, with different terms, means you'll have funds becoming available at various times\u2014which can perhaps help you avoid withdrawing funds from a longer-term certificate before it matures. Our last piece of advice is to act soon. According to theCME Group's FedWatch Toolat the time of this writing, financial markets are currently pricing in around 68% odds that we'll see Fed rate cuts totaling a full percentage point\u2014or even more\u2014by the end of 2025.Time will tell if that comes to pass, but any reduction by the central bank will push savings accounts and CD rates lower. So it's smart to lock in one oftoday's stellar rateswhile they're still available. We update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available: Note that the \"top rates\" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top buzzing stocks you should watch today. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC expressed surprise that the Republican administration could be this damaging to shareholders \u201cThese are hideous depressing days for the bulls. I\u2019m not used to seeing a White House that doesn\u2019t seem to care that it\u2019s causing the decline. It\u2019s dazzlingly counterintuitive to see a Republican in particular be so callous toward the shareholder class. After all historically that constituency has been very pro-Republican. It\u2019s a total blast zone out there and ground zero is tech.\u201d Cramer said that the tech selloff forced him to revisit his age-old mantra of \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d regarding two major technology stocks.

With each company, we have mentioned its latest hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC said major companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are seeing the effects of tariffs amid their huge exposure to China. Cramer believes the company is being \u201cpunished\u201d for doing business with the Asian country, which he believes is hostile to the US: \u201cI was working on my talk for the CNBC Investing Club last night, and it hit me like a bright bulb snapped on in a dark room. The real reason it is so hard for us to gain all these tariffs is that the company\u2019s now being punished. We\u2019re doing exactly what companies were supposed to do.\u201d The market will keep punishing Nvidia for not coming up to its gigantic (and sometimes unrealistic) growth expectations. About 50% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from large cloud providers, which are rethinking their plans amid the DeepSeek launch and looking for low-cost chips. Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC\u2019s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia\u2019s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses\u00a0 TSMC\u2019s 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offers alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node. Here is how Cramer explained what NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is going through in the tariff wars: \u201cNo country wants to be left behind by the industrial revolution, particularly one based on AI, right? And no country like China wants to be left behind. For Nvidia, China is the best kind of customer they could possibly have. I\u2019m sure that China would happily buy huge numbers of chips. They\u2019d probably buy all the chips. But what Nvidia didn\u2019t know was that it was selling its chips to an enemy nation. I don\u2019t blame them for not knowing because nobody knew, at least nobody was operating under the rules of either President Biden or the previous president, President Trump. China was very open for business under those two. Sure, in his first term, President Trump was no friend to the People\u2019s Republic of China, but he wasn\u2019t a rabid hater either. Then again, China did grow more opposition, although it\u2019s not like it was ever a secret that the PRC was an authoritarian dictatorship with global ambitions, sometimes antithetical to that of our own. Both parties now want to contain China.\u201d Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: \u201cNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance due to several factors. In January 2025, investor concerns grew regarding the emergence of advanced AI models from China, reportedly developed at lower costs and with reduced computing requirements, raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s market dominance. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of new tariffs targeting industries increased worries about higher operational costs. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia reported robust fiscal fourth-quarter results, highlighted by significant revenue growth driven by its data center segment. On the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the increasing computational requirements of future AI models, noting, \u201cThe more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer,\u201d and adding that future reasoning models could demand substantially more compute resources. We believe Nvidia\u2019s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure\u2014including advancements in inference and reasoning during inference\u2014continues to drive adoption among enterprises and startups, ensuring sustained demand for its high performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed and new clusters deployed, we see Nvidia as well-positioned to capitalize on rising computational needs across AI applications.\u201d Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of top buzzing stocks you should watch today. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Chinaimposed a 125% tariff on American productsin April, a response to the White House announcing a 145% tax on goods imported from China. \u201cWith China no longer essentially being available, we\u2019ve really had to pivot our business,\u201d Smith said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense. \u201cWhile it\u2019s important, we do believe we have other options.\u201d Smithfield executives expect there to be ample demand for pork that may have gone to China in the roughly 30 other markets where it exports. The company anticipates sales increasing year-over-year in the low- to mid-single digit percent range in 2025, CFO Mark Hall said. Still, the company acknowledged the possibility that tariffs will have side effects. In its 2024 annual report, it said that tariffs on pork exports could lead to higher domestic supply levels that weigh on prices. Besides focusing on other markets,Smithfield aims to bolster earningsby increasing its sales of its more profitable products, such as lunch meats and dry sausages, said Steven France, president of packaged meats. Smithfield reported $3.8 billion in sales for the quarter ended March 30, up 9.5% from the same period last year, according to its earnings report.Net income attributable to Smithfield increased more than 40% year-over-year to $224 million, the filing said. The stock rose nearly 9% on Tuesday, leaving it up about 3% this year despite a jagged run for the shares.",

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher Tuesday as President Donald Trump worked toalleviate some of the tariff burden for carmakers. The S&P 500 added 0.6%, securing its sixth consecutive day of gains. The Nasdaq also closed 0.6% higher, while the Dow was up 0.8%. SBA Communications (SBAC), a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on telecommunications infrastructure, posted better-than-expected first-quarter revenue, boosted by strength in its domestic leasing business. The firm also boosted its full-year outlook and announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase plan, and several analysts lifted their price target on the stock, highlighting an improving growth outlook. Shares of SBAC advanced 6.8%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock on Tuesday. Shares of computational software provider Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) climbed 5.8% following quarterly profit results that exceeded analysts' forecasts. Cadence also lifted its full-year sales and profit guidance, anticipating robust demand from semiconductor firms for its chip design products as the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies heats up. However, questions remain about the impact of tariffs on the company's business in China. Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), which makes barcode scanners and other devices designed to help businesses track their inventory, beat top- and bottom-line forecasts with its first-quarter result. Shares of Zebra Technologies were up 5.2% on Tuesday. Sherwin-Williams (SHW)\u00a0shares jumped 4.8% after the paint and coatings manufacturertopped earnings per share (EPS) estimatesfor the first quarter of 2025. Although revenue for the period fell short of expectations, pricing strength in the Paint Store Group, gross margin expansion, and successful cost-control measures helped drive profitability. Although NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) edged out first-quarter sales and profit expectations, the company announced that its chief executive officer (CEO) would step down at the end of the year. The provider of chips for the automotive market and other industries also pointed to an uncertain environment given potential tariff impacts. NXP shares dropped 6.9% on Tuesday, suffering the heaviest losses in the S&P 500. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) shares also tumbled 6.9% after the biotech firm'squarterly sales fell shy of estimates. Softness in revenue from Eylea, Regeneron's treatment for a variety of eye conditions, underpinned the company's overall sales miss. Insurance brokerage Brown & Brown (BRO) missed expectations for organic revenue growth, and its shares slipped 6.0%. However, the risk management specialist's adjusted profits came in ahead of consensus forecasts, boosted by gains in fees and commissions income.",

The S&P 500 fell more than 7% in the 100 calendar days\u201469 trading days, to be precise\u2014since Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, which concluded Tuesday. That\u2019s the worst post-inauguration performance for the index since Gerald Ford took office in August 1974, when stocks declined more than 11% after Nixon resigned amid astagflation recession. A president\u2019s impacton the economy and the stock market isn\u2019t always felt within their first 100 days in office\u2014if it\u2019s felt during their administration at all. But Trump has so far turned the US and global economies on their heads, raisingU.S. tariffsto their highest level in about a century and threatening the independence of the Federal Reserve, contributing to upheaval in financial markets worldwide. Consumer confidencehas plummeted, recession risks have risen, and business leaders are navigating a thick fog of uncertainty. Trump entered the White House with the stock market sailing, buoyed by hopes for corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and a flurry of mergers and acquisitions. Stocks hit a record high days after Trump's inauguration and hovered there for about a month before signs ofcratering consumer sentimentset off alarm bells on Wall Street. The stock market has since suffered itsworst rout in decades\u2014and one of itsbiggest ralliesin decades\u2014as the president has continued to ratchet up the uncertainty. The chaos has been more than some of the president's supporters bargained for. Executives who welcomed Trump's re-election, expecting four years of business and shareholder-friendly policies, have pushed back against the president's tariffs. Optimism among small business ownershas waned. And some of Trump's most vocal backers on Wall Street, frustrated with the president's tariffs, havecriticized the administrationon social media.",

Super Micro makes advanced AI servers that include NVIDIA chips. Super Micro said it now expects net sales for the quarter to be $4.5-$4.6 billion, down from its prior view of $5-$6 billion and the consensus of $5.41 billion. The company expects non-GAAP EPS for the quarter to be $0.29-$0.31, down from its prior view of $0.46-$0.52 and the consensus of $0.54. The company said that while new-generation product design wins were \"robust\", some delayed customer platform decisions moved sales into Q4. Further, the server maker said GAAP and Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 220 basis points lower than Q2 primarily due to higher inventory reserves resulting from older generation products and expedite costs to enable time-to-market for new products. In addition to the weakness in NVIDIA following the update, shares of Super Micro\u2019s rival, Dell (NYSE:DELL), fell 4.8% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.

        "content": "We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks Investors Are Monitoring After Tariff Shock. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks investors are monitoring after tariff shock. The tariff wars and a potential slowdown in AI spending threw water on investors\u2019 AI trade plans and outlook. However, many analysts believe the broader outlook of the industry is still strong. Ben Bajarin, Creative Strategies CEO, in a latest program on CNBC explained why he is still bullish on the Jensen Huang-led AI giant: \u201cI think when you look at the technology roadmap \u2026 in terms of what they\u2019re doing with Grace Blackwell and Blackwell systems going forward, it\u2019s going to be very, very hard for others to compete. I think they were extremely bullish about how much of the industry\u2014not just the traditional, you know, cloud servers but AI factories and this entirely new infrastructure\u2014and how it is being kind of redeveloped for the AI era. Like, it\u2019s not being built on other things. And so I think when you look at the ecosystem that\u2019s grown around them, they\u2019re deeply entrenched. It doesn\u2019t have any sign of that changing.\u201d Bajarin said that he sensed \u201cfrustration\u201d in Jensen Huang\u2019s tone as the executive feels Wall Street is not modeling the growth potential his company\u2019s AI products truely have. \u201cAnd he seems to think that nobody is modeling that in or really understands it. So there\u2019s the\u2014we kind of have a sense of what they\u2019ll sell just product-wise here in 2025, which is where I agree with you. Hard to surprise to the upside to move the stock, but I think he is signaling people don\u2019t understand the magnitude of this opportunity. And I think that\u2019s worth unpacking because there is a lot of growth ahead.\u201d READ ALSO7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 technology stocks Wall Street is closely watching these days. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Brad Gerstner, Altimeter Capital Founder & CEO, said in a latest program on CNBC that he is adding to his NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) position despite having a \u201cbomb shelter\u201d market posture. \u201cRemember we entered today in kind of bomb shelter positioning. We had puts on the NASDAQ, we had a tremendous number of shorts, and we were sitting in a lot of cash. We only had 50% of our long book even positioned in the market. So we\u2019re dramatically outperforming on a day like today. So we\u2019re going from the bomb shelter to simply, you know, our safety positioning. And that means adding about 15% of net exposure, and we\u2019re adding it in the areas that we believe we\u2019re continuing to see secular growth. And as you know, the growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts. You hear it from OpenAI, you hear it from Google, you hear it from Elon, you hear it from others. I know there\u2019s a debate about that, but that\u2019s the side of the debate that we\u2019re on. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC\u2019s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia\u2019s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses\u00a0 TSMC\u2019s 3nm process nodes. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offer alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node. Harding Loevner Global Developed Markets Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter: \u201cFor the full year, the composite\u2019s underperformance was primarily due to poor stock choices in the US.NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA), which we sold in the first quarter and repurchased in the fourth quarter, caused almost two-thirds of the strategy\u2019s underperformance. We were hurt by our underweight as NVIDIA\u2019s stock price soared during the first half of the year on the insatiable demand for the company\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), which enable generative Al computing. Overall, NVDAranks 3rdon our list of AI stocks investors are monitoring after tariff shock. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.
