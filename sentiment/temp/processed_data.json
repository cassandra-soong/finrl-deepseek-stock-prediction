        "content": "The accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) was largely credited with sparking the current bull market that has been running riot for more than two years. Over the past few months, however, investors have become increasingly concerned that the impact of tariffs and the potential for slowing adoption could stymie the rally that has lifted many AI stocks to new heights. TakeNvidia(NVDA-0.02%)for example. In the company's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 26), Nvidia delivered revenue of $39.3 billion, which soared 78% year over year, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89 soared 82%. While results of that magnitude would be enough to send most stocks soaring, Nvidia turned south and is down roughly 14% since the report was released. In the ensuing months, investors have been seeking assurances that AI adoption remains high. EnterAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-1.61%)CEO Lisa Su, who just delivered incredible news for Nvidia investors. Image source: Getty Images. AMD reported its first-quarter results after market close on Tuesday, and investors were pleasantly surprised. The chipmaker generated record revenue of $7.4 billion, up 36% year over year, while its adjusted EPS of $0.96 jumped 55%. To put those results in context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $7.12 billion and EPS of $0.93, so AMD cleared both hurdles with room to spare. The biggest contributor to the results was strength from AMD's data center segment, as revenue of $3.7 billion jumped 57% year over year. The client and gaming segment delivered revenue of $2.9 billion, up 28%. While client revenue of $2.3 billion rallied 68%, gaming revenue of $647 million remained in a secular slump, down 30%. The company also boasted an expanding gross margin of 50%, up 300basis pointsfrom 47% in the prior year quarter, thanks to higher data center revenue and a favorable product mix. AMD also provided a robust outlook for the second quarter, forecasting revenue of $7.4 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, well ahead of the $7.24 billion predicted by analysts. Of the results, CEO Lisa Su said (emphasis mine), \"We delivered an outstanding start to 2025 as year-over-year growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by strength in our core businesses andexpanding data center and AI momentum.\" That news bodes well for Nvidia. Beyond the good news for AMD investors, the results have broader implications across the tech space. Over the past couple of years, the pace at whichgenerative AIhas evolved has been dizzying, adoption remains high, and the availability of the technology has never been greater. Recent commentary from every corner of big tech suggests thebuildout of data centersneeded to support the technology continues at a frantic pace. So, what does this have to do with Nvidia? The company is the leading provider ofgraphics processing units (GPUs)that speed AI through the ether. While estimates vary, Nvidia controlled as much as 98% of the data center GPU market over the past couple of years. While the competition has increased, the market continues to grow, making Nvidia the odds-on favorite to profit from this once-in-a-generation paradigm shift. The popular narrative in recent months has been that the adoption of AI is slowing, despite evidence to the contrary. Most experts suggest that AI will generate trillions of dollars over the coming five to 10 years, but estimates vary wildly. The generative AI market is expected to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence. McKinsey & Company is even more bullish, calculating that generative AI could add the equivalent of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy over the coming decade. Not to be outdone, Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) values the potential contribution of generative AI to the global economy at $15.7 trillion by 2030. The twin takeaways from this exercise are that no one knows for sure how big generative AI will ultimately be, and the market opportunity is significant. Fears about the slowing adoption of AI, the uncertainty wrought by global tariffs, anda moratorium on sales to Chinahave weighed heavily on Nvidia, with the stock down 16% (as of this writing) since the start of 2025. The falling stock price, combined with the company's accelerating profits, creates a compelling opportunity for investors, as Nvidia is selling for just 26 times forward earnings, an attractive price for a company at theheart of the AI revolution.",

        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares gained ground in extended trading on Tuesday after the chipmaker postedfirst-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Sales in the company\u2019s data center segment surged 57% in the quarter, helping to allay concerns of a slowdown inAI spendingamid uncertainty about what impact the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs will have on global growth. However, the chipmaker cautioned that its results would be affected by charges of roughly $800 million related totightening export restrictions on sales of its chips to China. Through Tuesday's close, AMD shares had gained 18% since the start of the year and risen nearly 30% from their April low, far outpacing the performance of theS&P 500over those periods. The stock rose 1.7% to $100.32 in after-hours trading Tuesday. Below, we take a closer look at AMD\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. AMD shares have trended lower within adescending channelsince October last year, tagging the pattern\u2019s upper and lower trendlines on multiple occasions since that time. More recently, the stock has rallied toward the channel\u2019s upper trendline and50-day moving average, two indicators that provided significant resistance on the chart in late March. Meanwhile, therelative strength index (RSI)has recently crossed back above the 50 threshold ahead of the chipmaker\u2019s earnings report to signal improving price momentum. Let\u2019s point out several majorsupport and resistancelevels on AMD\u2019s chart that may come into play. The first lower level to watch sits around $93. This area on the chart may provide support near the prominent October 2023 low, which also closely aligns with a period oftradingactivity toward the end of last month. A failure of bulls to defend this important technical level could see the shares drop to lower support at $78. Investors may seekbuy-and-holdopportunities in this region near the stock\u2019sbear trapApril low. Upon an earnings-driven move higher, it\u2019s worth eyeing the crucial $116 level. The shares may face selling pressure in this area near ahorizontal linethat connects the December 2023 retracement low with peaks that formed on the chart in February and March this year. It\u2019s worth pointing out this level also sits at the 38.2%Fibonacci retracementlevel when applying a grid from the October high to April low.

        "header": "Prediction: 5 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Since the start of 2023, there hasn't been a hotter trend on Wall Street than the evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI). Empowering software and systems with tools that allow them to reason and act on their own, and potentially even learn new jobs and skillsets without the need for human oversight, is a game-changing innovation with abigaddressable market. While estimates of just how much AI can contribute to economic growth are all over the map, PwC pegged its global addressable market at a cool $15.7 trillion by 2030. If the actual impact of artificial intelligence is anywhere in the ballpark of this figure, there are going to be multiple winners. Image source: Getty Images. Thus far, no company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI thanNvidia(NVDA-0.02%). Its valuation climbed from $360 billion to end 2022 to well north of $3 trillion in less than two years. Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) and next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture have been the preferred chips used by businesses wanting to be on the leading edge of AI innovation. Butthere's also a realistic chance Nvidia is in a bubble, which would allow other influential businesses nipping at its heels to leapfrog it in the valuation department. To begin with, there hasn't been a game-changing innovation, technology, or trend for more than three decadesthat's avoided a bubble-bursting event in its early expansion phase. This is to say that investors frequently overestimate early adoption rates and the broad-based utility of highly touted technologies and innovations. Eventually, it leads to lofty expectations not being met. If an AI bubble were to form and burst, it would undoubtedly hit Nvidia stock hard. Competition is also mounting in the AI-GPU space --albeit from an unlikely source. Though direct competitors are ramping up production of high-powered chips for enterprise data centers, the biggest worry might be that most of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing chips of their own to use in their data centers. Even if these AI-GPUs lack the compute potential of Nvidia's hardware, they'll be notably cheaper and not backlogged. There's a very real possibility of Nvidia losing out on future orders, or at the very least losing its premium pricing power. I'd expect these headwinds to weigh down Nvidia stock over the coming three years andallow the following five companies to surpass its market cap. Note, I'm excludingMicrosoftandApplesince their market caps are already higher than Nvidia, as of this writing. The likeliest of all companies to surpass Nvidia's valuation at some point over the next three years is e-commerce colossusAmazon(AMZN-0.48%). I'd argue Amazon is on a trajectory that couldmake it the largest publicly traded company by the turn of the decade. While most people are familiar with Amazon because of its globally dominant online marketplace,its growth engine is primarily tied to its cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS accounted for a third of all cloud infrastructure service spend during the fourth quarter of 2024, based on estimates from Canalys. More importantly, it's growing by a high-teens percentage on a year-over-year basis, with $117 billion in high-margin, annual run-rate sales. Amazon's other high-growth ancillary segments aren't slouches, either. Being one of the premier social media destinations has made it an advertising rockstar. Even in a challenging economic environment, advertising services revenue is climbing by nearly 20% on a constant-currency basis. When coupled with the exceptional pricing power of Prime subscriptions, Amazon has the tools to generate outsized cash flow growth over the next three-to-five years, if not well beyond. Google parentAlphabet(GOOGL-0.42%)(GOOG-0.34%)is a second stock that has the catalysts to leapfrog Nvidia in the next three years. Similar to Amazon,Alphabet is leaning on its cloud infrastructure service platform(Google Cloud) to ramp up its growth potential and operating cash flow. Google Cloud is incorporating artificial intelligence to give its clients access to generative AI solutions and large language model tools. This high-margin segment has been recurringly profitable for Alphabet since 2023, and is generating around $49 billion in annual run-rate sales, as of the March-ended quarter. But even though Alphabet is relying on AI to supercharge its high-margin growth rate, it has a foundational cash cow to fall back on in the event the AI bubble bursts.Google operates as a near-monopoly in global internet search, with just shy of a 90% share, as of April 2025, per GlobalStats. Disproportionately long economic growth cycles, coupled with Google's near-monopoly status, makes this segment a sustainable cash generator for Alphabet. Image source: Getty Images. If there's such a thing as a logical choice to surpass Nvidia's market cap in the coming three years,social media titanMeta Platforms(META-1.84%)certainly fits the bill. Meta is an ad-driven business -- even more so than Alphabet. Whereas the latter generated 74% of its net sales in the March-ended quarter from advertising, Meta's social media destinations brought in just shy of 98% of its $42.3 billion in total revenue from ads in the first quarter. No other social media company is particularly close to attracting the 3.43 billion daily active people that Meta averaged in March 2025. Having ultra-popular platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messengerensures that businesses will pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of users. Meta Platforms is also sitting on an enviable treasure chest of capital. It closed out March with $70.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as generated north of $24 billion in net cash from operations in the first three months of 2025. This cash affords Meta the luxury of slow-stepping the development of potentially game-changing innovations, such as the metaverse. Though it's the longshot on this list, based on its current market cap of \"just\" $666 billion, payment facilitatorVisa(V-0.08%)has the necessary catalysts to leapfrog Nvidia, when combined with the latter's headwinds. Visa's sustained double-digit sales and earnings growth rate is a function of its being the dominant player in payment processing domestically, as well as having a potentially multidecade expansion runway in overseas markets. According to data collected by eMarketer,Visa handled about $6.45 trillion in credit card network purchase volume domestically in 2023. This was nearly $2.4 trillion more than No.'s 2 through 4 in market share,combined. Aside from generating consistent merchant fees in the U.S.,cross-border payment volume has been continually growing by a double-digit percentage. Visa has the capital and cash flow to organically or acquisitively enter faster-growing (and chronically underbanked) emerging markets.  Berkshire Hathaway's Class A stock (BRK.A) has delivered a nearly 20% annualized return spanning 60 years.BRK.Adata byYCharts. Last but certainly not least, I fully expect the steady tortoise to beat the hare. While Nvidia's stock went parabolic in 2023 and 2024, it's Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway(BRK.A0.06%)(BRK.B0.18%)that's managed a nearly 20% annualized return over six decades. If Berkshire stuck to this trajectory, it could become a $2 trillion company by the midpoint of 2028. One of the reasons Berkshire Hathaway is such a success is Buffett favoriting cyclical businesses. Whether it's companies he's acquired or invested in, the Oracle of Omaha favors businesses that ebb-and-flow with the U.S. economy. Buffett rightly recognizes that, even though recessions are inevitable,economic expansions last significantly longer than downturns. Thus, he's positioned Berkshire's investment portfolio and five dozen owned businesses to take advantage of these lengthy periods of U.S. growth. Additionally, Warren Buffett loves putting Berkshire's cash to work in companies with robust capital-return programs. Berkshire Hathaway should have no trouble collecting in excess of $5 billion in dividend income over the next year. InThe Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future, the researchers at Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, showed thatdividend stocks crushed non-payers in the return columnover the last 51 years (1973-2024): 9.2% (annualized) for dividend stocks vs. 4.31% (annualized) for non-payers. Relying on dividend stocks suggests Berkshire's investment portfolio is going to outperform over the long run.",

        "header": "Tariff Turmoil Put Nvidia to a Test: Top Customers Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft Just Showed Us Whether the Chip Giant Passed or Failed.",
        "content": "Nvidia's(NVDA-0.02%)earnings have soared quarter after quarter thanks to the great demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) products and services. The company is the world's leading designer of AI chips -- known as graphics processing units (GPUs) -- and has used this position as a springboard to create an entire portfolio that supports companies throughout their AI journey. This AI powerhouse serves a variety of players, from small start-ups to market giants across industries. But in recent times, investors have worried about Nvidia's revenue potential in the coming quarters. This is amid concern about possible weakness in the general economy -- something that may lead AI customers to cut back on spending. The risk intensified last month when President Donald Trump announced a plan to put in place a set of tariffs on imports from around the world. The concern is this will increase prices of items at home, weighing on consumers' wallets and companies' earnings. This potential hurdle put Nvidia to a test: Would its top customers, seeing the risk of a slowdown ahead, cut spending on AI and therefore on Nvidia's chips? These tech giants, during their recent earnings reports, just showed us whether Nvidia passed or failed. Image source: Getty Images. First, a quick note on Nvidia's customers. The company doesn't directly identify these players, but it's believed thatMicrosoft(MSFT-0.33%),Amazon(AMZN-0.48%),Alphabet(GOOG-0.34%)(GOOGL-0.42%), andMeta Platforms(META-1.84%)are among them. These tech giants spend billions of dollars annually on Nvidia's GPUs to build out their AI platforms -- and in the case of cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Alphabet's Google Cloud, they also offer Nvidia products and services to their customers. These tech giants all face a certain degree of impact on future earnings prospects from Trump's tariff plan -- though it's too early to determine this impact, since final tariff levels haven't been set. The president, after announcing his initial tariff plan, put this plan on pause to offer countries time to negotiate trade deals with the U.S. Meanwhile, he also temporarily exempted electronics products from the tariffs. So, right this minute, tariffs don't represent a hurdle for tech players -- though tariffs likely will become a headwind in the months to come. Trump has said he aims to determine a tariff level specifically for imported electronics products. All this could result in technology companies reining in spending -- even as early as today, with the idea that this potential earnings headwind is just ahead. But in their latest earnings reports, Nvidia's top reported customers didn't cut AI spending, instead emphasizing plans to keep investing in this booming technology. Microsoft reiterated its earlier forecast for capital spending to support demand for AI. And chief executive officer Satya Nadella said something interesting that reinforces the idea of AI spending even during difficult economic times: \"Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth.\" So companies, to focus on efficiency and growth, actually might favor AI spending when the economic environment looks tough. Alphabet reiterated that it plans$75 billion in capital spendingthis year and said its strong relationship with Nvidia is a \"key advantage.\" Meta increased its capital spending outlook for the year to the range of $64 billion to $72 billion from the $60 billion to $65 billion range -- and AI spending remains a big part of this. Finally, Amazon said it continues to \"invest very aggressively in AI.\" So it's clear that Nvidia's customers, now well aware of any potential tariff and economic risks ahead, still are continuingtheir AI investmentsas planned. And they also remain optimistic about the potential of the technology to greatly improve a company's operations and even lower costs. All this is fantastic news for Nvidia and its shareholders, as it shows these top customers, even against a tumultuous economic backdrop, refuse to slow down their AI spending plans. And this means we should expect ongoing growth from Nvidia as these customers continue to seek out top-performing chips. Of course, tariffs remain a risk, and any extreme decision in this area could represent a headwind for tech players including Nvidia. But so far, in this test of potential earnings strength down the road, technology giants just showed us that Nvidia passed with flying colors.",

        "header": "1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars Into the $4 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The $4 trillion club is yet to be established, but there are three candidates with a realistic chance of becoming the founding member: Microsoft is the closest to the mark, and its business is also growing much faster than Apple's business, thanks primarily to the strength of its Azure cloud platform. Nvidia might be much further away from a $4 trillion valuation, but it could legitimately achieve the milestone before Microsoft and Apple because of how quickly its artificial intelligence (AI) chips for data centers are selling. While we don't know which company will get there first, I think Microsoft has the greatest potential to not only join the $4 trillion club in the future, but stay there as well. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Since 2019, Microsoft invested around $14 billion inOpenAI, which is the leading AI start-up behind ChatGPT. Microsoft combined OpenAI's latest AI models with its own to create the Copilot virtual assistant, which is now integrated into the company's flagship software products like Windows, Bing, and Edge, for free. But Copilot is also available for subscribers of the 365 productivity suite (which includes applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) for an additional monthly fee. Organizations around the world pay for over 400 million 365 licenses for their employees, and all of them are eligible for the Copilot upgrade, so the virtual assistant could be a major source ofrecurring revenuefor Microsoft in the future. During its fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended March 31), Microsoft said there were hundreds of thousands of organizations using Copilot for 365 around the world, which was upthreefoldfrom the year-ago period. CEO Satya Nadella said a record number of customers opted to buy more licenses during the quarter, and he said deal size continues to grow. The company rolled out new Copilot features during Q3 to encourage more 365 subscribers to upgrade, including deep reasoning agents called Researcher and Analyst. Researcher scans internal data and the internet to help employees develop business strategies and create reports, whereas Analyst can turn raw spreadsheet data into demand forecasts and revenue projections. These tools have the potential to save employees hours of manual work, taking their productivity to new levels. Azure is Microsoft'scloud computingplatform, which offers businesses hundreds of solutions to help them transition into the digital age. But it also became a go-to destination for businesses seeking the computing power and ready-madelarge language models(LLMs) they need to create and deploy AI software. Microsoft accounts for itsAIcloud revenue under its Azure AI segment, and it's becoming an increasingly important driver of Azure's overall growth. During the fiscal 2025 third quarter, Azure revenue grew by 33% year over year, and Azure AI accounted for a record-high 16 percentage points (almost half) of that figure.  Microsoft is rapidly building more infrastructure and buying truckloads of AI chips fromleading suppliers like Nvidiain order to meet demand. The company opened new data centers in 10 countries in the third quarter alone, but it has a long way to go. In fact, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said Microsoft has an order backlog worth an eye-popping $315 billion from customers who need more computing capacity. In other words, Azure AI revenue has a very long runway for growth -- but capturing it won't be cheap. Microsoft allocated $21.4 billion tocapital expenditures(capex) during the third quarter, most of which went toward data center infrastructure. It places the company on track to spend over $80 billion for the full fiscal year, and Nadella says that figure is likely to grow in fiscal 2026. Microsoft stock is trading at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 33.6 as of this writing, which is almost exactly in line with its 10-year average. Moreover, it's sitting roughly between Apple stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 31.9, and Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 38.9. In other words, Microsoft is probably fairly valued at the current level.  MSFT PE Ratiodata byYCharts. If we assume Microsoft's P/E ratio remains constant, the company will have to grow itsearnings per share(EPS) by 23.5% to justify amarket capof $4 trillion. Since it grew its EPS by an average of 16.2% per year in the last decade (between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2024), it could get there in around 18 months from now. However, Microsoft is growing its EPS below trend at the moment, partly because of its enormous data center spending which is weighing on its profitability. According to Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance), the company could increase its earnings by 12.8% in fiscal 2026. If it repeats that result in fiscal 2027, then a $4 trillion valuation might be around two years away, despite the elevated capex spending. Therefore, while it's impossible to know which company will reach the milestone first, I think Microsoft has a great chance to join the $4 trillion club in the near future. Plus, its recurring revenue streams from products like 365 and Copilot, combined with Azure AI's enormous $315 billion customer backlog, could ensure that the company stays there for the long term.",

        "content": "Uncertainty on Wall Street is at its highest level in years, but you wouldn't have known it watching the stock market last week. The S&P 500 rose for a ninth straight session on Friday, its longest winning streak since 2004, after astrong jobs reportand signs of cooling U.S.-China tensions eased Wall Street\u2019s worst tariff fears. Friday\u2019s session also completely erased all of the index\u2019s losses since President Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement on April 2tanked global markets. That stocks completely rebounded from April's rout struck some on Wall Street as odd, considering the murky outlook. Though most of Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs are paused until early July, duties on Chinese goodsremain prohibitively high, andthe clock is tickingfor the White House to negotiate dozens of trade deals. Plus, nearly all U.S. imports are now subject to a global 10% tariff that went into effect on April 9. Stocks havelost ground to start this weekas investors await new developments on tariffs, amid lingering concerns about the impact the levies will have on the economy and corporate profits. The recent rally, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note on Monday, has been driven by \u201cincrementally positive developments in 2 of the 4 items on our checklist for a more durable rally,\" namely, optimism about de-escalation with China and an improving earnings outlook. Stocksjumpedafter Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the U.S.-China trade war \"unsustainable,\u201d stoking optimism for a de-escalation.

The S&P 500 is on track to report profits grew by more than 10% last quarter, and several market-driving narratives\u2014insatiable AI demand, for example\u2014remain intact. Morgan Stanley thinks that two other criteria will need to be met to maintain the rally: 1. The U.S. and China will need to reach a trade deal that reassures investors and businesses that \"de-escalation\" is more than just lip service; and 2. Fed officials will need to signal they\u2019rewilling to cut interest ratesto support growth. \u201cEquity returns can be quite strong in alate cyclebackdrop where economic growth is slowing,\u201d which is likely where we are today, according to Morgan Stanley, \u201cbut this type of environment tends to happen only when a moredovish reactionfunction from the Fed starts to get priced.\u201d Unfortunately for the optimists in the room, Morgan Stanley\u2019s prognosis comes with a big asterisk: \u201cIt's worth noting that our economists don't see the Fed cutting rates this year (i.e., this is a tough needle to thread).\u201d The Fed's policy committeewraps up a two-day meeting Wednesdayand is widelyexpected to leave its benchmark rate unchanged.

        "content": "Shares ofAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-1.61%)rose 1.8% in Tuesday's after-hours trading, following the chipmaker's release of its first-quarter 2025 report. The stock's gain is attributable to the first quarter's revenue and earnings, along with the second-quarter revenue guidance, all coming in higher than Wall Street had expected. Image source: Getty Images. Data source: Advanced Micro Devices.GAAP= generally accepted accounting principles. YOY = year over year. Investors should focus on the adjusted numbers, which exclude one-time items. Wall Street was looking for adjusted EPS of $0.93 on revenue of $7.12 billion, so AMD exceeded both expectations. It also surpassed its own revenue guidance of $7.1 billion. (It doesn't issue a profit outlook.) In the quarter, AMD generated cash of $939 million running its operations, up 80% from the year-ago period. It ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $7.3 billion, up from $5.1 billion in the prior quarter. The company ended the period with long-term debt of $3.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion in the prior quarter. This increase is due to the company issuing about $1.5 billion in debt to help fund its ZT Systems acquisition. In March, AMD closed on its $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT Systems, which it describes as a \"leading provider ofAI[artificial intelligence] and general-purpose compute infrastructure for the world's largest hyperscale providers.\" AMD has said this acquisition will enable it to provide end-to-end AI solutions for data centers.Nvidia's massive growth in recent years is due to its expertise in such rack-scale data center AI solutions. Flat Data source: Advanced Micro Devices. *Client and gaming is a single reportable segment; I broke the two parts out for better clarity. YOY = year over year. QOQ = quarter over quarter. Data center growth was driven by robust demand for the company's EPYC central processing units (CPUs) and its Instinct graphics processing units (GPUs), which enable AI capabilities. On the earnings call, CEO Lisa Su expounded on the data center AI business: Turning to our data center AI business, revenue increased by a significant double-digit percentage year over year, as MI325X shipments ramp to support new enterprise and cloud deployments. More than 35 MI300-series platforms are in production from all the leading service providers, supporting the expanding number of Instinct GPU deployments with cloud, enterprise, and AI customers. Client revenue surged 68% year over year primarily due to strong demand for the latest Zen 5 Ryzen processors and a more favorable product mix. This segment sells chips for personal computers (PCs). Gaming revenue was down 30% year over year primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue. For Q2, management guided for: Going into the report, Wall Street had been modeling for Q2 revenue of $7.24 billion, so AMD's outlook beat this estimate. As for the export controls mentioned above, in April, the U.S. government expanded its restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips to China and select other countries, citing national and international security reasons. These controls essentially ban AMD from selling its Instinct MI308 GPU to these markets.Nvidia's H20 GPU, which it had specially designed for the China market, was also affected by the expanded export controls. For full-year 2025, AMD expects the hit to its revenue from the new export regulations to be about $1.5 billion, Hu said on the call. AMD turned in great first-quarter results. It's a particularly positive sign that adjusted EPS growth remains notably more robust than revenue growth, reflecting the company's expanding profit margin. Second-quarter revenue growth guidance of 27% is very solid, especially given the loss of sales of the MI308 chip to the Chinese market.",

        "header": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2030",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major tailwind for technology businesses over the last couple of years. But just how big of a factor is the AI boom for the world's largest enterprises? Consider semiconductor powerhouseNvidia(NVDA-0.02%)as a prime example. Exactly two years ago, Nvidia's market capitalization was $700 billion. Today, it is worth north of $2.7 trillion -- trailing onlyMicrosoftandAppleas theworld's most valuable companies. Over those same two years, e-commerce and cloud computing behemothAmazon(AMZN-0.48%)added just shy of $1 trillion to its own market value. While Amazon trails Nvidia's valuation today, I think the company could be worth much more than the semiconductor giant by next decade. Let's explore how Amazon's business is transforming thanks to the AI revolution. More importantly, I'll break down why I think the stock is a no-brainer buying opportunity right now for investors to buy and hold for the long term. Amazon reports its revenue across six major categories: online stores (e-commerce), physical stores, third-party seller services, advertising, subscriptions, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). E-commerce, brick-and-mortar storefronts, and third-party seller services all touch the retail industry where Amazon has its roots. Over the years, the company did a good job of branching out beyond retail and getting involved in higher-margin opportunities through advertising, Prime subscriptions, and cloud computing (AWS). While AI has the potential to disrupt all of Amazon's operational segments, AWS and retail are the two that have me most encouraged. On the retail side, Amazon is investing heavily inAI robotics. Essentially, the company is outfitting its fulfillment centers with robotic processes that can bring a new level of automation and efficiency to packaging and shipping services. In turn, Amazon should be able to reduce labor costs in its warehouses over time, resulting in greater profitability for its core retail operation. Over the last couple of years, AWS has been going through something of a renaissance thanks to its $8 billion investment into AI start-upAnthropic. Amazon first partnered with Anthropic in September 2023. At the end of 2023's third quarter, AWS was operating at a $92 billion annual revenuerun rateand with an operating income margin of roughly 30%. As of the end of 2025's first quarter, AWS' revenue run rate is over $117 billion while its operating income margin is nearly 39%. That combination of accelerating revenue and widening profit margins is lucrative. Amazon is also making some major moves to bolster the AWS platform -- notably through the development ofcustom chipsetsand heavy investments in data center infrastructure. Image Source: Getty Images. Amazon is in the early phases of developing its own AI chips. Its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohortsMicrosoft,Meta Platforms, andAlphabetare pursuing similar ambitions. While I don't think this will be catastrophic for Nvidia, it likely won't help it in the long run. As it stands today, each of these megacap technology companies works closely with Nvidia. But as more high-end AI chip options enter the market, theoretically, these businesses won't need to rely on Nvidia as heavily. Already, its chipmaking rivalAdvanced Micro Deviceshas already been able to win over the likes ofOracle, Meta, and Microsoft as major buyers of its own competing GPUs, so investors might want to prepare for less robust growth in Nvidia's sales and profits down the road. If the introduction of more chips that rival its GPUs ends up becoming a headwind for Nvidia, and if its revenue and profit gains become less inspiring for growth investors, then I think it's highly likely that the company's valuation multiples could compress. On the flip side, Amazon appears to be in the early stages of taking advantage of new opportunities for accelerated growth, particularly in AWS and its retail marketplaces. Nevertheless, Amazon's valuation trends suggest that investors are not yet placing much of a premium at all on the company's efficiency improvements or their long-run potential. When you account for how much the company's operating profits have grown over the last several years relative to its market cap gains,Amazon looks dirt cheap. If it keeps up its current trajectory, though, the company should be in a position to continue accelerating sales while minting billions in cash flow in the process. This has me optimistic that Amazon's valuation could begin to witness notable expansion over the next several years relative to peers such as Nvidia -- ultimately becoming a much larger company by 2030.",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence(AI) may be the most transformative technological revolution since the advent of the internet. Economic forecasts project that AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, fundamentally reshaping industries from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and entertainment. Unlike previous technological shifts, AI's unique capacity for autonomous learning, decision-making, and problem-solving creates exponential value across virtually every sector of the economy. This unprecedented economic potential has ignited a global race for AI dominance among corporations and nations alike. Image source: Getty Images. For investors seeking exposure to this technological revolution, the following five companies represent compelling opportunities. Read on to find out more about these incredible AI pioneers. Advanced Micro Devices(AMD1.80%)is gaining ground onNvidiawith its new MI325X AI accelerator, boasting massive memory bandwidth and strong generative AI performance.Microsoftplans to deploy the chip across its Azure cloud, giving AMD a powerful boost in visibility and adoption. With demand for AI infrastructure surging and AMD offering a more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's H100 and H200, this stock stands out as a high-upside pick in the accelerating AI race. Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN-0.48%)continues to lead in AI infrastructure through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division, which reported $29.3 billion in revenue for first-quarter 2025, marking a 17% year-over-year increase. AWS has expanded its AI offerings with its Nova family of models, including Nova Premier for complex reasoning tasks and Nova Sonic for speech-to-speech applications, enhancing its capabilities across both text and multimodal AI domains. In the consumer space, Amazon has integrated generative AI features across its platforms, with Nova Sonic already powering elements of Alexa+ and the widely available Rufus shopping assistant. Nova Sonic particularly stands out for its ability to understand speech in different speaking styles while generating natural-sounding responses, with Amazon claiming it achieves 46.7% better accuracy than competing models in noisy environments and maintains lower operating costs. With AWS positioned to grow beyond a \"multi-$100-billion-dollar revenue run rate business\" due to AI, according to CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon remains exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for AI solutions across both enterprise and consumer markets. ASML Holding N.V.(ASML-0.24%)is the sole manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are critical for producing the most advanced semiconductors used in AI applications. These machines enable the creation of chips with extremely fine features, essential for high-performance AI processing. ASML's unique position in the semiconductor supply chain makes it a pivotal player in the AI industry, regardless of which chip designers lead the market. Its functional monopoly on EUV lithography also gives the company a formidable economic moat. Applied Digital Corporation(APLD-1.54%)develops high-performance data centers tailored for AI workloads. These facilities are built to support dense deployments ofgraphics processing units(GPUs), which are essential for large-scale model training and inference. The company is expanding aggressively, with new campuses engineered for energy efficiency and advanced cooling. As demand for AI compute surges across sectors, Applied Digital is positioned to benefit by providing scalable, cost-effective infrastructure to enterprise and cloud clients. This makes it a compelling infrastructure-level play in the AI buildout. Meta Platforms, Inc.(META-1.84%)has shifted from an AI underdog to a front-runner with the release of its Llama 4 family of open-source models. The company's new multimodal systems -- Llama 4 Scout and Maverick -- can process text, images, video, and audio, and a larger \"Behemoth\" model is in training to rival the best in class. This surge in AI development is translating to real-world results. Meta AI now serves nearly 1 billion monthly active users across all Meta platforms combined, while WhatsApp's total user base exceeds 3 billion monthly users. WhatsApp has emerged as the primary platform where users engage with Meta AI, driving most one-on-one AI interactions. In April 2025, Meta launched a stand-alone Meta AI app, signaling its intent to compete head-on with OpenAI andAlphabet. The bottom line? Meta is well-positioned to lead in consumer AI -- and that fact makes its stock an attractive buy right now.",

Jefferies dropped its price target to $100 from $120, while maintaining a \"hold\" rating for the stock.\"AI growth is the primary metric for the stock and on that front estimates move lower,\" the analysts said. On the company's earnings call, CFO Jean Hu said AMD would take a $1.5 billion revenue hit in 2025 related to limits on sales of its chips to China. Overall, AMD projected second-quarter revenue of $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion. Analysts had called for $7.3 billion. AMD shares were up about 1% at just under $100 in premarket trading Wednesday, close to Jefferies' updated target. Citi analysts maintained a similar $100 target, noting that while AMD's AI revenue is expected to fall in the first half of the year, \"almost every other company has its AI business increasing.\" Meanwhile, Wedbush moved higher to $120 from $115 and UBS jumped to a more bullish $155 from $150.Wedbush pointed to the success of AMD's compute and gaming segments, which \"significantly outperformed\" in the quarter.",

        "header": "Are Trade Deficits Inherently Bad?",
        "content": "When the Trump administration imposed significant tariffs and thus additional taxes Americans must pay on many imported goods in April 2025, it justified the move by citing trade deficits with long-time trading partners, including China, the European Union, and Japan. The approach treats bilateral trade deficits\u2014where the U.S. buys more goods from a specific country than it sells to them\u2014as evidence that Americans, in the words of President Donald Trump, are being \u201cripped off\u201d or providing \"subsidies\" to other countries. Like most economists, William D. Lastrapes, professor of economics at the University of Georgia, takes issue with this framing. \"International trade deficits are not inherently bad. Trade surpluses are not inherently good,\" he told Investopedia. \"Imbalances in international trade naturally arise from voluntary exchange across national borders when factors of production in one country have a comparative advantage over factors in another country.\" Atrade deficitoccurs when a country imports more goods than it exports. A country's position as a global consumer, itscomparative advantagesin production, its role in global supply chains, and the strength of its currency all contribute to trade balances. Countries with trade surpluses, such as China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, tend to be significant exporters of natural resources that have comparatively low domestic consumption rates. Those, like the U.S., that have a consumption-based economy typically have deficits with such countries. However, few would argue that the U.S. isn't the far stronger, more diversified economy in these relationships. In addition, the deficit statistics themselves can be highly misleading. The U.S. runs significant trade surpluses with countries like the Netherlands and Singapore, not because their citizens consume more American products, but because these nations serve as major ports that distribute American goods throughout Europe and Asia. Similarly, products are now manufactured globally across multiple countries, making country-of-origin designations increasingly arbitrary. For example, a smartphone assembled in Vietnam using Chinese components, Korean displays, American software, and Japanese camera modules might count technically as a Vietnamese export when imported to the U.S., artificially inflating the bilateral deficit with Vietnam. \"Economically, the geographic location or nationality of buyer and seller is irrelevant and arbitrary,\" Lastrapes said. When a country runs a trade deficit, it typically reflects strong consumer purchasing power and robusteconomic growth. The U.S. has had an impressive economic expansion for decades while simultaneously running trade deficits, demonstrating that the two can coexist (see the charts on this page for U.S.real GDPgrowth and the U.S. trade balance). Importantly, trade deficits provide American consumers with lower-priced goods and greater variety. This increases purchasing power, especially for middle- and lower-income households, who benefit from more affordable products.Trade deficits are also counterbalanced bycapital accountsurpluses, meaning foreign countries invest their export earnings (often paid in U.S. dollars) back into the U.S. economy through real estate, businesses, stocks, bonds, and other investments. This influx of foreign capital helps fund American business expansion, reduces interest rates, and supports economic growth. \"U.S. trade deficits caused by profitable opportunities for investment in the U.S. allow wealth to grow without sacrificing current spending,\" Lastrapes said. \"Growth in productive capacity means that more goods can be produced\u2014and sold to other countries\u2014in the future.\" In short, trade deficits can serve as a form of savings forfutureproduction. While economists generally view specific trade deficits as peripheral, communities previously dependent on manufacturing have experienced significant economic disruption as production shifted overseas, leading to very real social and economic hardships for affected workers and regions. However, most economists maintain that these concerns, while valid, are better addressed through targeted policies rather than broad tariffs aimed at eliminating trade deficits entirely. In today's global economy, trade deficits indicate that the U.S. has been an attractive destination for both consumer goods and investment capital. \"International trade is fundamentally no different than any voluntary trade, except that it takes place across politically or historically determined, and therefore, economically irrelevant, international borders,\" Lastrapes said. Thus, there is little correlation between a country's specific trade deficits and its overall economic performance.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6, 2025, that laid the groundwork for astrategic Bitcoin reserveand a broader U.S. digital asset stockpile, starting with Bitcoin already seized in criminal and civil forfeitures. Proponents arguethe reserve will financially benefit taxpayers and signal U.S. leadership in digital finance.Critics warn that it makes little sense for the U.S. government to hold a volatile asset that has no intrinsic value or strategic economic purpose, and caution that both political donations and the Trump family's financial interests in crypto pose potential conflicts of interest. The strategic crypto reserve grew out of Trump's promises during the 2024 election campaign, when he vowed to roll back regulations imposed under the Biden administration and make the U.S. the \u201cglobal hub for digital assets.\"He also pledged to appoint an AI\u00a0and\u00a0crypto \"czar\" to champion innovation in blockchain technologies. His pro-crypto platform reflected growing interest in digital\u00ad-asset diversification, and Bitcoin\u2019s capped supply and global use case as \u201cdigital gold\u201d underpin arguments for its inclusion alongside petroleum, dollars, gold, and foreign currencies. Holding Bitcoinmay confer some strategic advantages. It is an uncorrelated diversifier and a perceived store of value. Moreover, as corporations likeGameStopand MicroStrategy add bitcoin to their treasuries, government adoption could spur wider institutional acceptance. But not everyone sees the logic behind the order. Strategic reserves traditionally storecommodities like oilto cushion supply shocks. (The U.S. also has reserves of gold, critical minerals, and even cheese.) Critics argue that cryptocurrencies hold no intrinsic value (like gold or cheese) or key strategic commercial application (like oil). In addition, they say, holding large quantities of a highly volatile asset risks financial losses for taxpayers. Under the executive order, all bitcoin forfeited to the U.S. Treasury through criminal or civil proceedings are to be transferred into custodial accounts collectively named the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.Each federal agency will also review and report on any additional bitcoin it holds and transfer it to Treasury if eligible. The U.S. government's Bitcoin holdings are estimated to be worth at least $17 billion While initial capitalization relies solely on forfeited assets, Trump's order explicitly authorizes the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce to develop\"budget neutral\" strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin\u2014including open\u2011market purchases. The Treasury will establish a dedicated office to administer the reserves, with authority to deploy various strategies\u2014such asdollar\u2010cost averagingand hedging\u2014to manage holdings. The amount held will be publicly attested and visible on theblockchainas proof-of-reserve. Importantly, the governing framework prohibits any sale of held bitcoin; all holdings must be maintained as a strategic store of value. Despite Trump's order, digital assets remain subject to a complex patchwork of regulation across multiple layers of government\u2014state and federal. They range from stringent licensing regimes to proactive encouragement of blockchain businesses. In parallel to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Trump's Executive Order also calls for aU.S. Digital Asset Stockpileto manage non\u2010bitcoin digital assets seized by Treasury.This broader stockpile could include tokens likeether,ripple,solana, andcardano, as outlined in Trump\u2019s Truth\u00a0Social posts, enabling strategic disposition or sale over time. Critics say the inclusion of these other coins makes little sense, amounts to picking winners, and risks distorting the market. Unlike Bitcoin, which is not a product of any company or person, the coins in the broader stockpile are all commercial assets. Some note that their selection will benefit crypto billionaires who contributed to Trump's campaign. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks an unprecedented step toward integrating digital currencies into the national financial architecture. While this initiative could help solidify the U.S. crypto industry as a global leader, concerns remain about the reserve's strategic value and potential conflicts of interest involving Donald Trump and his family.",

        "content": "Warren Buffett, arguably the greatest stock picker of all time, has a surprising piece of advice for everyday investors: don't do it. \"A very low-cost index is going to beat a majority of the amateur-managed money or professionally managed money,\" Buffett has said. Despite building his $166 billion fortune through careful analysis and selecting undervalued companies as the longtime chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A), Buffett says his approach requires expertise, time, and emotional discipline that most investors lack.This seeming contradiction between Buffett's personal investment strategy and his advice to the public reveals essential truths about investing that can help anyone build wealth more effectively. Index fundshold every stock in a specific index, such as the S&P 500 index, which includes major companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (META). Unlike actively managed funds, where managers attempt to select winning stocks, index funds simply mirror the entire market or a specific segment of it, which is why holding these funds is called \"passive investing.\" Buffett recommends them for several reasons. First, fund managers trade far less frequently (the indexes don't change often), which means fees and taxes tend to be lower than those of actively managed alternatives. \"Costs really matter in investments. If returns are going to be 7% or 8% and you're paying 1% for fees, that makes an enormous difference to how much money you're going to have in retirement,\" Buffett says. The data support this view. According to S&P Global Inc. (SPGI), 64% of actively managed funds failed to match the S&P 500's returns in 2024. In addition, Buffett argues that it's extremely difficult for individual investors to consistently identifyundervalued stocks. The challenge is magnified by the fact that investment success often hinges on just a few outstanding performers. An Arizona State University study found that fewer than 100 stocks accounted for half of the stock market's total wealth creation over a 90-year period up to 2024, with similar results for most historical periods. The lesson is clear: if you don't own the few outperforming stocks, you have virtually no chance of beating the index. Even Buffett, with his extraordinary track record, admits the challenge. In his 2022 shareholder letter, he summarized nearly six decades of managing money: \"At this point, a report card from me is appropriate: In 58 years of Berkshire management, most of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so.\" In early 2025, amid market turmoil, Warren Buffett's net worth had grown by more than $24 billion as of the end of April, outpacing everyone else in the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Buffett argues that, for most investors, simplicity, discipline, and lower costs are more likely to build wealth than attempting to outsmart the market. \"The goal of the nonprofessional should not be to pick winners,\" he wrote in 2013. \"Instead, they should own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-cost S&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.\"",

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC) and shares of several other semiconductor companies moved higher following the report.  The repeal, which has not yet been finalized, would end the so-called AI Diffusion rule, the news outlet added, citing people familiar with the matter.  Nvidia, AMD, Intel and Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.  The AI Diffusion rule, enacted during the last days of the Biden administration, was designed to limit the spread of advanced AI technology outside the U.S., with the purpose to prevent foreign threats from accessing it. It puts countries into three tiers based on their relationship with the U.S. and limits the number of chips that can go to these countries.  The first tier includes 17 countries and Taiwan, with the group allowed to receive unlimited chips. Roughly 120 countries are in the second group, and they are capped on how many AI chips they can obtain. The third group, which includes China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, are blocked from obtaining the chips.  A number of companies and organizations have spoken out against the AI Diffusion Rule, including Nvidia, which called it \u201cunprecedented and misguided\u201d on the grounds that it could \u201cderail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\u201d The AI Diffusion Rule, which some analysts have said could be negatives for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, was set to go into effect on May 15.",

AMD\u2019s anticipated revenue hit is \"bigger than we expected and over a shorter period of time than we would have thought,\u201d UBS analysts said Wednesday.If AMD takes a $1.5 billion hit, Nvidia could face an impact of $5 billion to $7 billion per quarter, the bank said. That \u201cwould take away almost all of the \u2018fat\u2019 that we believe NVDA had,\u201d for its fiscal second quarter, which runs through July, UBS said. Last month, Nvidia said it expects to take a$5.5 billion chargein its fiscal first quarter after the U.S. implemented a licensing requirement for Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China. At the time, Morningstar analysts said, \"China has shrunk to about 10% of Nvidia's revenue from 20%, and we now expect it to go to close to zero.\" Nvidia is scheduled to post its first-quarter results on May 28. Bloombergreported late Wednesday that the Trump administration plans to repeal AI diffusion rules set to take effect on May 15 that would further limit sales of American AI hardware to a broader set of countries. However, the Commerce Department is expected to continue enforcing existing restrictions while it develops a new rule,the report said. Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Tuesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a case against the restrictions on selling to the Chinese market. Nvidia being barred from selling in China won\u2019t stop the country from developing its own chips, Hunag said. \u201cNo government, especially the government of our adversaries, are limited by the available capacity of computing for their military reasons,\u201d he said, adding that China-based Huawei is a \"formidable\" company. Huang said he expects the market for AI chips in China will reach $50 billion within a few years. \u201cFifty billion dollars is like Boeing. Not a plane\u2014the entire company,\u201d Huang said.

        "content": "U.S. stocks finisheda turbulent sessionhigher on Wednesday after Trump administration officials said they would meet with Chinese counterparts this weekend, boosting hopes for an imminent de-escalation of tensions between the world's two largest economies. Nearly three-quarters of the stocks in the S&P 500 rose on Wednesday, extending a weekslong ascent spurred by optimism about incoming trade deals. The Treasury Department and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative each announced late Tuesday that their respective leaders,Scott Bessentand Jamieson Greer, wouldmeet with Chinese officialsduring a trip to Switzerland starting Thursday. Treasury Secretary Bessent says the meetings will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The plans add to trade optimism that has propelled stock gains in recent weeks. The S&P 500 notched itslongest winning streak since 2004last week whenstrong earnings reportsandhintsat coming U.S.-China talks revived Wall Street\u2019s risk appetite. The rally erased all the S&P 500\u2019s post-\u201cLiberation Day\u201d losses. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s plenty of suspicion at how quickly various assets have rebounded\u201d from April'ssell-off, conceded Deutsche Bank analysts in a note on Tuesday. \u201cBut there are several examples from recent history where unloved rallies carried on for some time,\u201d including the months after 2020\u2019s COVID sell-off and the 2023-24 bull market, during whichrecession fearsloomed over markets. They note optimism about de-escalation with China is just one of several factors driving stocks\u2019 recent gains.Resilient economic datahas boosted confidence that tariffs won\u2019t cause a recession, andfalling oil priceshave eased inflation and given the Federal Reserve more latitude to cut interest rates. (The Fed, which concluded its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday,left interest rates unchangedand is seen continuing to do that at least until July, according to data from CME Group.) Morgan Stanley analysts in a note on Monday argued the U.S. and China willneed to reach a trade deal\u201cin the next couple of weeks\u201d for stocks to maintain their momentum and retake their all-time highs. Bessent, though, says the coming negotiations are unlikely to result in a comprehensive deal. \u201cMy sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal,\u201d Bessent toldFox Newson Tuesday. Nonetheless, given the stakes, any de-escalation could be enough to fuel further stock gains. The S&P 500's companies get an estimated 7% of their annual revenue, or $1.2 trillion, from China, according to an analysis by Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. A U.S.-China \u201cdecoupling\u201d would decimate that revenue and lead to \u201ca significant decline in earnings,\u201d Slok says. Bessent on Tuesday said the White House isn\u2019t interested in haltingtrade with China. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to decouple,\" he said. \"What we want is fair trade.\u201d This story has been updated to reflect the market close.",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has given the stock market a big boost in the past couple of years. Companies and governments around the globe have been rapidly adopting this technology thanks to its disruptive nature, especially considering the significant productivity gains that it is projected to deliver in the long run. Market research firm IDC predicts that each dollar spent on AI could generate $4.60 worth of value for the global economy in 2030. As a result, it won't be surprising to see the strong demand for AI hardware and software continue over the next five years.Nvidiahas been one of the pioneers in the field of AI, as the company's powerful chips have allowed customers to train and deploylarge language models (LLMs)and applications. Image source: Getty Images. The chipmaker is the biggest AI chip company out there, witnessing a whopping 114% increase in revenue in fiscal 2025 to $130.5 billion. Importantly, Nvidia has the ability to sustain its impressive growth momentum for a long time to come, thanks toa massive addressable market. However, the stock has been under pressure this year, thanks to restrictions on exports of its chips to China, the rising competition in the AI chip market, a potential drop in AI infrastructure spending, and the fallout of the tariff-fueled trade war. The good part is that investors can buy this potential long-term winner at an attractive valuation right now, especially considering thatit could regain its mojo in Mayfollowing the release of its upcoming results. However, there is another AI chip company that looks like a better buy than Nvidia. Let's take a closer look at that name. Marvell Technology(MRVL-8.08%)designs application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and networking chips that are used in data centers, enterprise networking, telecom networks, and automotive, industrial, and consumer applications. The company's data center business is now its biggest source of revenue. Marvell got 75% of its top line from sales of data center chips in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Feb. 1). The segment's revenue shot up a remarkable 78% year over year on the back of strong AI-fueled demand. Marvell points out that its AI revenue during the fiscal year was well above its original target of $1.5 billion, and it expects to \"significantly exceed\" its $2.5 billion revenue target for fiscal 2026. This massive spurt in Marvell's AI revenue is set to drive outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings. Consensus estimates are projecting a 42% spike in the company's revenue in the current fiscal year, to $8.2 billion. That would be a major improvement over the 5% revenue growth it clocked in the previous fiscal year. Even better, analysts are expecting Marvell's healthy revenue growth to continue over the next couple of fiscal years as well.  MRVL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts. This is set to translate into terrific bottom-line growth as well. Marvell's earnings are forecasted to jump by 78% in the current fiscal year to $2.80 per share, followed by healthy growth over the next couple of years.  MRVL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts. It's easy to see why analysts are expecting such impressive growth from this company. After all, the demand for custom AI processors and chips has been increasing, as they're more efficient in carrying out the specific tasks they're designed for when compared to general-purpose computing chips such asgraphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, custom AI processors can help lower operating costs, which is why the likes ofAmazonand others have been developing these chips with Marvell's help. Marvell points out that it currently has two high-volume customers for its custom AI chips. It expects to gain more business from these customers in the future, as they are likely to adopt the next generation of Marvell's custom AI processors. Marvell has brought onboard a third customer as well, to whom it will start shipping its AI chips next year. Looking ahead, there's a good chance that Marvell could attract even more customers for custom AI chips. That's because the company is pushing the envelope on the product development front and has developed a 2-nanometer (nm) node for manufacturing custom AI chips and networking components. Marvell currently offers chips based on a 3nm platform, and the move to the smaller 2nm process should ideally result in 15% performance gains and 30% lower power consumption. This new process node should put Marvell in a solid position to make the most of the fast-growing custom AI chip market, which it projects is on track to grow at a 45% annual rate through 2028 to $43 billion. Moreover, the company expects to corner a bigger share of this fast-growing niche with the help of its next-generation chips. Specifically, Marvell management believes that the company's share of the data center chip market could double to 20% in 2028 from 10% in 2023. So, don't be surprised to see Marvell maintaining a healthy pace of growth beyond the next couple of fiscal years. It's trading at less than 23 timesforward earnings, compared to Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 26. So investors can buy Marvell at very attractive levels right now, considering the big earnings jump it's expected to deliver. They may not want to pass up such an opportunity this month, as Marvell's long-term outlook indicates that it could deliver solid stock price upside for a long time to come.",

The \"AI diffusion rule,\" published in January and set to go into effect on May 15, would further tighten restrictions on sales of American AI hardware to other countries, but Trump plans to rescind the rule. The news was first reported byBloomberglate Wednesday. \u201cThe Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation. We will be replacing it with a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance,\u201d a spokesperson for the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said in a statement toInvestopedia. The Commerce Department is expected to continue enforcing export limits currently in effect while it develops a new set of restrictions to replace the diffusion rule, according toBloomberg'sreport.
