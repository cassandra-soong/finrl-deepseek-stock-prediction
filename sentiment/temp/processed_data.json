        "content": "Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) stock sank on Wednesday after comments from an Apple (AAPL) executive stoked concerns that artificial intelligence is chipping away at Google\u2019s bread-and-butter online search business. Apple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue reportedly said search volume in Apple\u2019s Safari browser, in which Google is the default search engine, declined for the first time ever in April, which he attributed to the increasing popularity of AI alternatives. According to Cue, Apple is considering adding AI-enabled search services like those from OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to its devices at some point in the future. Shares of Alphabet tumbled more than 7% on Wednesday to lead S&P 500 decliners. Questions about Google\u2019s search dominance have been buzzing about Wall Street ever since 2022 when OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT exploded onto the scene. Analysts immediately began speculating that AI chatbots would supplant search engines as internet users\u2019 preferred source of information and analysis. For some market watchers, Cue\u2019s comments were further proof of this trend. \u201cSearch is shifting away from the traditional blue-link results page that we've loved for the past 25 years, to a simplified AI-powered result,\u201d wrote Gene Munster, Managing Partner at Deepwater Asset Management, in a post to X. He says the change poses two problems for Google: \u201cFirst, the monetization model of sponsored ads needs to be overhauled. Second, Google Search has new competitors, including OpenAI, Grok, Perplexity, etc.\u201d Wall Street analysts, though, were generally encouraged by what they saw in Alphabet'sfirst-quarter earningslast month. \u201cWe continue to believe Google has data and distribution advantages and has closed the (large language model) performance gap,\u201d Bank of America analysts wrote of the company's efforts to fend off AI-first competition. \"While still early days, we are excited about AI Mode which brings Gemini directly into search and adds advanced reasoning multi-modal capabilities,\" said JPMorgan analysts, referring to an experimental search feature that, according to executives, could double the time users spend on Google. Alphabet has a big head start on its AI-first competitors. Google\u2019s share of global search traffic is estimated to be about 90%. The next-largest search engine, Bing, is estimated to receive just 4% of all search queries. The threat of AI companies encroaching on its search traffic is acute for Alphabet. Ads displayed on Google\u2019s search engine and related properties like Gmail, Google Maps and Google Play, accounted for 56% of Alphabet\u2019s total revenue in the first quarter. Google has made it a priority to keep its advantage by integrating AI into its search engine. The company has rolled out AI Overviews, which respond to queries from more than 1.5 billion users in 140 countries a month, said executives on Alphabet\u2019s earnings call last month. Executives say AI summaries are monetized at approximately the same rate as traditional search. One very serious risk to Google's search dominance: antitrust enforcement. Last August, a federal judge agreed with Justice Department prosecutors that Googleoperated an illegal monopolyin the online search market. Cue's comments on Wednesday came as part of testimony in proceedings meant to find a remedy to that monopoly.",

        "content": "Alphabet(GOOGL) shares tumbled Wednesday after an Apple (AAPL) executive reportedly said theiPhone maker is looking to add AI-powered search options to its Safari browser, adding they could eventually replace standard search engines like Google's. The two tech giants have a longstanding partnership that sees Alphabet\u2019sGooglepay Apple an estimated $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default option on Safari in exchange for the iPhone maker receiving a cut of Google\u2019s ad revenue through the browser. The news heightened concerns thatAI is chipping awayat Google\u2019s bread-and-butter online search business. Alphabet shares have slumped 20% since the start of the year through Wednesday\u2019s close, in part over concerns that an economic slowdown could hit revenue as ad spending is reined in. The stock fell more than 7% to close near $151 on Wednesday. Below, we take a closer look at Alphabet\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify major price levels worth watching out for. Following an ominousdeath crosssurfacing on the chart last month, Alphabet shares staged a countertrend rally to form arising wedge, a bearish pattern that indicates acontinuationof the stock\u2019s move lower. Indeed, that move looks to have started in Wednesday\u2019s trading session, with the price breaking down below the pattern\u2019s lower trendline on above-average dailyvolume. Moreover, the drop coincided with therelative strength index (RSI)plunging below the 50 threshold, signaling accelerating selling momentum. Let\u2019s identify two major support levels on Alphabet\u2019s chart where the shares may attractsupportand also locate key overhead areas worth watching during future recovery efforts. The first support level to watch sits around $141. This area could attract buying interest near ahorizontal linethat connects last month\u2019s prominent low with severalpeaksthat developed on the chart in the fourth quarter of 2023. Selling below this major technical level could see the shares retreat to lower support at $131.

        "header": "Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Palantir Technologies in a Bubble? We Just Got Our Answer...",
        "content": "Putting aside the exceptional volatility we've witnessed on Wall Street since the beginning of April, the can't-miss trend over the last two and a half years has unquestionably been the evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI). In its simplest form, AI empowers software and systems with the ability to reason and act on their own. This capacity to make split-second decisions without human oversight, as well as evolve to (potentially) learn new skills or jobs, gives this technology a truly jaw-dropping addressable market. InSizing the Prize, PwC pegged this market potential at $15.7 trillion, globally, by the turn of the decade. When most investors think of the AI revolution,Nvidia(NVDA2.95%)is probably the first company that comes to mind. In less than two years, Nvidia went from being a fringe leader in the tech industry, with a $360 billion market cap,to the greatest thing since sliced bread, with a valuation that easily topped $3 trillion. Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell GPU architecture rapidly became the preferred hardware in Al-accelerated data centers. Image source: Getty Images. But Nvidia has been usurped as Wall Street's AI darling by data-mining specialistPalantir Technologies(PLTR1.44%). Heading into this week, Palantir was worth $293 billion, and its shares had risen by roughly 1,840% since the start of 2023. It went from being one of many high-growth tech stocks to a foundational piece of the AI revolution. Yet following the release of Palantir's much-anticipated first-quarter operating results, there's a new label that can be added:Wall Street's biggest bubble stock. Though I'll explain how it's a bubble stock in detail in a moment, let's take a closer look at how Palantir has dazzled Wall Street and added $278 billion in market value in 29 months. The biggest catalyst for Palantir is that its AI-driven software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutionscan't be duplicated at scale. While the company's Gotham and Foundry platforms may contend with small-scale competition, there simply isn't a one-for-one replacement for the services they provide. Nothing on Wall Street is more valued by investors than a sustainable moat -- and Palantir certainly offers one. Gotham continues to be the crown jewel. This is the segment thatlands multiyear contracts with the U.S. federal governmentand its allies. Gotham handles data collection and analysis, as well as plays a critical role in military mission planning and execution. America's robust defense spending has led to pretty consistent growth. In the March-ended quarter, U.S. government revenue soared by 45% from the prior-year period. Foundry hasn't been a slouch, either. This relatively newer platform leans on AI and machine learning to help businesses make sense of their data and streamline their operations. U.S. commercial revenue surged a whopping 71% during the first quarter, which is an indication that Palantir is just scratching the surface with this segment, as well as earning subscriptions from larger companies. Another reason Palantir has excelled is its push to recurring profitability, which occurred well before anyone on Wall Street had expected. Profits help to validate Palantir's dual-platform approach, and its sustained double-digit sales growth rate has clearly excited the investing community. Lastly, Palantir closed out March with $5.43 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which represents about a $200 million boost from where it ended 2024. Having a lot of cash and no debt means CEO Alex Karp and his team can aggressively reinvest in its AI-powered platforms, as well as undertake shareholder-friendly actions at times, such as share buybacks. Image source: Getty Images. Considering the uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff policy, as well as the possibility of the U.S. federal government reducing defense spending, investors were particularly interested in Palantir's forward-looking sales and adjustedfree cash flow (FCF)guidance for the recently completed quarter. In early February, Palantir guided for $3.741 billion to $3.757 billion in full-year sales, with $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in full-year adjusted FCF. On Monday, May 5, itupped its 2025 sales guide to $3.89 billion to $3.902 billion-- an increase of $147 million at the midpoint -- as well as lifted the high and low end of its adjusted FCF by $100 million to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. While Palantir increasing the midpoint of its sales guidance by 3.92% might sound impressive, it comes on the heels of its stock tipping the scales atnorth of 100 times trailing-12-month salesentering this week. Based on the midpoint of the company's now-dated 2025 sales guidance ($3.749 billion), Palantir would have been valued at aprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof roughly 78 come February 2026 (i.e., when it reports its fourth-quarter operating results). Updating for the new guidance, which calls for a midpoint of $3.896 billion in full-year revenue, lowers its projected year-end P/S ratio to (drum roll) 75.2! It hardly makes a dent. To put into context just how unbelievably expensive Palantir stock is relative to sales, take a closer look at how other market-leading businesses performed prior to bubble-bursting events.  MSFT PS Ratiodata byYCharts. Before the dot-com bubble burst,Microsoft,Amazon, andCisco Systemsall peaked at respective P/S ratios ranging from roughly 31 to 43. I added Nvidia to this chart, as well,which topped out at a P/S ratio of just over 42 last summer. Though there are other public companies with P/S ratios north of 100, what we don't see is market-leading megacap businesses valued at P/S ratios north of 40 for any extended period -- let alone a P/S ratio that's camped out at more than 100! To add fuel to the fire, every next-big-thing innovation for more than 30 yearshas navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion. Investors have persistently overestimated how quickly a new technology will be utilized and adopted, which eventually leads to outsized expectations not being met. While a company like Nvidia would almost immediately feel the pain associated with an AI bubble-bursting event, Palantir Technologies would be partially insulated by its multiyear government contracts and Foundry subscription revenue. But \"partially insulated\" doesn't mean immune. Palantir's unjustifiable valuation premium would almost certainly come under fire if the AI bubble bursts, which history suggests will eventually happen. Rarely are stock-specific bubbles this easy to recognize. Though I do believe Palantir is worthy of some level of premium due to its sustainable moat and recurring revenue, no market leader has been able to sustain a P/S ratio of 30, let alone 75 or 100. Palantir is, in my view, Wall Street's biggest bubble stock.",

        "content": "TheS&P 500(^GSPC0.43%)delivered a return of 25% (including dividends) last year, but had you invested in theVanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF(VOOG0.41%)instead, you would have earned a much higher return of 35.9%. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the performance of theS&P 500 Growthindex, which holds 211 of the best-performing growth stocks from the regular S&P 500. But last year's result wasn't a one-off because the Vanguard ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 every year, on average, since it was established in 2010. Here's why I think that trend will continue in 2025, despite the ETF starting the year on the back foot relative to the S&P. Image source: Getty Images. TheS&P 500has a very strict entry criteria. To qualify for inclusion, companies must have a market capitalization of at least $20.5 billion, and the sum of their earnings must be positive over the most recent four quarters. But even after ticking those boxes, a special committee meets once per quarter to decide which companies make the cut. The S&P 500 Growth index refines those criteria even further. It selects stocks from the regular S&P 500 based on factors like their momentum and the sales growth of the underlying companies. That's whyNvidiais the largest holding in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF -- the company grew its revenue by 114% during its last fiscal year, and its stock more than doubled in both 2023 and 2024, signaling clear momentum. In fact, compared to the S&P 500, the Vanguard ETF assigns much higher weightings to the sectors that host many of the largest and fastest-growing American companies. Sector Popular Stocks Vanguard ETF Weighting S&P 500 Weighting Information Technology Nvidia,Microsoft, andApple 37% 29.6% Communication Services Alphabet,Meta Platforms, andNetflix 14.4% 9.2% Consumer Discretionary Amazon,Tesla, andMcDonald's 12.4% 10.3% Data source: Vanguard. Sector weightings are accurate as of March 31, 2025, and are subject to change. Microsoft,Alphabet, and Amazon just reported their financial results for the first quarter of 2025 (ended March 31), and each company exceeded Wall Street's expectations at the top and bottom line. Their cloud computing segments continued to deliver rapid growth, led by soaring demand for artificial intelligence (AI) services.Meta Platforms' financial results also received a boost from AIduring the first quarter, as the technology helped drive higher engagement on Facebook and Instagram. According to PwC,AIcould add an eye-popping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, so it could power the next long-term growth phase for companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Tesla, andNvidia. But despite being heavily weighted toward tech and tech-adjacent companies, the Vanguard ETF is actually quite diversified. Among its top 20 holdings, investors will also find payment giantsVisaandMastercard,Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway, investment bankJPMorgan Chase, and retail powerhousesCostco WholesaleandWalmart. The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF is down 4.3% so far in 2025, so it's doing slightly worse than the S&P 500, which is down by just 3.7%. The high-growth segments of the stock market were trading at elevated valuations heading into President Trump's \"Liberation Day\"tariffannouncements in early April, so they suffered much steeper declines than the broader market when investors flocked to the safety of cash. However, the ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 15.4% since it was established in 2010, outpacing the average annual gain of 12.8% in the S&P 500 over the same period.  VOOGdata byYCharts I think that trend will continue in 2025 for a couple of reasons. First, President Trump has already paused the more aggressive \"reciprocal tariffs\" he imposed on America's trading partners (except those on China), as dozens of countries have come to the table to negotiate new deals. Second, many of the products sold by the top holdings in the Vanguard ETF aren't affected by tariffs. Semiconductors are exempt, for example, much to the benefit of companies likeNvidiaandBroadcom. Moreover, digital subscription products, digital advertising, and cloud services were never subjected to Trump's tariffs at all, which is great news for Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and even Amazon to a lesser extent (its e-commerce business is grappling with tariffs). Third, the strong earnings results from the companies I mentioned earlier should help the Vanguard ETF recover its current deficit to the S&P 500. Stocks like Microsoft and Meta both erased their year-to-date losses following their reports for the recent quarter and are trading in the green as of this writing. Even in the event of an economic slowdown or arecession, those tech giants are likely to hold up better than the rest of the market because of the composition of their product portfolios, their enormous scale, and their strong balance sheets. As a result, I think there is a very high chance the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF recovers to beat the S&P 500 yet again in 2025.",

        "header": "Nvidia Investors Just Got Great News From Meta Platforms",
        "content": "Good news has been in short supply forNvidia(NVDA2.95%)investors this year. Shares of the technology giant are down 15% in 2025 as of this writing, despite solid earnings results released in February that not only beat the market's expectations but also pointed toward a bright future. Nvidia's pullback is a result of factors outside of the company's control. The potential fallout of President Trump's new tariffs along with the export controls on sales of the company's chips have dented investor confidence in the stock. Additionally, Wall Street is concerned about a potential drop in the pace of spending onartificial intelligence (AI)hardware. However, a closer look at the recent developments in the AI space suggests that the drop in Nvidia stock this year doesn't seem justified.Meta Platforms(META1.68%), which is among Nvidia's major customers, recently released its quarterly results, which hint at better times for the chipmaker. Image source: Getty Images. Meta Platforms released its first-quarter results on April 30. The social media giant blew past consensus estimates as its AI-focused spending helped it win a bigger share of advertisers' wallets and led to an increase in user engagement across its family of applications. Meta management points out that the adoption of its AI-enabled ad tools is increasing thanks to improved audience targeting and higher conversion rates. Even better, Meta says AI has the potential to increase productivity within the advertising industry. As a result, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that \"the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today.\" What's more, management sees a significant jump ingenerative AIrevenue over the next decade. As reported by TechCrunch, Meta estimates its generative AI revenue could land between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion in 2035. That would mark a massive jump over the $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue the company is expecting from this technology in 2025. Considering that Meta has generated $170 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, the potential opportunity outlined above suggests it could witness a remarkable increase of its top line over the next 10 years. All this explains why Meta has decided to further increase its capital spending this year. Management now expects the company's 2025 capital expenditures (capex) to land between $64 billion and $72 billion. It was earlier projecting $60 billion to $65 billion in capital spending for 2025. Meta's updated capex guidance points toward a 73% increase in spending compared to 2024. Zuckerberg made it clear why the company is going to increase its capex on the latest earnings call, saying, \"This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.\" This statement is significant for two reasons. First, Meta is going to keep investing in AI hardware thanks to the gains that this technology is bringing to advertisers, which is why they're willing to spend more money across its family of apps. For instance, Meta's average price per ad increased 10% year over year, outpacing the 6% growth it recorded in the year-ago period. Second, Meta plans to keep buying AI hardware despite a potential increase in infrastructure costs, which can be attributed to the uncertainty created by the tariff war. This is an indication that any potential increase in the costs of buying AI hardware should be offset by the gains that this technology is expected to deliver. Meta seems willing to spend more money to buy Nvidia chips even if they become more expensive due to new tariffs. Meta isn't the only one that's going to spend big bucks on AI infrastructure.Alphabetalso reiterated its $75 billion capex forecast for the current year, whileMicrosoftis going to increase its outlay in fiscal 2026. Meanwhile, huge AI infrastructure projects such as Stargate, which could see investments worth a whopping $500 billion over the next four years, are also underway. The deployment of Nvidia's chips as part of the Stargate project has already begun. The company couldwin big from the massive amount of moneythat's going to be spent under this program. Moreover, Nvidia's foundry partnerTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturinghas also indicated that the demand for AI chips is set to remain solid in 2025, withrevenue from this category expected to double. Nvidia appears to have all of the ingredients it needs to deliver another solid quarter of results on May 28, which should help investors regain their confidence in thisAI stock. With that in mind, savvy investors can start picking up shares before the upcoming earnings report as the stock trades at an attractive 26 times forward earnings estimates.",

        "content": "You might think that stocks in the artificial intelligence (AI) market are on a roll right now. As of May 6, shares of AI hardware leaderNvidia(NVDA2.95%)had gained 20.3% in 30 days. Tech-heavy portfolios like theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC0.27%)market index and theArk Innovation ETF(ARKK1.59%)are up by 15.9% and 13.8%, respectively. These are massive single-month leaps, worthy of admiration in a normal economy. But of course, I'm writing this overview one month after the Trump administration's \"Liberation Day\" tariff torrent on April 2. Those massive gains disappear almost completely if I stretch the chart just a couple of days further back:  NVDAdata byYCharts And the volatile jitters started a bit earlier. Nvidia and the ARK Innovation fund are down by roughly 15% since the end of 2024, while the Nasdaq Composite index lost 8% over the same period. All three are showing double-digit drops from their 52-week highs. From that perspective, it's easy to find bargain-priced AI stocks right now. Two of the best ideas on my desk today are memory chip makerMicron Technology(MU2.82%)and digital advertising expertThe Trade Desk(TTD1.51%). Let me show you why this dynamic duo of AI stocks seems poised for great long-term returns at this juncture. Let's start with Micron. There are only three memory chip makers worth mentioning on the global market, with a combined market share of 95%. Micron is one of them, supplying about one-quarter of all the high-speed SDRAM chips to a memory-hungry world. It is also a leading provider of long-term storage NAND chips, though that segment is a bit more crowded with five large-scale manufacturers. Memory chips have always been an important piece of the technology puzzle. You can't run a smartphone, a classic PC, or even an old Pac-Man game without SDRAM chips. The lightning-fast read and write speeds of NAND memory, also known as Flash memory, have made them ubiquitous in modern computers. And the amount of memory in each device keeps increasing, driven by larger programs and more advanced technologies. Of course, the AI boom added more fuel to these fires. Ultra-fast high bandwidth memory (HBM) is particularly useful in the torrential data shuffling that goes into training large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or Gemini. Image source: Getty Images. For example, Micron's HBM sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the recently reported second quarter of fiscal year 2025. That's 50% above thefirstquarter's HBM revenues. \"Our HBM shipments were ahead of our plans, demonstrating strong execution of our ongoing ramp,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said onthe earnings call. \"We are focused on growing HBM capacity in our existing manufacturing facilities to meet requirements through 2026.\" And don't forget that Nvidia hand-picked Micron as the preferred memory supplier for its GB200 and GB300 AI systems. These are fully integrated \"AI factories for enterprises\" featuring several dozen of Nvidia's top-of-the-line Blackwell Ultra AI accelerators. So when Nvidia wins GB300 (or Blackwell) customers, Micron benefits from the related memory orders. Yet, Micron's leading role in the AI revolution seems easy to forget. The stock is down 49% from last summer's all-time highs, trading at just 7.3 times forward earnings estimates or 2.9 times trailing sales. These are valuations more often seen in struggling retailers or financially strapped companies on the edge of bankruptcy. Micron is a thriving AI stock with high-octane sales growth and robust profits. I don't know about you, butMicron's stock looks like a no-brainer buyto me. If Micron is a nuts-and-bolts play on the AI market's infrastructure, The Trade Desk is a great example of advanced technology companies putting AI tools to customer-friendly use. The company launched anAI-based ad-buying systemlong before it was cool. The Koa AI platform has been around since June 2018, helping advertisers find the best channels and ad spots to publish their marketing campaigns. The more recent Kokai system goes a few steps further, bidding for ad spots and optimizing digital marketing budgets on the fly. The Trade Desk is a fast-growing cash machine. The company has done well in times of tight ad-buying budgets, as its services can help ad buyers make the most of their limited assets. The lessons learned and relationships made in those tight spots tend to carry over when times are good again. Why not continue optimizing your marketing results when it's easier to find a few budget dollars? The stock is down 61% from last December's record prices. In all fairness, The Trade Desk's shares probably deserved a correction at that lofty point. Even now, it trades at the generous valuation of 26 times forward earnings and 11.3 times sales. This isn't the stock for you if you can't stomach rich valuations for proven high-growth winners. The rest of us can focus on The Trade Desk's all-weather business performance. This company knows how to make money even in an inflation-powered recession. I don't see why the nextmacroeconomic downturnshould be different. The Trade Desk is a winning AI stock with plenty of growing left to do.",

Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing sharply higher as investors react to a U.K. trade deal and the loosening of AI chip export restrictions.Nasdaq,S&P 500, andDow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are up 1.2%, 0.9%, and 0.7%, respectively, after the indexesclosed higher in the prior sessionafter theFederal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady.\u00a0Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is surging to trade at around $99,500. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are rising slightly. Oil futures are gaining while gold futures are declining. President Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that the U.S. hadreached a \"full and comprehensive\" trade dealwith the United Kingdom.This represents the first trade agreement the U.S. has reached with a trading partner sinceTrump imposed a series of tariffsthatroiled marketsand raised consumer anxiety. The agreement comes as U.S. officials are set tomeet with their Chinese counterpartsover the weekend amid escalating trade barriers between the countries. Trump said he will discuss the UK agreement at a 10 a.m. ET Oval Office press conference. Shares of Google parent Alphabet(GOOGL) are rebounding by 2% in premarket trading after tumbling yesterday as an Apple (AAPL) executive reportedly said theiPhone maker is looking to add AI-powered search options to its Safari browserand could eventually move away from standard search engines.The news heightened concerns thatAI is chipping awayat Google's bread-and-butter online search business.\u00a0Alphabet's stockfell more than 7% yesterdayand has declined 20% this year. Chipmaker stocks are moving higher in premarket trading on indications the Trump administration plans torepeal Biden-era chip curbsthat were set to take effect later this month. The \"AI diffusion rule,\" set to go into effect on May 15, would further tighten restrictions on sales of American AI hardware to other countries.

        "content": "It's been a really interesting year in the stock market so far in 2025. At one point, theS&P 500had dropped as low as 15% while theNasdaq Compositecratered by 21%. While news of Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek and mixed economic indicators have made some impacts on the capital markets this year, I think the biggest contributors to the volatility (by far!) are the newtariffpolicies from the Trump administration. Although the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have recovered from their low points, both indexes still feature negative returns on the year -- with some of the biggest laggards being megacap technology stocks. As I write this,Nvidia(NVDA2.95%)haslost nearly $1 trillion in market valueso far in 2025. Indeed, such a sell-off would suggest that investors have soured on the formerly red-hot semiconductor darling. With its fiscal first-quarter earnings report scheduled for May 28, is now a good time to buy the dip in Nvidia stock? Read on to find out what history says should happen after the company publishes its first-quarter report later this month. The chart below illustrates Nvidia's share price movement over the last three years. The purple circles with the letter \"E\" in the center indicate earnings reports. For the majority of the last few years, Nvidia stock has climbed immediately following an earnings report. At a high level, this would suggest that Nvidia stock could bepositioned to continue its winning streak.  NVDAdata byYCharts Unfortunately, there's one major nuance to call out before assuming Nvidia stock will rise once again. The most notable exception to Nvidia's post-earnings jolts occurred back in February when the company reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full 2024 year. Since the company reported earnings on Feb. 26, shares have dropped by 13% as of this writing. Although the precipitous drop-off in Nvidia stock since the company last reported earnings might be a little jarring, there are some important details to discuss. The earnings report itself was anything but a problem. The main event back in February was Nvidia's new Blackwell GPU architecture. During the fourth quarter, Blackwell outperformed management's internal estimates by bringing in $11 billion in revenue. What's even better is that Nvidia's management said it believes the company's gross margin will improve throughout the year as the Blackwell ramp-up continues to scale. Moreover, management touted a line of successor GPU architectures includingBlackwell Ultraand Rubin, which I'm confident should help Nvidia maintain robust growth prospects over the next several years. With so much good news surrounding Nvidia's actual business, why has the stock been selling off for months now? As I alluded to above, uncertainty around tariffs combined with newexport controls around the Chinese market(an important source of revenue for Nvidia) have investors worried about the company's growth. While I understand these concerns, I think they are overblown. Image source: Getty Images. As an investor, I will be listening closely to how the secular trends fueling AI infrastructure are impacting the company's long-run prospects relative to near-term headwinds in China and the tariff environment. Over the last couple of weeks, investors have gotten a glimpse of other leading AI businesses and how they are navigating the ongoing tariff-driven turbulence.Meta Platforms,Alphabet,Amazon, andMicrosofthave all reported earnings for the first calendar quarter of 2025. One thing stitching these companies together is their collective focus on AI infrastructure. On a combined basis, these companies are planning on spending hundreds of billions of dollars this year ondata center buildouts. To me, if tariffs were a longer-term concern or mission-critical issue for business then big tech companies would not be doubling down on their AI roadmaps right now. Given that all of these companies are Nvidia customers, I think the chipmaker remains in a position of strength and will extinguish any investor fears about long-term growth. As a result, I think Nvidia stock could beat expectations andbegin to attract growth investors once again. I see Nvidia as a good buying opportunity right now for growth investors who intend to hold the stock for the long term.",

Shares of Krispy Kreme (DNUT) were recently down roughly 20%, extending their year-to-date decline to the neighborhood of 65% and exploring hot, fresh lows since their 2021 IPO. A raft of downbeat news weighed heavily on the shares, which this morning were changing hands around $3.50 apiece. The company turned in a year-over-year decline in sales and a widening net loss in its latest quarter, along with a second-quarter revenue forecast that, at the midpoint of its range, was below the current Visible Alpha average. Other news from the company further exacerbated matters: Krispy Kreme said it would suspend its dividend, citing a desire for \"greater financial flexibility,\" and said it planned to stop bringing its products to more McDonald's (MCD) restaurants \"while it works to achieve a profitable business model for all parties.\" The announcementof that partnershiplifted the shares when it arrived a bit more than a year ago. \"Our ability to become a bigger Krispy Kreme requires that we become better, and we are taking swift and decisive action to pay down debt, de-leverage the balance sheet and drive sustainable, profitable growth,\" CEO Josh Charlesworth said in a statement.

        "content": "Growth stocks have been rallying in recent weeks, and that's usually great news for Cathie Wood. The founder, CEO, and stock-picking ace of the Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has momentum on her side. Her largest fund has soared nearly 30% since bottoming out last month, but starting lines matter. That same fund would have to more than triple to get back to its all-time highs set four years ago. Wood did a fair amount of buying as the market moved higher on Wednesday. She added to existing stakes inNvidia(NVDA0.28%),Advanced Micro Devices(AMD1.31%), andCRISPR Therapuetics(CRSP5.77%). Let's take a closer look at Wood's latest purchases. The country's third most valuable company by market cap is a study in contrasts. It's a wealth-altering 13-bagger over the past five years, but it has also surrendered 13% of its value in 2025. The developer of graphics processing units andartificial intelligence(AI) chips has fallen 24% since hitting all-time highs earlier this year. Wood seems to sense that there's an opportunity here to pick up more shares for almost a quarter less than what they were fetching at their peak four months ago. She added to her Nvidia stake in more than half of Ark's growth funds on Wednesday. It doesn't mean that she's right. Image source: Getty Images. Despite the company commanding the pole position in the surging demand for AI chips to propel language learning models to new heights, headwinds have emerged in recent months. The first hit came earlier this year when China's DeepSeek announced that it could crank out decent generative AI results without springing for the latest Nvidia hardware. The bigger hit these days comes from the global tariffs rollout by the U.S., particularly the standoff with China that has resulted in chipmakers warning of big one-time hits. Nvidia revealed last month that it would have totake a charge for as much as $5.5 billionrelated to items that are now restricted from sale in China. Nvidia doesn't report its quarterly results foranother three weeks. Investors are still holding out for strong growth. Analysts see Nvidia topping $43 billion in revenue, a healthy 65% jump. Earnings should rise 46% to hit $0.81 a share. Despite all of the noise, Wall Street pros have only made marginal downward revisions to their growth forecasts from now through the end of fiscal 2027. Nvidia's recent pullback against its backdrop of growth makes the shares a potential bargain here. Investors can buy the stock for a little more than 20 times next year's projected earnings. It's obviously still growing a lot faster than that. There is a cyclical nature to semiconductor stocks, but the AI revolution is still in the early stages. Wood is a buyer here for Ark. It doesn't mean that she's wrong. Another company seeing a resurgence in growth on the spike in demand for AI chips is AMD. It reportedrobust resultsearlier this week. Revenue rose 36%, marking its fourth straight quarter of accelerating top-line growth. Margins widened, culminating in a 55% jump in earnings per share. A beat on both ends of its income statement initially sent the shares nicely higher in Wednesday's trading, but it had given back all of those upticks later in the day before recovering to a modest 2% increase by the close. AMD isn't getting the same kind of long-term respect as Nvidia. It's not just that AMD is now warning of just a $1.5 billion charge this year as a result of export restrictions into China. AMD stock has been a laggard relative to the AI leader. In the same five-year span that has transformed Nvidia into a 13-bagger, AMD hasn't even fully doubled. It's trading at a lower multiple of 17 times next year's projected earnings, but it's not the kind of discount to Nvidia one would expect after years of divergent stock charts. This doesn't mean that both stocks can't beat the market from here. There won't be a sole victor in the AI story. Nvidia and AMD notwithstanding, most of the purchases that Wood made on Wednesday came from her passion for medical tech and gene editing. CRISPR has become one of the 10 largest holdings across all of Ark's ETFs. CRISPR is a leader in gene editing, tackling oncology, autoimmune, diabetes, and cardiovascular solutions. Revenue is currently meager, and analysts don't see a profit here for several years.There is upside if Wood is right. The stock is trading nearly 85% below the all-time high it hit back in early 2021.",

        "content": "Crypto stocks got a jolt Thursday as the price ofbitcoinclimbed above $100,000 for the first time since early February. Bitcoin was at $101,000 recently, up from an overnight low around $96,000, as investors welcomed news of a trade agreement between the U.S. and U.K. and the prospect of more deals. President Donald Trump said Thursday that \"many other deals\" are in \"serious stages of negotiations,\" and expressed optimism that progress would be made in talks between U.S. and Chinese officials over the weekend. The latest developments on trade provided a boost to risk assets broadly, asU.S. stocks also surged. Investors have been looking for concrete signs of progress on trade talks amid concerns that the tariffs the Trump administration has proposed will cause economic growth to stall. Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) were up 6% in early-afternoon trading, while Strategy (MSTR), the Bitcoin buyer formerly known as MicroStrategy, added 7%. Bitcoin miners Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Mara Holdings (MARA) climbed 7% and 8%, respectively. Bitcoinhit a record highof around $109,000 ahead of Trump's inauguration in January amid optimism that the new administration would adopt policies to benefit the crypto industry. Trump has made efforts to be seen as a pro-crypto president, including signing an executive order in March that laid the groundwork for astrategic bitcoin reserveand a broader U.S. digital asset stockpile. However, bitcoin stumbled in recent months, along with the U.S. stock market, as concerns about the potential impact of Trump's trade policy weighed on risk appetite. With today's rally, bitcoin has risen about 33% from its early-April low of $76,000.",

        "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s reported plans torepeal Biden-era chip-export curbsthat were set to take effect later this month would be a win for Nvidia (NVDA) and other chipmakers. But their relief could prove temporary, analysts warned. A spokesperson for the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security toldInvestopediaWednesday that the administration intends to replace the rule with other restrictions\u2014which Citi and Deutsche Bank analysts warned could be stricter than Biden's. \"While this news is a welcome relief to AI related semi names in the near-term, as the complexity of the AI Diffusion rule is removed, we still believe the U.S. government's overriding goal to restrict access to AI semis remains unchanged,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote Wednesday. In a note to clients Thursday, Jefferies analysts said they expect the Trump administration to take a government-to-government approach to new rules, as ithas said it will do with tariffs, and use AI chip-export limits as leverage in ongoing tariff negotiations, potentially extending the time needed to roll out new rules. \"We won't know the details for some time,\" Jefferies said, leaving Nvidia and other chipmakers a longer window to sell products that haven't been restricted yet, but also with a great deal of uncertainty.\u00a0Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news comes just weeks after Nvidia said it expects to take a$5.5 billion hitto its fiscal first-quarter results, due for release May 28, after the U.S. implemented a licensing requirement for Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China. TheBiden AI diffusion rule, if allowed to take effect and enforced, would potentially lower Nvidia's earnings by another 11% to 14% in a worst-case scenario, according to Bank of America Securities estimates. Shares of Nvidia were up nearly 1% in recent trading Thursday but have lost close to 12% of their value since the start of the year as worries about the trajectory of AI spending and export restrictions weighed on the stock. \"In the interim expect volatility to reign supreme,\" Deutsche Bank said.",

D-Wave reported first-quarter revenue of $15 million, a 509% increase from a year ago. The surge in revenue was driven by the sale of an Advantage quantum computing system to Germany\u2019s J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre. D-Wave\u2019s net loss narrowed to $5.4 million, or 2 cents a share, from $17.3 million, or 11 cents per share, last year. D-Wave finished the quarter with a record consolidated cash balance of $304.3 million, an amount that management expects will be sufficient to fund the company until it\u2019s profitable. \u201cThe first quarter of 2025 was arguably the most significant in D-Wave\u2019s history,\u201d said CEO Alan Baratz. The company, he said, \u201cbecame the first to demonstratequantum supremacyover classical computing on a useful real-world problem\u201d with a peer-reviewed paper published in the scientific journalSciencein March.

        "content": "There\u2019s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.  Data analytics software vendor\u00a0Palantir\u00a0jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of\u00a0Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants\u00a0Cisco\u00a0and\u00a0IBM\u00a0earlier this year.  Microsoft\u00a0tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by\u00a0Apple\u00a0and\u00a0Nvidia.  Palantir\u2019s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.  The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.  Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company\u2019s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has\u00a0benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build\u00a0artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.  In an aminated\u00a0shareholder letter\u00a0attached to the company\u2019s earnings report, Karp applauded his company\u2019s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have \u201cturned a corner and begun following our lead.\u201d  \u201cWe note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm\u2019s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,\u201d Karp wrote.  But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it\u2019s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit.\u00a0Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.  That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.  \u201cFundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,\u201d wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.  Among the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it\u2019s only that high because\u00a0Broadcom\u00a0and\u00a0Tesla\u00a0are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla\u2019s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.  Palantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following\u00a0first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a\u00a0deceleration in international commercial sales\u00a0that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy our shares,\u201d Karp told CNBC\u2019s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re happy. We\u2019re going to partner with the world\u2019s best people and we\u2019re going to dominate.

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher after President Trump unveiled anew trade agreement with the U.K. It is the first deal announced since last month's suspension of \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The agreement will keep the 10% broad tariff in place, but will give the U.K. concessions on automobile and steel industry tariffs in exchange for \"increased market access\" for U.S. agricultural, industrial, and chemical products in Britain. The S&P 500 gained 0.6% on Thursday. The Dow industrials also closed 0.6% higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.1%. Shares of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) surged 14.1%, gaining themost of any stock in the S&P 500on Thursday. The company, which also provides body cameras and other products for military and law enforcement, posted better-than-expected sales and profits for the first quarter and boosted its full-year guidance. Axon touted strong growth for its software and services segment, highlighting robust demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) policing systems. Epam Systems (EPAM) also surpassed consensus estimates with its quarterly results, and shares of the digital engineering and cloud-based software provider jumped 12.9%. Growth in IT services revenue, AI-related demand, and strategic partnerships helped underpin the strong performance. EPAM also increased its full-year sales outlook and announced that its current chief revenue officer would take the reins as CEO later this year. Enphase Energy (ENPH) shares advanced 12.2% after the energy technology firm launched a plug-and-play solar energy system in Germany. The new product is designed for users who live in apartments or have limited roof space. It can also be used in off-grid locations such as cabins, campsites, and mobile homes. With Thursday's gains, Enphase stock staged a partial recovery from losses posted late last month after its quarterly resultsfell short of expectations. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder and other online dating services, sank 9.6%, posting the S&P 500's weakest daily performance. The company reported a year-over-year decline in paying users across its platforms, including the dating sites Hinge and OkCupid. Furthermore, Match said it would cut its workforce by 13% in an effort to cut costs as it navigates challenges related to user engagement. Fortinet (FTNT) shares fell 8.4% in the wake of the cybersecurity firm's quarterly earnings release. Although its first-quarter adjusted profits came in ahead of consensus forecasts, revenue for the period missed the mark, and Fortinet issued underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and the full year. Despite the relatively cautious outlook, Fortinet maintains a strong leadership position in the global firewall market. Shares of drug wholesaler and pharmaceutical solutions provider Cencora (COR) lost 6.8% on Thursday, reversing the strong gains posted by the stock in the prior session following a strong earnings report. Notwithstanding the strong quarterly performance, Cencora noted that it faces challenging growth comparisons for GLP-1 weight-loss products along with softness in clinical trial activity and its specialty logistics business.",

        "content": "AppLovin (APP) shares surged Thursday after themobile app marketing provider announcedthe sale of its mobile game business and quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations. The company, which offers AI-powered software products to assist developers target ads andmonetizeapps, said late Wednesday it sold its mobile game unit to London-based Tripledot Studios for $400 million and will hold a 20% stake in the private firm following the transaction. In addition to topping analysts\u2019 first quarter earnings forecasts, the company issued current quarter advertisingrevenueguidance above expectations, while also pointing out that it focuses on mid-market web advertisers that have less exposure tariffs. AppLovin shares tumbled as much as 62% between mid-February and early April aftershort sellers published reportsaccusing the adtech company of deceptive practices. The stock gained 12% to close Thursday at $339.51, and is up about 70% from last month's low point. Below, we break down thetechnicalson AppLovin\u2019s chart and identify price levels that investors are likely watching. After setting arecord highin mid February, AppLovin shares staged a sharp reversal back to the200-day moving average, where they traded mostly sideways since that time. However, the stock recently broke out above a falling wedge pattern and reclaimed the50-day moving averagein a move that coincided with therelative strength indexcrossing back above the 50 threshold to signal improving price momentum. Let\u2019s take a closer look at three crucial overhead areas on AppLovin\u2019s chart worth watching, while also identifying an importantsupport levelto monitor during potentialpullbacks. The first overhead area to watch sits around $352. The shares could encounter selling pressure at this level near atrendlinethat connects the March peak and the upper range of aconsolidationperiod that formed on the chart throughout most of December and January. A decisivebreakoutabove this area could see the shares climb to $525. Investors who have averaged in at lower prices may decide to lock in profitsin this region near the stock\u2019s record high. To project an overhead area to watch if the stock moves intoprice discoverymode, investors can use the bars pattern tool. When applying this technique to AppLovin\u2019s chart, we extract the stock\u2019suptrendfrom August to December last year that commenced from the 200-day MA and reposition it from last month\u2019s touch of the 200-day MA. This analysis projects a potential longer-term bullish move up to around $940 if price action rhymes. During pullbacks in the stock, it's worth keeping track of the $235 level. Retracements to this importanttechnicalarea would likely attract strong buying interest near last month\u2019s initial breakout point from the falling wedge pattern, which also closely aligns with the March trough.

        "content": "With the second quarter of 2025 now over a month old, many investment funds will soon begin disclosing what stocks they held at the end of the first quarter, essentially providing investors a glimpse of what they bought and sold. It's a particularly interesting time to see how large institutional funds invested early in the year, given all of the volatility. First-quarter filings won't show what the market did in April, following President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement on April 2. But they offer an important glimpse of how investors were approaching tariffs, as well as high valuations in the broader market, particularly for the artificial intelligence (AI) giants. Another thing happened in the first quarter with a major institutional shareholder. The Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) -- the sixth-largest pension fund for teachers in the U.S. --\u00a0cut its stake inNvidia(NVDA0.28%),Tesla(TSLA3.31%), andApple(AAPL0.63%). But it piled into a popular pharmaceutical stock that's up 419% over the last five years. While we don't know when the TRS fund sold during the quarter, we do know that the fund cut its stake in several of its largest holdings, some of the most popular stocks in the market: It's not clear whether the portfolio managers were cutting the fund's tech exposure across the board, or specifically targeting these names. But they seemed to have made a timely call, given what happened to these three stocks in the first quarter of the year: TSLAdata byYCharts. Nvidia and many other AI stocks ran into trouble earlier this year when the Chinese tech company DeepSeek managed to build a chatbot rivaling OpenAI's ChatGPT, reportedly using less advanced chips and spending much less than OpenAI. There's still much debate over the level of resources that went into DeepSeek's model, but investors nevertheless began to question overallAI demandas well as massive capital expenditure plans by the hyperscalers driving AI. Tesla faltered as CEO Elon Musk got more involved in politics, specifically with his work on the initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Reports of falling demand for Tesla vehicles globally made analysts question whether Musk's outspokenness had hurt the brand. Furthermore, given Tesla's high valuation, the company needs to execute on future initiatives, including autonomous driving and robotics. Apple shares fell the least among these three in the first quarter, but perhaps investors should have been more concerned, given how much manufacturing the consumer tech giant does in China and Vietnam. Shares fell hard after April 2 but rebounded following Trump's 90-day pause on higher tariff rates. The Trump administration has temporarily exempted consumer electronics made in China from tariffs,  although any renewal of those would not work in Apple's favor. Image source: Getty Images. While TRS cut a number of its top positions, it also increased its stake in the pharmaceutical giantEli Lilly(LLY-3.19%)by 11% in the quarter. Lilly, which first went public in 1951, has risen 395% (as of May 6) over the last five years, rivaling the strong performances of many tech and AI stocks. Well-known as the first company to commercialize insulin, Eli Lilly has performed well in recent years. This is largely due to the performance of its GLP-1 drugs, which help people looking to manage diabetes type 2 and to lose weight. One of Eli Lilly's premier drugs, Mounjaro, which helps people with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar, had its revenue rocket 113% higher year over year in the first quarter of 2025. Zepbound, a drug that helps people manage their appetites and ultimately eat less, increased its sales 347% year over year. The company also continues to make progress in new drug development. CEO David Ricks noted in an earnings statement that Lilly received regulatory approval for several oncology and immunology drugs, and continues to see success in later-stage studies for its drugs related to diabetes and obesity. It's investing further in development and planning to construct four new manufacturing facilities. Management also reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion of revenue, and expects a performance margin in the range of 40.5% to 42.5%. While tech has dominated the investing landscape for several years, it's always a good idea for investors to buy stocks in a variety of sectors to add diversity to their portfolios. Eli Lilly is a rare large-cap andstable pharmaceutical stock, whose returns have rivaled those of even some of the most headline-grabbing AI innovators.",
