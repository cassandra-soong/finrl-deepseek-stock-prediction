        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s profit soared 124% after valuations of tech startups like ByteDance Ltd. rose, in a boost for the Japanese company\u2019s aggressive data center investment plans. Most Read from Bloomberg As Coastline Erodes, One California City Considers \u2018Retreat Now\u2019 A New Central Park Amenity, Tailored to Its East Harlem Neighbors What\u2019s Behind the Rise in Serious Injuries on New York City\u2019s Streets? How Finland Is Harvesting Waste Heat From Data Centers Lawsuit Challenges Trump Administration Policy on Migrant Children SoftBank, which on Tuesday reaffirmed plans to invest up to $30 billion in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI, reported net income of \u00a5517.18 billion ($3.5 billion) in its fiscal fourth quarter. That was helped by the Vision Fund, which swung to a profit of \u00a526.1 billion thanks to gains in investees such as ByteDance and China\u2019s Didi Global Inc. Shares of SoftBank jumped as much as 5.8% early Wednesday morning in Tokyo, their biggest intraday gain in more than a month. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman unveiled the US-based Stargate project in January with promises to deploy $100 billion into data centers and other infrastructure. That could rise to more than $500 billion over time. Maintaining a healthy cash flow and balance sheet is key to securing the billions of dollars needed at minimum cost. Son and Altman\u2019s undertaking however coincides with mounting macroeconomic turbulence. Their bid has been stymied as debt investors and bankers reassess the value of data centers, Bloomberg News reported. SoftBank has yet to begin detailed discussions on how the large-scale data center rollout will be financed. \u201cUncertainty is growing and it\u2019s becoming harder to see the landscape ahead,\u201d SoftBank Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said during an earnings conference. \u201cBut SoftBank has not changed course for 44 years. We are not changing now.\u201d He said it wasn\u2019t true that the Stargate endeavor has slowed. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the plan has become stuck due to tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we bring about each project, one by one.\u201d More broadly, SoftBank\u2019s earnings jump reflects its exposure to the startup market after years of Vision Fund investments into hundreds of tech companies. In the March quarter, investors re-rated Chinese firms such as ByteDance that are managing to sustain growth despite economic slowdown back home. Online video darling TikTok has kept up a strong pace of international growth, while SoftBank was also helped by share price increases at Didi and Auto1 Group SE. That outweighed declines at baby-products retailer BrainBees Solutions Ltd. and stock price falls at other publicly listed Indian portfolio companies such as food-delivery app Swiggy Ltd. and e-scooter maker Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. Vision Fund 2, which is backed by SoftBank, logged a $708 million loss, it said. Global investment in AI computing is helping to lift sales at SoftBank\u2019s chip unit Arm Holdings Plc and SoftBank is further strengthening its hold on chip technologies Son believes crucial for AI. It\u2019s announced a $6.5 billion acquisition for chip designer Ampere Computing LLC, that it expects to close in the second half of the year. For the year ended March, SoftBank earned a \u00a51.15 trillion net income, its first profit in four years after springing back from a loss of about \u00a5228 billion in the previous year. Credit watchers are wary about how SoftBank plans to finance its big global ambitions, however. Goto stressed the tech investor\u2019s commitment to keeping its loan-to-value ratio below 25%, saying that the company has the financial strength to weather any volatility ahead. The company is likely to resort to more bonds, loans and asset-backed finance, especially if there is a selloff in equities in the months ahead, according CreditSights analyst Mary Pollock. \u201cGiven the increased macroeconomic uncertainty (including the implications for rates, FX, equity valuations) and the uncertainty around the pace of AI demand, costs, and the appropriate valuations, we are even more concerned for SBG creditors,\u201d she wrote in a note to investors. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says SoftBank Group\u2019s reported loan-to-value might breach its 25% limit after including the $6.5 billion acquisition cost of Ampere Computing, an investment of up to $30 billion in OpenAI and an additional sum in Stargate, assuming asset values stay unchanged vs. March. LTV had already reached 18% in March from 8% a year ago. It might need to raise more from asset-backed financing or sell assets to manage its balance sheet. \u2014 Sharon Chen, BI Credit Analyst --With assistance from Edwin Chan and Umesh Desai.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. The market closed last week mostly lower, however, the S&P 500 has been up more than 7% since April 11, indicating a returning positive sentiment. On May 10, David Lefkowitz, Equity Strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, joined CNBC to discuss his bull case for the US equities. Lefkowitz acknowledged the volatility that has been around since the tariff announcement; however, he believes that backdrop remains fairly constructive. He elaborated that the market has had some significant buy signals since early April, characterised by the volatility index giving one of the highest readings, investor sentiment being cautious, and investor positioning has been depressed. Historically speaking, whenever these things have happened in the past, the US equities have performed exceptionally well in the preceding 6 to 12 months. Lefkowitz noted that he is not too concerned with the day-to-day news and volatility, as the market will get choppy on trade negotiation deals. Rather, he is more focused on the bigger picture, which indicates that stocks will ultimately end up higher over the next 12 months. While answering a question regarding the recent rebound in the market, Lefkowitz highlighted that when the volatility index comes down, as it has over the past few weeks, history tells us that the market does not make new lows. Although the market will still be chopping a little. However, it is anticipated to stay within the historic average of 5%. Moreover, the equity strategist is also not concerned about the valuations and believes that as soon as the companies start posting earnings growth, the backdrop will help the market reach its next high. While talking about his most convicted sectors, Lefkowitz noted that he likes secular growth stocks. He elaborated that growth as a sector was hit earlier this year due to doubts regarding AI trends and its ability to generate a return on investment. This has resulted in the sector being at the bottom of the market. However, Lefkowitz believes that the demand for AI products and the sophisticated infrastructure will keep growing for at least the next few years, thereby generating sustainable earnings growth. To compile the list of 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold for the long term, we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 hedge fund database. Using the screener, we aggregated a list of growth stocks that have grown their sales by at least 30% over the past 5 years. Next, we cross-checked the 5-year sales growth for each stock from Seeking Alpha and ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

The company\u2019s GPUs and software applications are powering the AI revolution around the world. On May 8, DBS analyst Fang Boon Foo maintained a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst highlighted the dominant market position of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), particularly noting its high-end GPUs. Foo noted that the company differentiates on the back of its innovative approach to annually upgrading its AI accelerators, with the upcoming Blackwell chips set to replace the current Hopper generation. Moreover, its fundamentals remain strong, demonstrated by record year-over-year growth and a robust demand for its products. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported a quarterly revenue of $39.3 billion, up 12% from Q3 and up 78% from a year ago. The Data Center segment again posted a record quarterly revenue of $35.6 billion, reflecting a 93% increase year-over-year. The company ranks as the best growth stock to buy and hold for the long term. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: \u201cNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the undisputed leader in accelerated computing, with dominant market share in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) powering AI workloads across data centers, edge devices, and emerging platforms. Its end-to-end ecosystem\u2014from silicon to software (CUDA, networking, and AI frameworks)\u2014creates high switching costs and a widening competitive moat. With secular demand for AI infrastructure still in its early innings, Nvidia stands to benefit from sustained topline growth and strong operating leverage. In early January, a little known Chinese AI company, DeepSeek, released its large language model (LLM), DeepSeek-R1, to an unexpecting world. This model was purportedly trained on very few high-end Nvidia chips and was highly efficient when compared to other leading models. This release set off a chain reaction where investors have had to grapple with the idea that the world may not need as many GPUs as previously thought, which hampered the Nvidia buy case and sent the P/E multiple down to its cheapest level in the past 5 years.\u201d Overall NVDAranks 1ston our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold for the long term. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares will remain on watchlists after the AI favoritereturned to the $3 trillion market cap clubon Tuesday following the announcement of a major partnership with a state-backed Saudi Arabian AI company. The deal, which coincided with the beginning ofPresident Trump\u2019s four-day tour through the Middle East, will see the chipmaker sell several hundred thousand advanced GPUs to an AI subsidiary of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund over the next five years, starting with anAI supercomputerpowered by 18,000 GB300 chips. Nvidia shares lost more than 40% of their value between February and April amid concerns thatmoderating AI spendingand the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies could weigh on the company's sales. However, the stock has rallied 50% from last month's low amid optimism over new trade deals. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify crucial price levels worth watching out for. Nvidia shares have trended sharply higher after breaking out from a falling wedge pattern last month, with the price staging a decisive close above the200-day moving average (MA)in Tuesday\u2019s trading session. It\u2019s also worth pointing out today\u2019s move occurred on the highestvolumein several weeks, signaling increased interest in the chipmaker\u2019s stock While therelative strength index (RSI)confirms bullish momentum with a reading just below the 70 threshold, the indicator also cautions nearingoverboughtconditions, which could lead to short-term profit-taking. Let\u2019s focus on two crucial overhead areas on Nvidia\u2019s chart that investors may be watching and also identify importantsupport levelsworth monitoring during futurepullbacks. The first area to watch sits around $130, This area, just above Tuesday\u2019s closing price, may provide overhead resistance near ahorizontal linethat links a series ofpeaks and troughson the chart stretching back to last August. The bulls\u2019 ability to reclaim this level could see the shares climb to the crucial $150 area. Investors who have averaged into the stock may decide tolock in profitsin this region near several peaks that formed on the chart slightly below the stock\u2019srecord high, set in early January. Upon pullbacks in the stock, it\u2019s worth monitoring the important $115 level. The shares find aconfluenceof support in this area near the initialbreakoutpoint from the falling wedge pattern, the 50-day MA, and a trendline that connects a range of trading activity on the chart extending back to last September. Finally, a steeper drop could see Nvidia shares revisit lower support around $96. Investors would likely see this as a high-probability location toaccumulate sharesnear the late-April trough, which also closely aligns with two prominent peaks that formed on the chart in March last year.

        "header": "ARM Shares Initially Tumbled on Outlook Before Rallying. Is It Time to Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "Share prices ofArm Holdings(ARM1.59%)initially sank following the cautious outlook it issued with its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, May 7, but the stock has rallied back this week following the news over the weekend that the U.S.-China trade war was cooling down. The stock is now trading up more than 17% over the past year, but down 31% from its summer 2024 all-time highs, as of this writing. Given the recent volatility the stock has seen, let's take a closer look at thesemiconductorcompany's most recent earnings results and guidance to see what investors should do with their shares. Image source: Getty Images. While its stock price initially tumbled, Arm's fiscal Q4 results were actually quite strong. Its revenue soared 34% year over year to $1.24 billion, with both royalty revenue and license revenue hitting records. That edged past the $1.23 billion analyst revenue consensus. License revenue led the way, soaring 53% year over year to $634 million. The company said the growth was driven by significant demand for its Armv9 technology, although it noted that license revenue can fluctuate due to the timing and size of multiple high-value license agreements. The company also signed a multi-yearartificial intelligence (AI)partnership with the Malaysian government to accelerate the development of an Arm-based AI ecosystem in the country. The deal will give the country access to Arm technology at the CSS (Compute Subsystem) level to rapidly design chips. This means the country is getting deeper access to Arm's chip design framework. It increased its number of Arm Total Access licenses in the quarter by 4 to 44. More than half of its top 30 customers use this license. Its Arm Flexible Access customer count reached 314. Royalty revenue, meanwhile, climbed 18% year over year to $607 million. The growth was driven by the continued adoption of its newer Armv9 architecture, which carries a much higher royalty rate than its v8 technology. It said that its royalty growth was broad-based, with strength in the data center, automotive, smartphones, and Internet of Things verticals. In the data center market, it said it expects half of new server chips and hyperscalers (companies with massive data centers) to be Arm-based this year. Part of this is due to the acceleration ofNvidia's(NVDA5.71%)Blackwell chip. While Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)are not based on ARM architecture, Nvidia's Grace Blackwell superchip combines its GPUs with Arm-basedcentral processing units (CPUs). Arm also said it is seeing more customers turn to it for custom silicon, both with CPU, GPU, and NPU (neural processing unit) solutions. Meanwhile, despite only a 2% increase in smartphone shipments in the quarter, Arm saw its smartphone royalty revenue increase 30%. The company's technology is in nearly every advanced smartphone, so this is a huge market for it. The company credited the launch of its Armv9-based platform focused on Edge AI, which processes AI workloads on devices instead of the cloud. It said several smartphone chipmakers have begun using the platform. Annualized contract value (ACV), which smooths out license revenue, climbed 15% to $1.37 billion. Looking ahead, Arm management did not offer full-year guidance due to limited visibility. It said that about 10% to 20% of its revenue typically comes from shipments into the U.S. For the first quarter, it is looking for revenue to range between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 12%. Royalty growth is projected to be between 25% and 30%. However, it faces a tough comparison for licensing revenue. It projected adjusted EPS to be between $0.30 and 0.38. Analysts were looking for adjusted EPS of $0.42 on revenue of $1.1 billion. Arm is seeing nice momentum both in the data center, which should continue with the ramp-up of Nvidia's Grace Blackwell superchip. At the same time, it's also seeing strong momentum with smartphones, despite only modest shipment growth. In the past, the company has said its Armv9 technology royalty rates can be up to double for CSS, which is being used both in data centers and edge devices, like smartphones, to handle AI workloads. As such, the company is proving to be an AI winner. The cooling of the U.S.-China trade war, meanwhile, should help ease much of the pressure from tariffs. While the company is growing much faster than the smartphone market, shipment volumes are still important. This should allay investor fears about a potential smartphone market slowdown. From a valuation perspective, the stock trades at aforward price-to-earnings (P/E)ratio of over 67 based on fiscal 2026 analyst estimates. That's high, but toward the low end of the range where the stock has traded in the past since its IPO in September 2023.  Data byYCharts. Overall, I think ARM should be solid over the long run, and I think it has one of the best models in the semiconductor space. However, given its valuation, I would keep position sizes on the smaller side.",

The board approved maximum payouts for CEO Jensen Huang and his team as a result. Huang also got a raise, his first in a decade, and some senior executives saw pay packages rise as much as 70%. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang got a 50% basepay raiselast year but that barely accounts for his nearly $50 millionpay package. Nvidia told investors on Tuesday that Huang\u2019s fiscal 2025 total compensation, including cash and stock, was valued at $49.9 million, versus $34.2 million the year prior. The boost came amidacross-the-boardpay hikes for the executive team\u2014including a $7 million hike to Huang\u2019stotal target compto bring him closer in line with the market.

        "content": "The cloud computing industry is dominated by giants likeAmazon,Microsoft, andAlphabet, but those providers typically focus on the largest and highest-spending enterprises. Tailoring their cloud services to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) wouldn't be an economical strategy, because those customers wouldn't contribute enough revenue to move the needle. DigitalOcean(DOCN-0.47%), on the other hand, focuses exclusively on providing cloud services to SMB customers. Plus, it has a growing portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) services that are helping even the smallest businesses adopt this revolutionary technology. DigitalOcean stock is down 76% from its record high, which was set during the tech frenzy in 2021. The stock was undeniably overvalued then, but it's starting to look very attractive, especially in light of the company's accelerating revenue growth and soaring profits. Here's why investors might regret not buying the dip. Image source: Getty Images. DigitalOcean provides a range of cloud services to more than 600,000 customers, from simple data storage and website hosting to complex software development tools. It differentiates itself from the largercloud platformsby offering cheap and transparent pricing, highly personalized support, and simple deployment processes. These attributes are suited to SMBs, especially those without in-house technical expertise. DigitalOcean is now helping SMBs access the power ofAI. It operates data center infrastructure fitted with graphics processing units (GPUs) from top suppliers likeNvidiaandAdvanced Micro Devices. In order to keep prices down, DigitalOcean doesn't use the latest GPU variants, but it does offer Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI300X, which can deliver more than enough computing power for moderate AI workloads. Plus, DigitalOcean offers fractional capacity, meaning SMBs can access between one and eight GPUs at a time. This is ideal for small businesses that might want to deploy anAI chatboton their website to handle customer service inquiries, for example. That kind of workload doesn't require thousands of Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs, which is what the bigger cloud platforms are focused on providing. In January this year, DigitalOcean also launched a new platform called GenAI which allows SMBs to create custom AI agents to serve customers, onboard new employees, and even generate business insights from internal data. These agents are built on the latestlarge language models(LLMs) from top developers likeOpenAI, Anthropic, andMeta Platforms, which are among the most complex in the world. The GenAI platform is still in beta mode, but DigitalOcean says 5,000 customers have already used it to deploy over 8,000 AI agents so far. DigitalOcean generated $210.7 million in totalrevenueduring the first quarter of 2025 (ended March 31), which was a 14% increase from the year-ago period. That growth rate accelerated for the second consecutive quarter, which is a sign that momentum is building, and AI is a key reason why. Although DigitalOcean doesn't disclose exactly how much revenue its AI services generate, the company said it grew by an eye-popping 160% year over year during Q1. But it gets better -- management says demand for GPU capacity continues to outstrip supply, so investors should expect rapid growth from the AI business for the foreseeable future. DigitalOcean's Q1 results were even more impressive when you consider that it slashed its totaloperating expensesby 6% to improve its bottom line. In other words, the company could be growing its revenue even faster by investing more aggressively in costs like marketing, which would attract more customers. But the strategy worked like a charm. DigitalOcean'snet income(profit) soared by a whopping 171% to $38.2 million during the quarter, which translated to $0.39 inearnings per share(EPS). When DigitalOcean stock peaked in 2021, it was trading at a loftyprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof around 30, which was unsustainable. The 76% decline in the stock since then, combined with the company's consistent revenue growth, has pushed its P/S ratio down to just 3.7. That's actually a 34% discount to its three-year average of 5.6, which excludes the 2021 period.  DOCN PS Ratiodata byYCharts. Now that DigitalOcean is consistently profitable, we can also measure its valuation using theprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Based on the company's trailing 12-month EPS of $1.11, its stock trades at a P/E ratio of 27.6, which is near its cheapest level since it went public four years ago.  DOCN PE Ratiodata byYCharts. TheNasdaq-100index trades at a P/E ratio of 29.3, so DigitalOcean is cheaper than a basket of the world's biggest technology stocks (which includes many of the top providers of cloud and AI services). DigitalOcean values its addressable market at $400 billion this year, so it hasn't even scratched the surface of its opportunity. Considering the rapid growth of its AI revenue, its soaring earnings, and its valuation, investors might regret not buying the stock today when they look back on this moment in a few years' time.",

        "content": "The three major benchmarks soared on Monday as the U.S. announced an initial import tariff agreement with China. This was a game-changing moment for investors as concerns about President Donald Trump's tariff plan had weighed on sentiment for weeks. Investors were particularly worried about an escalating trade war with China that could wreak havoc on the economy. But that worst-case scenario seems to be drifting away. This week, the U.S. agreed to set tariffs at 30% on China, a level light-years away from the 145% announced last month. All of this was particularly good news for technology stocks and growth stocks, in general, because many tech stocks rely on China as a source of production and parts for their products. (The U.S. exempted electronics products from tariffs, but that move was said to be temporary.) Growth companies rely on a strong economic environment to progress. It's no surprise, therefore, that the growth and tech-heavyNasdaq Composite(^IXIC1.61%)rallied, gaining 4.4% in one trading session on this U.S.-China news. Which stocks may benefit from this newfound momentum? Here are my three favorites to buy now in the Nasdaq rally. Image source: Getty Images. As I mentioned, tech stocks haven't yet faced Trump's tariffs on their imported electronics products, due to the exemption. But the president has said this situation is temporary, which is exactly why it's important to see lower general tariff levels on a major trading partner like China. It suggests that if and when the U.S. sets a tariff for electronics, the level should be manageable. Apple(AAPL1.15%)is a company that's particularly concerned by this. The tech giant has made moves in recent years to expand the production of its products to countries including India and Vietnam. Earlier this month, the company said it would shift most of its iPhone production for the U.S. to those countries. This doesn't completely eliminate the tariff impact, though, as some imports from China will continue -- and other countries face import tariffs, too. Still, this week's trade agreement should lift some of the pressure on Apple stock and allow investors to focus on the quality of this smartphone leader. The company has delivered a long track record of earnings growth to investors and has shown it has a solid brand moat or competitive advantage -- iPhone or Mac users don't often abandon those products for rivals. This installed base is helping Apple's services revenue soar to records, a trend that could have much farther to go. Right now, Apple looks like a buy as it trades for 29xforward earnings estimates.  AAPL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. Alphabet(GOOG0.89%)(GOOGL0.73%)also is a leader in its field, and this leadership has helped it generate billion-dollar earnings year after year. The company owns Google Search, a search engine that consistently holds 90% share of the global market. As a result, businesses rush to Google with their advertising budgets in order to reach potential customers. Though Alphabet makes most of its revenue through this advertising, it's also earning significant revenue through its cloud business, Google Cloud. This business is among market leaders and is registering double-digit growth quarter after quarter. In the most recent period, Google Cloud revenue climbed 28% to more than $12 billion. On top of this, Alphabet is heavily investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and is already benefiting from this in both of these businesses. AI has helped improve search results and improve the advertising experience for clients. It's also driving growth in the cloud business as demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI tools offered by Google Cloud increase. For all of this, you don't have to pay top dollar. In fact, Alphabet stock trades for only 16x forward earnings estimates, making it the cheapest of the\"Magnificent Seven\"tech giants. This list wouldn't be complete withoutNvidia(NVDA5.71%), the world's leading AI company. Tariff news weighed heavily on Nvidia stock since the company produces many of its products outside of the U.S. Though this AI giant announced a major move to invest in production at home, any relief from potential near-term tariff pressure is good news. Why buy Nvidia now? Though the world's No. 1 AI chip designer already has announced spectacular revenue growth quarter after quarter, this growth story may be in its early days. The AI infrastructure buildout is ongoing, withNvidia customers pledgingto continue their heavy investments in AI. In addition, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit throughout the future stages of AI growth. This will occur as companies apply AI agents to solve real world problems at their businesses and as automaker customers use Nvidia technology to power self-driving capabilities. Nvidia also has a few catalysts ahead, including Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang'skeynote at Computexat the start of next week and the company's earnings report on May 28. Any positive updates could push the shares higher -- especially since today, at 27x forward earnings estimates, they remain in bargain territory. Right now is a great time to get in on this famous AI player and hold on as the long-term growth story continues.",

The jump in shares came after Monday's gains on the back of news that theUS and China had agreed to cut tariffson each other's imports by 115% for 90 days, marking a de-escalation in trade tensions. Shares in server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) soared 16% on Tuesday and were up nearly 8% in pre-market trading on Wednesday, thanks to a strong analyst rating. Raymond James (RJF) analysts initiated coverage of the stock, giving it an outperform rating and setting a price target of $41 (\u00a330.72).

Super Micro said it expected full-year revenue for 2025 to fall to between $21.8bn and $22.6bn, down from its prior guidance of $23.5bn and $25bn. Another tech name on the rise on Tuesday was Palantir (PLTR), which closed the session 8% in the green, with shares hitting a fresh high. Archer Aviation (ACHR), which develops electrical vertical take-off and landing vehicles, announced a partnership with Palantir in its quarterly results on Tuesday. The company said that their plans included the \"development of next-gen software utilising AI to improve a range of aviation systems.\" Read more:Stocks that are trending today Palantir's shares fell last week amid continuedconcerns about the company's lofty valuation, with its first quarter results showing a drop in international sales. The company said first quarter revenue in its international commercial segment, which sells software to businesses abroad, fell 5% compared to the previous year due to \"headwinds\" in Europe. Revenue for this area of thebusiness came in at $142m, which was below the $160m expected by analysts. However, Palantir's revenue for the quarter, of $884m, was ahead of estimates of $863m and earnings per share of $0.13 were in line with forecasts, according to Bloomberg data. In Europe, shares in Tui (TUI1.DE) slid 10.5%, after the German travel operator flagged a slight slowdown in summer bookings. Tui said that while summer 2025 bookings were \"robust\", they were \"slightly down at -1%, based on flat risk capacity in a competitive environment with our focus on growing dynamically, protecting margin and reducing cost.\" Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio The company posted a 1.5% increase in revenue for the second quarter to \u20ac3.7bn (\u00a33.11bn). Underlying operating losses increased by \u20ac18m to \u20ac207m, though Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Aarin Chiekrie pointed out that this was better than an expected loss of \u20ac224m. Chiekrie, who holds shares in Tui, said: \"Operating in a sector that is at the mercy of consumer sentiment and spending power can be difficult.

        "content": "When it comes to investing, a common misconception is that you need to be an expert stock picker in order to build wealth. While investing in individual stocks is one way to build your portfolio, it's far from the only method that works. In fact, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has often touted thatinvesting in theS&P 500is a suitable strategy for investors who do not have time to do their own research or are not interested in analyzing specific companies. If you have $500 in investable income, that's all it takes to get started for an investment in theVanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO0.75%). Let's dig into why this index fund makes the perfect vehicle for beginner investors and explore what strategies you can use to build a seven-figure portfolio just by investing in the S&P 500 index. As its name implies, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is an index fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500. Buying shares in the fund provides you with exposure to the stocks that comprise the S&P 500, without actually needing to own shares in the specific companies themselves. This means that a position in the Vanguard S&P 500 comes with exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocksApple,Microsoft,Nvidia,Meta Platforms,Alphabet,Amazon, andTesla, as well as leaders in other industries such asBerkshire HathawayandEli Lilly. One thing that makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF different from other S&P 500-themed funds is that it is market-cap weighted. This means that the companies withthe largest market capitalizationshave more of an influence on the fund's returns. Another benefit of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is that it is cheap to own. The fund'sexpense ratiois just 0.03% -- meaning that if you invest $500 per month ($6,000 annually), you will pay just $1.80 in management fees to Vanguard. Image source: Getty Images. While thereturns in the S&P 500can differ significantly from year to year, long-run trends clearly show that the index has climbed higher over time. The graph below illustrates the total return of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF since inception. Not only has the index returned almost 600% over the last 15 years, but it has even soared to new highs following the latest recession (annotated by the grey column in 2020).  VOO Total Return Leveldata byYCharts These dynamics underscore Buffett's philosophies that building a diversified portfolio and holding on to your winners for long periods of time can result in multi-bagger gains. In the table below, I've summarized the gains you can expect by investing $500 per month into the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF over 30 years and expecting a 10% annual return on average. Calculations by author. The table above hits on some really important investment themes. First, building wealth takes time (i.e., patience). In addition, in order to reap the full benefits ofcompound growth, contributing to your portfolio on a consistent basis is key. As the trends above illustrate, investing the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF can make you a millionaire -- it simply boils down to how much capital you can contribute, how often you make these investments, and how long you plan to hold your position.",

Welcome to Trader Talk where we dish out the latest Wall Street buzz to keep your portfolio sizzling. Look, I'm Kenny Pulcurry coming to you live from the iconic New York Stock Exchange, a place that had been my home for decades and it still fuels the puzzle, capitalism, entrepreneurship, and freedom. Now, let's jump into my big take for the week.Let's cut through the noise. You can't manage risk if you don't know what you're holding. Too many investors buy stocks, ETFs, crypto, you name it, based on the headlines on hype or someone else's conviction. But if you can't explain why you own it and what drives its value, you're not investing. You're just renting volatility. It's easy to fall in love with a ticker symbol, a flashy name, a hot chart, a glowing upgrade from an analyst, but here's the thing, markets don't reward blind conviction.They reward understanding. Do you know how your company makes money where its growth comes from, what risk it faces? If, if they raise rates, how does it impact the balance sheet? If margins compressed, is their pricing power to push back? These are all questions real investors ask before they hit the buy button and it's not just about individual stocks. ETFs, mutual funds, even broad market indexes. You need to know what's under the hood.If your diversified ETF is 30% in the same five tech names, you're not really that diversified. You're concentrated and you don't know it yet. The biggest portfolio blow ups don't come from bad picks they come from good picks that you didn't understand. They come from being overexposed, over leveraged, or simply.Unaware of what the hell is in your portfolio. The bottom line, if you can't explain it in two sentences why you own something, you probably shouldn't own it. Know your holdings, know your thesis, and when the market tests you, and it will, you have the conviction to hold it or the clarity to cut it.I want to introduce my next guest, Mark Malik, the CIO of Seibert. Next and a Wall Street veteran since 1987. He distills real-time macro shifts in the clear, actual insights for investors. Please take a moment and welcome Mark Malick to the show. Mark, it's a pleasure to meet you and pleasure to have you here at the New York Stock. Great to be here.Look, I'm a little bit, let, let's start by this because I would like the guests to kind of introduce themselves a little bit to the audience so they understand why you and I are talking. OK, so go ahead. OK, been doing this almost as long as you have. Taking a slight different path than you, you look like you've been doing as long as I have. Well, look, I, I have leaders to follow, so you know, I have to look look like I know what I'm talking about. You do. And so my path was a little bit more sort of quantitative and so my background is really more technology oriented, uh, and I.I took a couple of detours in the finance world but mainly sort of tech-oriented and ultimately I started my own quant firm back in the early, uh, in the early oughts and ultimately ended up getting acquired by Seibert and my firm became the basis for their asset management company and I joined as their CIO and it has been love ever since. How great is that? This is gonna be a fascinating conversation because I've got a lot of my own views on the technology and actually what technology and all.did to, you know, my career, but did to really the, to the New York Sun change in the way that people invest. So, so let's talk about, tell us a little bit about your quantitative, kind of your, your history there and what got you into it. Yeah, so, you know, quantitative can mean so many different things, right? Uh, most people think of quantitative, they think of these high frequency traders and things like that. I never did any of that stuff. I basically use the quantitative methods to help me pick stocks better, manage portfolios better, to allocate.So that I can do on my own what it would take maybe 20 analysts in the old days to do. So that's always my start. So define that when you say the quantitative methods, define that for the audience, right? So I'm basically gonna do everything that you would do, right? So when I started, you know, quantitative meaning you, you would do math on the back of a trade ticket, right? And you have your Monroe trader over here, you're clicking away trying to figure it all out. The first step away from that was to use a spreadsheet and start to apply statistics, right? And so back then IStarted doing that in the early 90s and I was kind of like the, the one-eyed guy in the land of the blind, everyone was still walking around with, you know, like those little, you know, solar calculators and I was using a spreadsheet. I was high tech. But you know, as, as technology progressed, the power progressed and I was able to do much, much more. But I'm still looking at the same stuff that you would look, I'm look at. I'm just looking, looking at the technicals, I'm looking at factors. I'm looking at the standard fundamentals, but I'm applying levels of statistics on top of.That to sort of give myself a better idea of probabilities, right? So you probably use probabilities you probably inherently know them because of your experience, but I'm actually calculating the number, taking the guesswork out of it. So yours is probably more precise than mine is, you know what, but it's gonna be based on the same stuff. I like to say I'm doing exactly what you would do if you had a chance to do it every day over 3000 stocks, right? So basically I'm able to do that and again eliminate.You know, a lot of the ones that we shouldn't be looking at and then focus and going deeper on the ones that we should be looking at. All right, so let's talk about the 3000 stocks. So they, they span stocks here at the New York Stock Exchange as well as stocks on NASDAQ. Yeah, basically like to look at the whole universe, the whole universe, and then you're going to eliminate stocks that don't fit the criteria.Right, but, but, but that doesn't mean you're eliminating sectors. You're just eliminating individual names. Exactly. And then I might look in there based on what sectors we like because we're also gonna look at sectors and decide which sectors have the greatest probability to make a move, uh, and then of course it still has to fit a thesis at the end of the day, as you saidearlier. You're gonna look at the sectors that have probably to make a move.In the current environment. So, the conversation today might be very different than it will be 6 months from now or 6 monthsago. Correct. Correct. So today I might be saying, OK, it's time for us to consider some, you know, defensive type stocks, right? Uh, that may not be the case, but, you know, it is. And so now, yeah, and so now I, I got to decide within the defense, defensive, you know, universe, which ones am I gonna look at that will fit these rights. So it's interesting. Let's just make sure that the audience understands defensive versus defense.Yes, correct, correct, because some people sometimes get that view. So we want to talk about when we talk about defensive, talk about consumer staple names, you might be talking about essentially Staples plus are you in that space. They kind of are, um, but I look at everything, right? So at that point, I'm starting to look at, OK, what are the best things here? What, so it's different for everybody. You might be looking for growth in those in staples, which is not typically associated with staples, but if you look for it, maybe you can find it. So you're basically gonna look for the best names in that, in that group.The ones that have the best sort of factor exposure that we like at the time and that changes and that becomes sort of, you know, the, the, the beginnings of OK these five names came up, right? You know, Pepsi, no Coke maybe Walmart, yes, right. So then you start to say, OK, what might be my thesis around this? It's the same stuff that you would do, and then you're gonna do the the legwork as you said on the top of the show, right? Then you gotta get into it. You gotta read the 10 K's, you gotta read the 10 Q's, you gotta read every bit of news. You gotta do much more.On top of that, but that all those algorithms really the starting point, ones with the best probability. So, so is it the algorithm, uh, are you creating then an algorithm based on your data, so you're creating an algorithm with a bunch of names, or are you using the algorithms to help you discern the discern it's a lot of different things, right? So if you're picking individual stocks, we use, let's say the algorithms the factor models to narrow it down to a universe that we want to look at, right? And then we start to develop stocks that we're interested in and then of course we use.Other algorithms to help us allocate those stocks, right? So you know, as you also said earlier, you know, you want, there are times when you wanna be con you know concentrated in a few stocks right when they're when they're pulling for you, but you know if you're over, you know, so if you're over diversified and the market's moving, it can also cost you. So we're constantly evaluating how to what type of conviction we might have, uh, you know, on each one of those stocks that we ultimately pick and that's a whole separate group of models that we use. So, so then here's the question, does that.Model does that method methodology change doesn't change very frequently. It's not like from week to week you're changing your, no, not at all. So I have the benefit of being very long term oriented, right? So our clients are long term oriented and oriented clients. So I could sit here and say very easily is this not gonna be up in 2 years, right? And so it's a much easier process than saying I better get in now. Don't get me wrong, we're still looking.At the short term technicals to see if there are indicators that show us that we have some short term momentum and the trends and all that kind of stuff that we're looking at that you probably would also look at, um, and, uh, you know, we're certainly not buying, you know, when things are going straight down with, with, with negative momentum and things like that. Uh, but that said, we're looking at stocks that we think are going to do well over the next, let's say 4 to 8 quarters, right? And then once we have that, then we're constantly reevalu. All right, so let me ask you a question. So you're not necessarily buying stocks when they're falling out of bed. It's like catching a falling knife, right? You're gonna kind of, you have to kind of step back and just let it happen. But then at some point it hits the bottom and then these names become very attractive. Correct. Yeah, absolutely. We're seeing a lot of that now. We're seeing a lot of that now. I agree with you. Look, I think while the market, and look, today is another day, the market's just under pressure again, right? There's a lot going on, um.But I do think that we've put in the lows, like that 4835 that we hit maybe 3 weeks ago. I, I think that's actually the lows. It doesn't mean we're not going to test it again. We very well might. And actually, we probably should just to see if, if they defend the position, right? But I do think that in times like this there are stocks that end up becoming very interesting to look at and we're talking about big mega cap names. Absolutely. They're great, they're names.We loved a long time ago and we were buying them much richer when they are now. The markets are down. The macro climate has changed drastically and changes every 15 minutes drastically, uh, but, but, you know, at the end of the day, there's still the thesis test, right? Does it still match the thesis, right? Are the fundamentals the same? Now, fundamentals are going to probably shift a little in the, in the coming weeks with earnings, but that said, we'reConstantly doing that check. Most of these companies that we probably both loved, you and I a couple of weeks ago, a couple of months ago, are even better buys down here 100%. I don't care if it goes down further from here. I'd rather, you know, I'm fine with that. Well, you, you just said it, as long as the thesis itself, it's holding, right? If the thesis that you originally owned it still stands and the stocks on on sale 20%, that's more of a reason to buy it. I don't see.People canceling Nvidia orders, you know what I'm saying, and I, no, I, no, 100%. And look, I always laugh because I say it's like, you know, when, when Bluingdale's has a sale, everything goes on sale 30%. The ladies run in and they buy 3 dresses because how could you leave it on the shelf? But there's, but there's still junk out there. You gotta be real careful. I understand. But if they're buying a high quality dress, that's on sale, they're gonna buy, right? So when Apple's on sale, 28% orydia's down 25%, those are.Things that aren't going anywhere, right? They Nvidia sits at the nexus of this whole AI movement that's absolutely and that and that opportunity has not changed. That's exactly and that's the point. It hasn't changed not at all. This hasn't really changed not at all at all. Now there are some stocks absolutely that you say, oh, they stink, right? They're falling out of me. OK. The thesis there is changed. I gotta get out. I always say the big question is, is it down for the right reason or the wrong reason, right? Sometimes it's down for the wrong reason. This is a very, very uncomfortable market.It is very hard to find conviction here. However, if you do the math, you do your homework and you know what you're doing and you don't just blindly buy whatever your friends are telling you, you will find that there's some fantastic socks that are on sale right now. It may not be the bottom bottom. You can sit and.Wait for it to re-trend and build up momentum, which is fine also, but if you have a strong enough conviction and you have time and you understand your risk parameters, you can find stocks right now. This is a buyer's market right now. Alright, so hold on one minute. We're gonna take a break or we're gonna come right back. You bet.All right, we're back and I want to pick up that conversation from where we left off because I think what's really important about what you just said it was, you know, if, if you own the stock, you own the stock, the thesis is right, it hasn't changed, the stock is down, you may not hit the bottom yet, butIt's down 25%. It's still a name. It's OK to jump in there and buy. You're not necessarily always gonna buy at the very, at the bottom tick. You're just not. But you also have to understand, people go, well, if I missed the bottom, if a stock is down 25%, it's not trading up 25% in one day, right? It's just not. You're gonna get the opportunity to add to it. Absolutely, absolutely. And, and like I said, if you're fine.Following the rules and the guidelines that you set for yourself and you understand your risk parameters, you will find that it is not difficult, especially in a market like this, to justify making purchases. And so I think what's important with that statement too is you people have to understand their risk they have to know what their risk parameters are. The people I think that are really stressed out and nervous during this.Recent turmoil that we're all going through are the people that maybe don't understand their risk enough or maybe they've never really done their own risk assess assessment to understand what their risk is, right? I think it's very important that people understand kind of how much risk they're willing to endure. Absolutely, absolutely, and, and that's why I would also say a big part of my job is education, right? So, so it's educating clients so that they understand what's going on and I understand what they're thinking.Right, so that they understand that, OK, markets go up and down. They understand why the markets are down. They understand why they own the stock, and they understand that we follow a very, very strict set of guidelines, a strict set of guidelines. Exactly. And that makes it easy, right? It makes it easier. Well, it, it makes it easier. It doesn't necessarily take away the angst. Well, the pain is still there. There's no way taking away the pain. But you know I always have this conversation. People say to me, I've lost so much money. I go, no, no, no, you haven't actually lost it unless you make the sale.and take the loss. If you haven't made the sale and taken a loss, you know, it's just part of the cycle because, because if you've got high quality names, they're coming back. Look, I want, before we run out of time, I have to, we have to talk about this because I think you and I are in the same place, but, uh, but I, I, you know, I, I read your note that you put out and I, and I, I'm, I'm fascinated by it because I think we are in the same place. But tell me what you think about all the noise around Trump and Fed Chair power. Well, first of all, I think it's dangerous, uh, you know, for the president to be threatening to fire to fire the chair. Like I understand that the president would like to jawbone the chair, and that's understandable. What president doesn't want low interest rates, uh, but the reality is, is, you know, is firing the chairman of the largest central bank in the world kind of doesn't help when your currency is already, you know, people are looking at it sideways and they're looking at our sovereign debt sideways, you know, now may not be the time.To be doing that. But to say, hey, you know, lower interest rates could certainly help the market. We hope that we don't miss it this time. That's OK. We expect that. OK, yes, but I gotta tell you, I'm in the camp right now as I look around.I don't think Raejurius by any stretch, and I don't necessarily think that he needs to cut them right now because I don't think the macro data suggested. And I think all the trade angst is actually causing him to be a little bit more cautious, which I think is OK. Look, I agree he was late to the party when inflation was running out of control.But I'm not necessarily sure that he's, that he's gonna be late to the party this time because I think there's a lot of unknowns there and I think he's trying to stay steady, which I think is the right thing to do. You, you have 5 bullets in your gun. Someone has broken into your house. It's completely dark. You don't see or hear anything. You take a shot into the dark.No, no, you're absolutely right. And, and let's think about it. What would a 25 basis point rate cut do for the market 0? Any there is sure there's angst. Sure there are people out there that will say, oh God, thank God the Fed is cutting. I'm gonna buy, but they're gonna probably lose money the next day. But in terms of fixing some of the challenges that we might have, should these tariffs stay, then that's a very different case. And that, quite frankly, you might not be able to solve those problems with lower.Interest rates. So like Fed funds rates. So the fact of the matter is, is if, if you're the Fed chair and you have more ammo than they've had in the last 20 years to use, why waste it, right? Wait till you start to see things crumble. And, and by the way, uh, I don't think the hard data is crumbling yet. I think the hard data continues to reflect that the economy is still fairly robust. I would agree with you, but that's today, you know, I, I'm a little, I'm a little, you know.Uncomfortable with the soft data. Uh, a lot of people have been poo poohing the soft data, but I'm a, a real big fan of, you know, consumer sentiment, right? I believe that yes, maybe there's not a direct correlation, but if consumers are showing and both parties, right, so I'm not saying it's biased because you can watch the parties certainly on the UMish one, right? And so we have an idea that everyone's getting a little nervous, but are they getting nervous because of all the chaos thatCould be that's being created are they really getting nervous because they think either they're gonna lose their job or they're gonna be out of, or the, you know, the economy's very good, very good point. So that's where I'm at, right? I, I.While I look at the soft data, I'm just not there yet. Yeah, I'm not ready to call a recession on this stuff, but it's certainly we got to watch this very, very carefully. It comes down to doing your homework and understanding kind of how it all plays together.Let's wrap up things with three essential market tips to keep in mind no matter which way the wind blows, right? Start a watch lists before you start buying. Before you invest a single dollar, build a simple watchlist of companies that you're interested in. Brands you know, products you use.News or industries that you're curious about. Track how these stocks move day to day and then what news impacts them and then how they react. This helps you learn how the market reacts without risking real money just yet. It's like training wheels for investing, right? Everybody should at least do that when they're starting out.The second thing, do not check your portfolio every hour while it's tempting to refresh the app constantly and go in and constantly check it out. Short-term market moves can mess with your emotions. Instead, pick 1 or 2 times a week to review the portfolio, remind yourself why you're investing in the first place. Long-term investing is a marathon. It is not a minute by minute sprint.And use fractional shares to build positions slowly, right? You don't need to buy a whole share of Amazon or Apple and maybe you can't even afford to do that yet, right? Most platforms now let you invest small amounts, $5.10 dollars, $50 at a time using fractional shares. This lets you gradually build a portfolio while learning how each investment performs. It's a great way to invest consistently even if you're on a budget. OK.So now here's the food for thought because you know I always end the show with a recipe and I gave you this recipe. It's nidi di tagliateelli. It's talliatellli nests. It's not just pasta, it's really a statement. You gotta picture these golden coils of fresh egg pasta all rolled up. Looks like a little nest, right? This, this was born in Emilia Romana, the food capital of Italy. Legend has it that a Bolognese.created them in 1487 to honor Rulezia Borgia, whose golden hair at her wedding was all rolled up in a nest. Now, that's setting the bar a little high, but it's not just about the looks. These nests mean business. They soak up the flavor like a stock soaks up a rally. You serve them with a rich ragout or a creamy sauce or a bright tomato base. Whatever you're working with, they rise to the.Asia. Now here's a pro tip. You can make the ragu a day ahead to save time and it even sits overnight. It's even better. These make, and once you make these, these make killer leftovers. You just reheat them in the oven with a splash of sauce and boom, you've got round 2. Now you want to go an extra mile? Try it, Alorno. You arrange the raw nest in a par cooked, uh, in a, in a, in a, in a baking dish, uh.And you stuff them with bocconcini, right? Those little mozzarella balls, you pour the sauce on the top, you cover them and you bake them in the oven until they're nice and golden. It's pure magic. The dish is a Sunday staple in Italian homes and a showstopper in restaurants around the world. It's got roots style, flavor to spare. And hey, if you want my take on it, scan the QR code on the screen for the full recipe, you'll thank me later.That's a wrap for today's Trader talk, but the conversation keeps going.

        "content": "You can catch Opening Bid onApple Podcasts,Spotify,YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The pros say theUS\u2013China tariff thawis not a deal, but rather a thaw in the ordeal triggered by the Trump administration. Whatever it is, the stock market likes the fact that US tariffs on China will be going down to30% from 145% for the next 90 daysas US and China officials negotiate further. The verdict is out on several fronts, however. For one, tariffs are still in place on China, and there is no guarantee they will all be removed. There is also no guarantee that there won't be a renewed escalation. Two, the US economy has started to weaken in the face of considerable policy uncertainty, and experts are not ruling out a mild recession. What that means for Fed policy will likely dictate how stocks trade throughout the summer. Yahoo Finance Executive EditorBrian Sozziwelcomes former US Commerce SecretaryWilbur Rossto theOpening Bidroundtable. Ross served in the first Trump administration when the then first-time president enacted tariffs. He has also known Trump for decades, gaining keen insight into how he operates on delicate matters. What's next in the trade war for investors? If there's anyone who might have an educated guess, it's business mogul turned policy expert Ross. Welcome to a new episode of the opening bid podcast. I'm Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sai. Like I always say this, the podcast that will make you a smarter investor, period. And of course opening bid sponsored by our friends at Vanguard, big special guest here on the podcast, returning to opening bid is former Commerce Secretary Mr. Wilbur Ross. Mr. Secretary, good to see you again. It's been a while. Good to see you. Yeah, I appreciate it. Yeah, it's good to, uh, see you here at the, uh, NASDAQ in Times Square, and I went back.To every time you've been on this podcast, and I have to say, Mr. Secretary, you've been right, uh, every single time on tariffs. Now we've had a big breakthrough which I'm sure you saw, uh, agreement between the US and China stocks soared. We're here at the Nasdaq tech stocks really ripped higher. Are markets too optimistic based on your understanding of what was agreedupon? Well, I, I don't think so. I think the only reason.Markets got really dizzy for a while was fear of the unknown because for a while it looked like maybe there was no real plan, maybe there was no real exit ramp. Well, now with the small deal with the UK and potentially very big deal with China, market sees there is a path.And market knows India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, a whole bunch of others are in the wings waiting to make deals as well. And I should note, of course, a key member of the first Trump administration, you were in the trenches negotiating tariffs in that first administration, but now we're in this new what.90 day period and we're taping this I guess it's 89 days now. Um, what advice would you give to the administration, uh, during this key time? Sure. Well, there are a couple of big issues that haven't been addressed. One is market access. The tariffs are one thing, but market access is another very big deal. Intellectual property being respected, big deal, and maybe most of all enforcement.Remember we made a deal with China, the so-called phase one, but they never implemented it. And then when the Biden administration came in, they didn't seem to have much interest in it anyway, so we really need an enforcement mechanism. Does the US to get some of those things you're talking about here or to get the ball over the finish line.Is the administration going to have to give something up or several things? Well, I think they're giving things up relative to where they were in terms of the announcements that preceded, but they're not gonna be giving things up relative to where we were before the recent announcement. Are you confident that after the now the 89 days there's something definitive on the table because going back to my first question, I think that's what that's why the markets cheered this. I think investors were quick to price in maybe the trade war with China is over. Well, I don't think it will ever quite be over, but what will be over are these tariffs up there over 100%. But you know, once a tariff gets over 40 or 50%, it doesn't.It doesn't make much difference if you add more on top because you've really said, we're not doing any business with you. It's not absorbable even at 40 or 50, let alone at 125 or 135. What lessons, I mean, you've been in the room with the Chinese. These are high pressure talks. What have you learned by negotiating withthem? Well, they're very tough. They're very determined and very well prepared, um, so the real question is, have they made up their mind that.Time to get serious. I believe they have and including not just regular tariffs, but I think we're gonna get a lot of progress on fentanyl. They had an extremely high security person from China at this talk uh that just occurred.That's the first time they've done that. Well, it's the security part of China that has to deal with fentanyl because they don't have a domestic fentanyl issue. You never hear about drug problems in China because they're very strict, but they've actually been subsidizing export of fentanyl. What do you think um made the Chinese blink? Oh, I think seeing that Trump wasn't kidding, I mean him imposing over 100, he put in first the tariff, then when they responded, he jumped way up. You toldme you told me 6 months ago, quote, the president was deadly serious about tariffs, and he escalated it very quickly. He certainly has proven to be.And I think they got that. I think they also, uh, realized something else.In the first administration, the president didn't have very good control of the Republican Party, and he didn't have very good control of the Senate and the House. Now the majorities are very slim, but he's got pretty much control, so that means.He's the decision maker. We don't have to worry too much about it going back into the legislature, so that's a change, big change. The other thing that's a big change is in the first administration we were probing what are the legislative mechanisms.That exist and that we could use to give the present tariff power. Well, we found Section 20301, Section 232 and IEA, all of which are based on national emergency or national defense.And that's why you notice this time he's not putting anything to the Congress. He's doing it all by his own order. That's why you've seen so much activity so quickly.And why he feels unconstrained about the levels. Now for those not familiar with your career, you've, you've known the President Trump for decades back when he was, you know, a real estate mogul and a businessman. What do you think his next move will be with China? Well, the next move will be to finalize a big deal. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and as I mentioned, there are these other issues the fentanyl, the intellectual property, uh, and market access, and there's finally a complicated one. They use some junk science to keep our agricultural products out.Those are the issues that haven't been addressed to any real degree in this little thing, but the very fact that during the pause period, China was willing to accept materially higher tariffs than we're having because he kept in place the base tariff that he's talking about for the world plus added something to it. So they're at about 30%, we're at about 10%. I talked to a lot of CEOs, uh, Mr. Secretary, and if there's any theme that ties these conversations together, they've been confused by the negotiating strategy on tariffs. What do you tell the CEO community that is just trying to, to meet a quarter, meet a cash flow number, and keep their employees happy? Well, what I, what I keep telling them, and I have been telling them, is that the end result is going to be a good end result, um.And that they shouldn't let the interim noise distract them because it's all it is, is interim noise. It's not a permanent thing. And I've been telling him he has no intention of staying at 100 and some odd%. There's no point to being that high.I also think that longer term if they apply reciprocity on the way down just as they more or less are on the way up we could end up with lower tariffs. Doyou think the CEOs should expect that they will now have to operate in a land of tariffs for the next decade? I mean, are tariffs the new normal for the US versus the rest of the world? Well, people forget from the days of the American Revolution right through World War II, tariffs were the main source of revenue to the US federal government, so tariffs are nothing, nothing new.Um, what changed after World War II, we decided to help rehabilitate Europe and Asia, both with direct aid like the Marshall Plan and with indirect aid like.That was a good idea, but it should have been time limited. There's no reason to give China the same concessions in 2025 as you would give them in 1947. The whole world has changed. They've changed, but instead of time limiting it, we locked it in first with the GATT and then subsequently with the WTO. Has President Xi, China's President Xi, been bolstered his standing in the world been bolstered because of the situation? I think they've both been, um, it's not correct to say that Xi blinked. Um, I, I don't think it's correct to say that either one blinked.Nor frankly other than for their own political purposes do I think it makes any difference whatsoever. The real key is, are we going to find a level that reduces our trade deficit with China. All right, stay right there, Mr. Secretary, we'll be right back on opening bid. We're gonna go off for a quick break.All right, welcome back to opening bid here at the NASDAQ in Times Square, and of course opening bid sponsored by our friends at Vanguard, having a great chat here with former Commerce Secretary Mr. Wilbur Ross. I, I wanna get your sense of the economy, um, because, uh, we just had, uh, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler.She said that tariffs are likely to generate significant economic effects if they stayed at current levels. Would you agree with that? Well, if they were to stay at 100 some odd%, surely, but that's never really been in the cards. That was just a mechanism for getting the talks going.Plus, you can't really just look at tariffs independently. Remember, he's also got a whole tax program coming through, and that's gonna have enormous impact.Giving a $4000 credit tax credit against Social Security is huge. Tens of millions of families depend on Social Security, and an extra $4000 means a lot to those people. It's 300 some odd dollars a month net net net in their pocket.And people on Social Security have a very high propensity to consume. They will spend that money. Similarly, abating the tax on overtime is a very good thing. People are a little bit loath to do overtime nowadays. They prefer lifestyle to wages, butMaking it tax free will be an incentive and that's important because in many of these sectors it's gonna take a couple of years to build our capacity to where we can be self-sufficient, but if you start out with overtime, you can have a bridge toward that gap. So that's a very important thing.Further, people haven't noticed, but it's gonna make the interest you pay on buying a car tax deductible.Well, a huge percentage of automobiles are financed, and so that makes a very big difference. You'll notice in the TV ads, the car companies don't even talk about the price. They talk about how much per month. Well, now if they're tax deductible, how much per month they've just gone down. Even in,even in light of some of those measures, you still have uh an investment bank like Goldman Sachs.After the trade agreement with China, they, they were at a 45% chance for recession this year. Now they're at 35%. Would you agree with their probability? Well, there's probably always a 20 or 25% chance of a recession, and it's been many years since we had a real recession. COVID, uh, you have to put to the side because that was not an economic recession that had to do with the horrible epidemic.So it's been a long time and we're therefore due to recession at some point. My biggest worry in terms of whether there will be a recession is Jay Powell and his antipathy toward the president, their mutual.antipathy makes it less likely that he'll be reducing rates as soon as I would prefer that he do so. Should he be fired as the president has suggested? Well, it's not at all clear that the president can fire.Uh, the head of the Federal Reserve. My guess is if it were clear, Trump would have fired him in the first administration. So I, I would be very surprised to see an effort to do that, uh, and that would be litigated in any event. So by the time he got done with it, his term will have expired. His term expires pretty soon. To be fair to JP Powell, it's hard to cut rates because they're concerned about the inflation outlook. Where do you stand on tariffs equating to inflation? Do you think we will see inflation soon? Well, where I disagree with him about the impact of tariffs on inflation is this You can make the case there will be a one-time step up in inflation, but unless the tariffs kept going up as a percentage.There's no reason to believe that it'll be incrementally more the next year and the next year. So I don't agree with the argument that, uh, tariffs justify fears of continuing inflation.I, I just don't think so. And when you start getting down to low levels like 10%, 20%, a lot of that is absorbable anyway. What do you think about, you know, now there's reports that, you know, given that backdrop of tariffs, potential inflation, Apple CEO Tim Cook looking at price increases for his products, even if tariffs are removed. Well, uh, Apple are very clever strategists, and remember their purpose is not to boost or not boost the economy. Their purpose is to maximize profit, so they will clearly use whatever strategy accomplishes that goal. And you are in the in your term as commerce secretary, you work closely with the semiconductor industry, a lot of, a lot of tech players. Should investors believe Tim Cook that he really wants to make products in the US? Oh, I think he will make products where it makes the most sense. You'll notice what he started with is moving assembly out of China to India.Well, I think it won't be long before he moves the rest out as well. Reason being this within China, which like India is a great huge land mass, within China, ground transportation is very good, very good railroads, very good highways.India transportation is not so good, so it's going to be a lot more complicated getting the parts to India to the factories for assembly than it was in China. So I think this is just the start of moving more out. Now moving a factory to India doesn't particularly help us.But, um, what will help us is as the demand grows and as they source the semiconductors from the US as opposed to elsewhere, that will help. Do you believe we can make.iPhones in America and that will actuallyhappen physically we certainly could physically. We have the technology um whether we will end up doing it, I don't know, but there are a lot of high value components to it. The last bit of assembly is not the highest value.Uh, to the product, and some of that worked very closely on with semiconductors, uh, in, in the first presidency, curious on what you think about.The export controls on on AI chips with China sounds like we've had a little bit of a breakthrough there, but what's your sense of where things, I think it's essential. I think it's quite important that we be the leaders in both semiconductor and in AI, and as you may remember, I spent a couple of years.Getting TSMC, the highest tech one from Taiwan to put their next factory in Arizona, and then they pushed for the chips Act, which finally went through. It took a little time. It took too long, but at least it got through. But what's interesting.TSMC, since you didn't have Americans who were trained how to make chips, and it's a very highly technical process, and you're working in tiny, tiny areas, so there's no room for margin of error. So TSMC took hundreds of American workers, sent them to Taiwan at their expense for 6 months to train them. Now they've.Come back in their work and TSMC says productivity in Arizona is actually better than the productivity in Taiwan. Well, we start getting stories like that in high tech it'll make up for the higher wages. You know, you've beenright a lot of times on this program about tariffs and where things are going, moving forward, what's your biggest remaining concern or concerns regarding US trade policy? Um, my biggest concerns are the enforcement, um, because it looks as though he's going to have different tariffs for the same product depending on which country they come from. Problem with that is if you're a high tariff country, you're gonna find a way to move them through a low tariff country. So what we.the missing piece is to get the low tariff countries to put barriers so that you won't have the transshipment or other devices to get around the high tariffs in say China. That's the most complicated part because that requires all those local countries to change their tariff regimes. Alright, we're gonna leave it there. Always nice to get some time with you.

        "header": "Is NVIDIA (NVDA) the Best Quantum Computing Stock to Invest in Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best quantum computing stocks to invest in now. When AI first gained widespread attention a few years ago, much of the conversation focused on its potential to boost productivity, streamline data analysis, and improve efficiency within businesses. While AI has certainly made an impact in those areas, its capabilities extend far beyond. Lesser-known but equally important applications of AI include optimizing drug development processes, detecting financial fraud, and strengthening cybersecurity systems. However, achieving significant breakthroughs in these complex fields will require more advanced AI systems. That\u2019s where quantum computing enters the picture. Although quantum technology hasn\u2019t yet been fully integrated with AI, its potential to unlock new levels of performance and problem-solving is immense, offering a powerful future synergy between the two fields. Quantum computing is a new type of computing that uses the strange rules of quantum physics to solve really hard problems. Unlike regular computers that use bits (which are either 0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits), which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. This lets them handle a lot more information at once. Qubits can also be linked together in a special way called entanglement, which makes them even more powerful. Although today\u2019s quantum computers are still early and not perfect, they\u2019re improving fast and could one day change fields like medicine, finance, and cybersecurity. In a recent CNBC interview, Executive Chair & Chairman of the Board of IonQ, provided insights into the company\u2019s strategy and vision for the future of quantum computing and its integration with artificial intelligence. Chapman explains that the company uses a unique approach to building quantum computers based on trapped-ion technology, which offers greater stability and scalability than other quantum systems. This method allows for more precise control over qubits, which is essential for solving complex computational problems currently beyond classical computers\u2019 reach. Chapman discusses how quantum computing can significantly enhance AI capabilities. Traditional AI algorithms, especially those involving large datasets and intricate optimization challenges, are limited by the processing power of classical systems. Quantum computers, however, have the potential to process exponentially larger datasets and perform calculations that would otherwise take years. This could lead to breakthroughs in areas like drug discovery, supply chain optimization, and financial modeling. The former CEO also highlighted the company\u2019s focus on practical applications rather than just theoretical advancement. The company is actively developing quantum algorithms specifically designed to complement AI models, and it is working with major tech firms and research institutions to accelerate real-world adoption. Chapman envisions a future where quantum computing becomes a critical tool for AI development, enabling smarter, faster, and more efficient solutions across industries. To compile the list of 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Invest in Now, we conducted thorough research, analyzing multiple financial media reports and industry reports. Starting with an initial list of 20 companies, we narrowed it down by choosing pure-play quantum computing stocks that are popular among elite hedge funds. The final selection is ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q4 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) supports quantum computing primarily through its advanced hardware and software platforms that accelerate quantum research and simulation. While not building quantum hardware, NVIDIA plays a crucial role in enabling hybrid quantum-classical computing via its CUDA Quantum platform, which integrates classical GPU computing with quantum circuits. This helps researchers and developers simulate quantum algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs, speeding up quantum software development. Partnerships with leading quantum hardware companies further position NVIDIA as an essential enabler in the broader quantum ecosystem. According to Reuters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently introduced CUDA-Q, an open-source platform designed to facilitate the development of quantum applications. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between classical and quantum computing, enabling researchers to leverage CUDA\u2019s parallel processing power for quantum simulations and optimizations. Notably, NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with French quantum computing firm Pasqal exemplifies this integration, as Pasqal plans to incorporate CUDA-Q into its quantum computing units and cloud platform, thereby providing a high-performance computing interface for the quantum community. Additionally, at the NVIDIA GTC 2025 conference, the company unveiled CUDA-X, a suite of libraries optimized for its new GH200 and GB200 superchips. These libraries offer up to 11x speedups for computational engineering tools and support calculations up to five times larger than traditional architectures, further enhancing CUDA\u2019s utility in complex quantum and AI workloads. Overall, NVDAranks 3rdon our list of best quantum computing stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "content": "The next front in the AI arms race isn\u2019t Beijing. It\u2019s in Riyadh, at least according to Wedbush. A new memo from the firm, released early Wednesday, portrayed this week\u2019s U.S.-Saudi forum as a major bullish shift in global tech power dynamics. President Donald Trump arrived in the Saudi capital on Tuesday to a lavish reception,escortedby six Royal Saudi F-15 fighter jets. On the ground, he was joined by a who\u2019s who of U.S. tech, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Ruth Porat. Wedbush estimates the Saudi Arabian AI opportunity could add $1 trillion to the globe\u2019s total AI addressable market. A sweeping new partnership between Nvidia and Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign AI initiative, Humain, was the focus of the gathering. Under the deal, Nvidia will sell 18,000 next-gen Blackwell chips to power the Kingdom\u2019s first supercomputer. Over the next five years, Saudi Arabia plans to build out a network of AI data centers to train and deploy sovereign models as part of its Vision 2030 push to diversify away from oil. In tandem, Nvidia stocksoaredalmost 6% on Tuesday and climbed another 3% before Wednesday\u2019s opening bell, in a two-day rally sparked in large part by the news. A move like that for a company Nvidia\u2019s size is worth roughly $300 billion in market value \u2013 equal to Palantir\u2019s (PLTR) entire market cap, for context. Days before the trip, the U.S. Commerce Departmentrescindedthe Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule, a sweeping framework that would have imposed tiered export controls across dozens of countries. As Bloombergreported, the Trump administration plans to replace it with a more flexible, transactional approach, easing restrictions for close allies like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and tightening them for countries less in favor, including China and Malaysia. Whether the news is unambiguously bullish is another matter. The reversal of U.S. policy introduces new layers of uncertainty. There\u2019s the ethical and strategic risk of handing sovereign AI capabilities to authoritarian states. And while transactional diplomacy may unlock short-term access in some markets, it replaces a rules-based system with case-by-case dealmaking. Critics warn that this shift could fragment AI-related laws, regulations, and oversight. In short, one AI Cold War may be easing. Another looks to be unfolding. \u201cWho controls A.I. is the geopolitical question of our time,\u201d Jim Secreto, a former deputy chief of staff at the Commerce Department, told theNew York Times. For the Trump administration, that question is becoming less about containment and more about cutting deals. For the latest news,Facebook,TwitterandInstagram.",

Ross served as the 39th US Commerce Secretary from 2017 to 2021 and is the author of \"Risks and Returns: Creating Success in Business and Life.\"During his tenure, Ross helped implement Trump's first tariffs on China. \"Once a tariff gets over 40% or 50%, it doesn't make much difference if you add more on top because you've really said, we're not doing any business with you,\" Ross added. \"It's not absorbable even at 40% or 50%, let alone at 125% or 135%.\" TheUS and China agreed on Mondayto ratchet down the tariff war for 90 days as each economy begins to feel the pressure of bruising penalties. After a weekend of high-level meetings in Switzerland, the US will reduce \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods from China to 10% from 125%.

NVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.  Bank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.  Nvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy \u201cmore than a million\u201d of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.  U.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.  Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.  In a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: \u201cFor investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. \u201d  \u201cWhile we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.\u201d  Investors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.  Additionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.  Previously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.  Shares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.  The artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.  The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.  The department also said that \u201cthe use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.\u201d Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.  \u201cHuawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),\u201d Bernstein's Rasgon said.  \u201cHowever, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,\u201d he added. \u201cThis could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.\u201d",

        "header": "This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis.",
        "content": "I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.  **Some quick points:**  **1. Price to earnings ratio**  Price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.  The entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.  Who in the world would be interested in signing up for that \"investment\" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.  **2. The Buffett indicator**  The Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.  Historically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.  **3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**  The Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.  Side note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?  **4. Home prices and the Housing Market**  I won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.  Its highest percent\u00a0*until*\u00a0the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.   30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.  The condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.  Foreclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.  What happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?  What does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --  When homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.  **5. Consumer debt is through the roof**  Credit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.  Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.  **6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**  The US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.  **7. Commercial real estate**  A massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.  **8. Student Loan Debt**  The government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on? As I mentioned previously -- credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high -- and rising. How much worse does that get when 15% of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month?  There is a dozen other items I could list here, but in the interest of actually getting some work done today, I'll leave my post there.  I would genuinely love for someone to refute places I'm missing the mark, or why I may be wrong about my assumptions above.     Current options positions I hold:   11 $480 SPY puts Exp 9/19   Also holding 15 IBIT $70 calls expiring 9/19 as well",

        "content": "If you've just beenlaid offand retirement is around the corner, it may be stressful, especially if you were looking to save more before leaving the workforce. While you may feel powerless after a layoff, you still have options. With the right financial moves, you can protect your nest egg, reduce stress, and build a bridge towardsretirementthat will help you realize your long-term goals. The first move after being laid off is to step back and absorb what happened. Resist the urge to panic and start withdrawing funds from your retirement account. \"You have to address the emotional part first before you can get into any numbers or findings,\" saysCrystal Cox, CFP and SVP at Wealthspire Advisors. \"Things might look a little bit different, it's a shift in perspective, but you will be ok.\" Start by assessing your entire financial profile: How much do you have in savings? What expenses can you cut out or cut back on? Is your company providingseverance? For how long? Can youclaim unemployment? Are there other sources of support available to you? The goal is to optimize your cash flow before you start using long-term savings. You may even need to take on part-time work or consulting jobs to cover any holes in your finances. This may help you delay withdrawing retirement funds or claimingSocial Security. These strategies can add up to thousands of dollars in the long run. It may be tempting to use funds in your retirement accounts when you're short on cash. Butwithdrawingfrom a retirement account, such as a 401(k), before age 59\u00bd can come with taxes and penalties. Even if you can avoid that, you'll miss out on years of compound growth. \"Another common mistake...is claiming Social Security early, but that might not be the best decision,\" said Cox. You can claim Social Security as early as age 62. But if you collect at age 62, your monthly benefit will be reduced. However, if you're able to wait until full retirement age (FRA) to collect, which is age 67 for those born in 1960 and later, you'll receive a boost in your monthly benefit. Plus, if you're able to delay past FRA, your monthly benefits will increase 8% for every you wait, up to age 70. Instead, Cox suggests finding some type of employment that will bridge the gap before you reach FRA. And if you start claiming Social Security benefits early and realize it wasn't the best move, you still have some leeway. \"You can actually repay Social Security if you change your mind within the first year of claiming it,\" she adds. Beinglaid offwhen you are about to retire may force you to reassess your timeline. It doesn't mean you can't retire, but it may change when you retire. Think about working part-time or going intosemi-retirement. It may not be ideal, but it may allow you to transition to retirement in a way that is less stressful and more financially sound. Take stock of your current assets, Social Security income, and reduced expenses. It may turn out that delaying retirement by just a year or two will allow you to retire comfortably. As of April 2025, 32% of job seekers were unemployed for 27 weeks or more. Taking a lower-paying job or working fewer hours might feel like you're falling behind your retirement goals, but you're still building financial stability. The most important thing is to remain committed to your financial plan. By reducing spending, adjusting lifestyle expectations, and being consistent with retirement savings, your retirement future is still in sight. You just need to adjust how you will get there. Retirement savings can get tricky if you relied on contributing to a 401(k), which workplace retirement plans available through your employer. Yet not all employers offer one. If you are in that situation, you still have options\u2014you can consider opening a Roth individual retirement account (IRA) if you're eligible or a traditional IRA otherwise. \"Assuming you have additional cash flow that you can still put to work, IRAs are a great option,\" Cox says. \"EspeciallyRoth IRAs, if you've got income to support it.\" If you need financial advice but can't afford a financial advisor, look toAdvisers Give Back, an organization that matches individuals with financial advisers for free. Healthcare is one of the most challenging and stressful parts of being laid off.COBRAcan be an option in continuing your healthcare plan from employment, but it can pricey\u2014while your employer may have paid a portion of the premiums in the past, you may now be on the hook for their portion of the premium as well as your own, plus a 2% fee. Take the time to compare it against health plans on theHealth Insurance Marketplace. Many people may qualify for subsidies, which bring down premium costs. If you're 65 or older, look into how and when to sign up forMedicareto avoid late penalties. Getting laid off close to retirement can be difficult, but it doesn't mean your dreams of retirement are shattered. With some careful planning and adjustments, such as cutting costs, delaying withdrawals and Social Security, and taking on part-time work, you can still achieve a comfortable and secure retirement.",

Yet history shows that some of the market\u2019s biggest surges may arrive just before its darkest plunges. Byrecognizing the warning patterns, you can protect your portfolio from becoming another cautionary tale. Below, we take you throughparadigmatic moments of boom to bustto help you know what to look for. Throughout the Roaring Twenties, theDow Jones Industrial Averagerose ten\u2011fold, powered by easy credit and the widespread practice ofbuying on margin(borrowing up to 90\u202f% of a position). Optimistic pundits even declared that stocks had reached a \u201cpermanently high plateau.\u201d Selling pressure erupted on\u202fBlack\u202fThursday (Oct.\u202f24), intensified on Black\u202fMonday, and culminated on Black\u202fTuesday (Oct.\u202f29), when the Dow collapsed another 12\u202f%. Ticker\u2011tape backlogs forced traders to post prices hours late, amplifying panic. The market would lose nearly 90\u202f% by 1932,ushering in the Great Depressionand prompting landmark reforms such as the Securities Act of\u202f1933 and the formation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Speculative leverage and inadequate disclosure emerged as chief culprits\u2014warnings that still resonate. From 1995 to early\u202f2000, the Nasdaq soared over 400\u202f% as investors chased any firm with \u201c.com\u201d in its name.Initial public offeringprices could double in half a day, despite many companies having zilch in revenues. The fever broke in March\u202f\u202f2000, when the Nasdaq peaked above 5,000.Asinterest ratehikes, profit warnings, and a rotation out of tech hit, the index fell nearly 40\u202f% in eight weeks and almost 80\u202f% by late\u202f2002. About $5\u202ftrillion in market value evaporated, bankrupting scores of start\u2011ups.The Nasdaq would take another 14 years to reach its dot-com-era peak. Low interest rates and financial engineering turned U.S. housing into a speculative playground. Lenders issued sub\u2011prime mortgages that were repackaged into complex securities and snapped up by yield\u2011hungry investors\u2014fueling a stock rallythat pushed the Dow to a record high in October\u202f2007. Whenadjustable\u2011rate mortgages resetand defaults spiked, the edifice crumbled. Bear\u202fStearns imploded in March\u202f2008;Lehman\u202fBrothers collapsedthat September. The Dow logged its then\u2011largest point drop (\u2013777) on Sept.\u202f29, and global credit markets froze. World gross domestic product shrank for the first time in the post\u2011war era. Unemployment in the U.S. doubled, and trillions in wealth disappeared. Regulators responded withTARP,Basel\u202fIII, and theDodd\u2011Frank Actto curb systemic risk. The S&P\u202f500 notched more than 30 record closes in 2024, while AI\u2011centric hype pushed indices over 25%.Mega\u2011cap tech names now command valuations rivaling entire sectors. Meanwhile, corporate and household debt sit at historic highs, and real rates remain somewhat elevated. Wall Street is divided: Morgan Stanley sees only muted gains ahead, but Goldman\u202fSachs warns a demand shock or earnings miss could chop 20\u202f% off equities.Keeping an eye on earnings breadth, credit spreads, and liquidity conditions may help investors gauge whether enthusiasm has outrun fundamentals. The situation with theTrump tariffshas had those in the market very tentative about prognostications about what to expect. History doesn\u2019t repeat, but it rhymes. Every major crash has had a cocktail of easy money, euphoric narratives, and overlooked risks. When valuations stretch far beyond fundamentals and leverage becomes the norm, even a small spark can ignite a conflagration. Staying diversified, limiting margin, and watching for the classic warning signs can help you participate in rallies, without being the last one dancing when the music stops.",

        "content": "More young people are stepping off the career treadmill\u2014temporarily. Whether they call it a micro-retirement, an adult gap year, or a one-year sabbatical, the goal is the same: a purposeful break from full-time work without derailing long-term financial goals. One key to making that happen? Funding it through a brokerage account\u2014and not your401(k). Here's what you need to know about using a brokerage account to fund your micro-retirement. Unlike a 401(k) orRoth IRA, abrokerage accountallows you to withdraw funds at any time without early withdrawal penalties, making it an ideal vehicle for funding a micro-retirement. That\u2019s whyEric Maldonado, the founder of California-based Aquila Wealth Advisors, redirected his own retirement contributions into a brokerage account before taking what he calls a \u201cone-year working sabbatical.\u201d Avoiding theseearly withdrawal penaltiesis the major advantage of using a brokerage, according to Maldonado. Most qualified retirement accounts\u2014like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s\u2014have a 10% penalty on all withdrawals before age 59\u00bd on top of any income taxes owed, he adds. And while Roth IRAs offer more flexibility, Maldonado notes that a Roth IRA is \u201cmost effective\u201d when you allow forcompoundinggrowth over decades. \u201cAvoid killing the compounding effect of withdrawing from it early if at all possible,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you are going all in on the micro-retirement goal, a brokerage account is a smart place to redirect all new retirement savings contributions into,\u201d Maldonado says. He recommends starting as early as possible\u2014ideally five to seven years ahead\u2014and saving more than you think you'll need. \u201cAdd 20% to whatever you think you need to provide a buffer for contingencies,\u201d said Maldonado. Early on, you can invest for growth. But as your leave date nears, shift your savings intosafer assets. \u201cYou would most likely want to have your full year of expenses saved up and allocated into stable funds by the time you take a leave of absence,\u201d he says, citing options like amoney market fund,T-bills, orhigh-yield savings accounts. If you have large capital gains on your assets, you can ease your tax burden by selling them in two separate years\u2014half in December, and half in January. Before you start selling stocks or other assets in your brokerage account, be aware of the tax consequences. \u201cIf you have large capital gains in stock positions, you could be paying 15% to 20%long-term capital gains taxes,\u201d Maldonado notes. Consider splitting sales across two tax years\u2014half in December, half in January\u2014to ease the hit. He also cautions about income taxes on interest from bonds or money market funds. And just as important as tax planning? Exit planning. \u201cThe biggest risk is defaulting into an extended micro-retirement unintentionally,\u201d he says. To avoid a prolonged gap, set deadlines for starting your job search or becomingself-employed. A brokerage account offers the flexibility you need to take a career break without touching your 401(k). But that flexibility only works if you\u2019re proactive. To make the most of your micro-retirement, start planning years in advance, invest strategically, understand the tax implications, and above all, stay on track with your return-to-work goals to ensure your finances don't fall under unnecessary strain. \"We tend to underestimate how expensive life is without an income, and we tend to overestimate how much we can save in a year or two\u2014but don\u2019t underestimate the power of focusing on your goals,\" says Maldonado.",

        "content": "If you\u2019re looking to invest $20,000, financial advisors recommend starting with proven strategies like index funds.Chad Olivier, CEO of the Louisiana-based Olivier Group, told Investopedia that this approach allows you to build a broad portfolio with exposure to hundreds of stocks. This gives you more stability and less risk because you\u2019re spreading your investment across many companies and sectors. Whether you're a seasoned investor or a beginner, understanding how toallocate your funds effectively\u2014andavoiding emotional market buying or selling\u2014is key to long-term financial success. Before deciding to invest,take stock of your financesand consideralternatives. For example, if you\u2019re saddled withcredit card debt, you may want to pay it down and avoid paying more in monthly interest than you\u2019ll likely make on an investment. Contributing to your 401(k)or retirement plan can also be a smart move, especially if your employer offersmatching contributions, which effectively provide an immediate return on your investment. If you can invest $20,000, you might start with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which tracks theS&P 500. If you had done so 10 years ago, you\u2019d have about $63,851 in May 2025, yielding a total return (with dividends reinvested) of about 163%. If you invested the same amount in the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the tech-heavyNasdaq, you\u2019d have almost $97,558 in May 2025\u2014a total return (with dividends reinvested) of 388%. Once you\u2019ve built awell-diversified portfolio, Olivier suggests researching and investing inindividual stocks, which carry more risk than an index ETF but offer potentially higher returns in the long run. In particular, Olivier recommends investing in well-run companies that have strongcash positionsand are at thecutting edge of technology. \u201cI always say that with a little bit of a concentrated position in some great, great companies, you'll do really well in the long run,\u201d Olivier said. Firms that have delivered outsized returns over the past decade include big-tech names like Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which as of May 2025, have annualized returns of 21%, 70%, and 24%, respectively, over the past decade. You may also want to incorporate a regimented investment strategy to help reduce the overall impact ofprice volatility.Dollar-cost averaging, for example, involves investing a set amount of money on a regular schedule, no matter how the price of the investment changes. Strategies like this help investors avoid theemotional pitfallsof trying to time the market. Plus, you\u2019ll be making regular investments over time. \u201cNo matter what the markets are doing, this strategy helps you stay consistent,\u201d Olivier said. \u201cAnd if you stay consistent, you\u2019ll do really well over time.\u201d What aboutbear marketsand periods of intense volatility? Olivier\u2019s advice is simple. \u201cIt\u2019s theWarren Buffettway of investing: Know your positions, and stick to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen everybody else is running for the hills, he\u2019s holding\u2014or even buying.\" Investing $20,000 wisely involvesbalancing risk, staying disciplined, and focusing on long-term growth. Diversified strategies like index funds and regular investing can help youbuild wealth steadily over time. To put it in Buffett\u2019s words, \"Just keep buying,\" the legendary investor said in 2023 about investing in S&P 500 index funds and weathering tough times. \"American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.\"",

        "content": "It's springtime, which means the birds are chirping, flowers are blooming, and Silicon Valley is kicking off its big conference season. Things get started in earnest next week when Google (GOOG,GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) host their annual I/O and Build developer events. Chip giants AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and Qualcomm (QCOM), meanwhile, will head to Taipei, Taiwan, to participate in the Computex Taipei tech expo. In June, Apple will hold its WWDC 2025 conference, providing the world with a deeper look into the company's AI plans. The events, however, come as the tech industry continues to wrestle with issues ranging from the impact of President Trump's tariffs to AI growth fears to concerns about chip export restrictions. It will make for an interesting couple of shows as each company works to quell investor anxiety and provide a positive outlook for their future products and services. Microsoft begins itsBuild conference May 19with a keynote by CEO Satya Nadella and CTO Kevin Scott. Expect the company to provide plenty of updates on its Copilot AI software for both the enterprise and consumer markets. Investors will look for AI improvements for Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, as well as how it plans to further integrate Copilot into its Microsoft 365 productivity suite. During its most recent quarter, Microsoft said AI accounted for 16 percentage points of growth for Azure, better than the 15.6 points analysts were anticipating. Investors have raised concerns, however, about the Windows maker's decision to pull back on some of its data center lease plans, driving fears that Microsoft believes it's overinvesting in AI. Nadella shot down those worries during Microsoft's third quarter earnings call, saying the company regularly makes changes to its data center plans and that investors are only noticing those moves because they began paying more attention to them recently as they track AI growth. CFO Amy Hood also pointed out that Microsoft expects to remain resource-constrained into the June quarter as it works to build out enough AI capacity for its customers. On the consumer side, Microsoft will likely provide updates for its Copilot+ PCs \u2014 Windows 11-based PCs with AI capabilities. The company is coming up on the end of support for Windows 10 PCs, which it will almost certainly hit on during its show. Google CEO Sundar Pichai will deliver his own keynote address at hiscompany's I/O developer conference on May 20. Like Microsoft, Google is expected to provide developers with updates to its Gemini AI models and how the company is integrating them into its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and enterprise services. The GCP segment brought in $12.2 billionin the company's latest quarter,up from $9.5 billion in the same quarter last year. Google's cloud segment growth is especially important given that both its search and advertising empires are under threat from antitrust lawsuits that could force the company to dismantle the businesses. Google will show off new Android features, some of which it debuted during a special online presentation on Tuesday, and will likely dive into some of its Android XR mixed reality software. The company is currently working on an AR/VR headset with Samsung that is expected to launch later this year. Google could also reveal more about the augmented reality glasses technology it showed off at I/O last year. The company is in a three-way race to catch what the industry believes will be the next major computing platform after the smartphone. Rival Meta (META) already offers its own AI-powered smartglasses, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, complete with an AI voice assistant, and is working on future augmented reality eyewear under its Reality Labs segment. Apple is reportedly working on its own AI-powered glasses,according to Bloomberg, adding ever more pressure to Google to prove it's on track to release its own competing device. AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm will all be in attendance at Computex Taipei. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon will give separate keynotes during the event, which runs from May 19 through May 23. Look for AMD and Nvidia to provide more details about their AI offerings while Intel focuses on providing further proof of its turnaround under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan and Qualcomm demonstrates its deeper push into the PC market. Nvidia and AMD received a much-hoped-for reprieve on Tuesday as the Trump administration moved to curtail the Biden administration's so-called AI diffusion rules that would have limited the number of chips companies could ship to certain foreign countries. The chip firms announced deals with Saudi Arabia's Humain AI startup on Tuesday, further expanding their reach. Investors, however, are also wary of future tariffs on AI chips as the Trump administration continues its Section 232 investigation into whether it should place additional duties on the technology, which could impact the prices of electronics ranging from smartphones to refrigerators. We'll find out more about that in the coming weeks. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at@DanielHowley.

        "content": "Chip stocks rallied on Wednesday after a wave of artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013relatedannouncements tied to Saudi Arabia. Patrick Moorhead, founder, CEO, and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, joins Market Domination to explain what's real and what's speculative in deals from Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Patrick, it is great to see you as always. Particularly today, Patrick, because you are the man to answer this question. I was just talking to Maddie, these moves we're seeing these chip names, Patrick. And of course we had President Trump in Saudi Arabia, we had this flurry of headlines, reports, AI specific announcements, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm. You did, Patrick, on X. You asked an interesting question, I thought, Patrick, of all those announcements. You asked, listen, are these are these hard deals? Are these hard contracts or more like kind of, you know, soft LOIs, letters of intent. What's what's your line of sight there, Patrick? Yeah. So, first of all, the only thing, the only similarity between these AI deals is that they're they were with humane and and the KSA, right? But they were very different, right? AMD was all about a joint venture with a $10 billion price tag, but no details on who's funding what, where would the AMD capitalization come from. So, uh, you know, and when the details aren't there, you have to assess that this thing is early in. And then with Nvidia, it was really straightforward, right? They're selling GPUs with a price tag estimated at around $7 billion. But still no firm commitment, no firm order around that. But with that said, it's very exciting because I don't think investors were factoring any of this into their thesis going into this. You know, Patrick, one question for chip investors of course has been whether we kind of hit this peak in capex, right? And and my question to you is, was that question in any way answered by what we just saw in Saudi Arabia? And here's how Bernstein, Stacy Rasgon, you know Stacy, he's what he wrote his clients. He said for investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. Your response to that, Patrick. Uh, I agree with Stacy, and I view this as incremental upside, right? This wasn't factored into, uh, into my calculations in terms of this capex. It was typically we just look at the mag 7 and what they committed to. Uh, this was very much not in the mag 7 capital expenditure updates and it's it's an upside. One interesting thing, though, about this is that that we're researching right now is, is this potentially going to take away any business out of Western Europe that has put up nearly every blockade to drive innovation, AI, and it's not that, uh, protecting people's information is important, it is, but when they find themselves drastically behind other parts of the world, this could be a move for the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, and Cutter to take market share away from Western Europe.",

        "content": "At least one official at the Federal Reserve is still skeptical about the trajectory of inflation and the economy, despite developments this week that cheered investors.Philip Jefferson, vice chair of the central bank, said there was equal risk thatPresident Donald Trump's tariffscould push up inflation and hurt the job market, speaking at a conference in New York Wednesday.With those two dangers in mind, he said, the Fed should wait and see what happens with the economy before making any changes to its monetary policy, such as cutting borrowing costs.\"If the increases in tariffs announced so far are sustained, they are likely to interrupt progress on disinflation and generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" Jefferson said. \"Whether tariffs create persistent upward pressure on inflation will depend on how trade policy is implemented, the pass-through to consumer prices, the reaction of supply chains, and the performance of the economy.\"Jefferson's remarks came on the heels of developments in the economy and Trump's trade war, which encouraged financial markets andsent stocks soaring.On Monday, U.S. and Chinese officials said the two nations woulddrop some of the import taxesthey'd imposed on one another over the last few months. And on Tuesday, an official report on inflation showedconsumer prices rose less than expectedin April. In the early days of Trump's tariff campaign, surveys of individuals and businesses have flashed warning signs of job losses and higher prices ahead. However,hard dataon unemployment and prices show few, if any, signs of distress.The Federal Reserve's stance lately has been one of patience. The Fed is tasked with the \"dual mandate\" of keeping inflation and joblessness under control. The central bank's policy-setting committee uses its main tool, the influentialfed funds rate, to try to keep both of those metrics stable. Late last year, the Fed steadily cut rates from a 20-year high. The Fed has kept rates flat out of concern that Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation,much to the president's ire.At the same time, business leaders and economists have warned tariffs could cause an economic slowdown and job losses, which the Fed could address by cutting its benchmark interest rate. A lower fed funds rate could make all kinds of loans cheaper, boosting the economy and hiring, though at the risk of stoking inflation.The latest inflation data haven't been enough to completely quell those fears of price increases, at least not for Jefferson, one of 12 officials who vote on interest rate moves.\"With the increased risks to both sides of our mandate, I believe that the current stance of monetary policy is well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments,\" Jefferson said.",

Semiconductor stocksNvidiaand AMD rose on the day. Meanwhile, theNasdaqsaw the successful debut of the Israeli fintech company eToro\u2014a promising sign for the otherwise stagnant IPO market. Markets didn\u2019t change much on Wednesday, ending the day roughly where they started. The S&P 500 was practically flat rising less than 0.1%, theDowfinished the day down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq was up 0.5% by market close. The day\u2019s trading session did see several peaks and troughs in the various indices. At one point mid-afternoon the S&P 500 fell by 0.4% from Wednesday\u2019 s open, before recovering. The Dow was by about 200 points. And the Nasdaq oscillated throughout the day but spent most of the session above the open. The relatively calm trading day came after the U.S. and China agreed to lower their mutual tariff rates for the next 90-days. That pause gave investors hope the two superpowers would ultimately find an agreement that could restore global trade to some semblance of normalcy. At the very least, they hope that some future accord would provide some long-term clarity about what would or wouldn\u2019t happen in the world economy. The truce between the U.S. and China soothed investor\u2019s worst fears that a recession is imminent. \u201cThe de-escalation of tensions with China presents modest upside risks to our growth forecast, but more importantly, meaningfully reduces risks of recession and a sharper deterioration in the labor market,\u201dDeutsche Bankeconomists in an analyst note published Wednesday. U.S. equities all popped at the start of the week after the pause between the U.S.and China was announced late Sunday. Significantly, this week\u2019s performance has tipped the S&P 500 into positive territory for the year with a 0.4% return since January 1. The Dow and the Nasdaq both remain down about 0.8% and 0.9% for the year respectively. A couple individual semiconductor stocks in Nvidia and AMD rose throughout the day on the back of their own favorable geopolitical news. Nvidia and AMD both announceddealswith the Saudi Arabian AI company Humain during President Donald Trump\u2019s state visit across the gulf. Humain reached adeal with Nvidiathat will see it purchase 18,000 of its state-of-the-art Blackwell chips. At the same time AMD, which designs chips, announced a$10 billion partnershipwith Humain. Both stocks rose 4% on the day. Wednesday also saw themarket debutof the Israeli trading app eToro, which had a stellar first day on the Nasdaq. Shares of the company shot up more than 40%. eToro\u2019s introduction to the public markets was somewhat closely watched by investors as a sign of what might be in store for the IPO market this year. The IPO market has been quiet since 2021, a phenomenon that was not helped by this spring\u2019s market tumult. This story was originally featured onFortune.com",

        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa and Zaheer Kachwala (Reuters) -CoreWeave is looking to spend $20 billion to $23 billion this year on AI infrastructure and data center capacity, the Nvidia-backed company said on Wednesday, as it aims to meet booming demand from clients, including Microsoft. The heavy-spending plan weighed on its shares, which fell 5% after surging as much as 11% on better-than-expected revenue in its first results as a public company after debuting on the Nasdaq in March. CoreWeave has a unique way of structuring its debt and capital spending that will take time for the market to understand, CEO Mike Intrator told Reuters in an interview. \"You pay back your infrastructure fully loaded and you have significant profit,\" Intrator said. The company's projected capital expenditure of between $3 billion and $3.5 billion for the second quarter was way above its revenue expectation of $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion. The demand for data centers and high-powered servers have surged as businesses are locked in a race to develop more sophisticated generative AI technology. In the wake of U.S.-China trade tensions, Itrator said CoreWeave was working to diversify its supply chains with the aim of minimizing the impact of tariffs. \"(Our clients) are looking for really significant investment from us, and we're trying to make sure that we're doing it in a way that doesn't in any way impact our ability to secure the margins that we need in order to run our business,\" he said. Despite its strong market position, CoreWeave's main business is highly capital intensive that requires heavy upfront investments into advanced processors and systems. \"While the revenue from Microsoft is likely secure for the next three years, CoreWeave represents overflow capacity for Microsoft, which may not need that capacity in the future,\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said. The company's revenue backlog was $25.9 billion as of March 31, with its five-year deal with OpenAI adding $11.2 billion to the pile up. As part of the deal signed in March, CoreWeave will provide AI infrastructure to OpenAI, while the ChatGPT maker will get a stake. CoreWeave expects annual revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, above analysts' expectation of $4.61 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. It reported revenue of $981.6 million for the first quarter, beating the estimate of $852.9 million. (Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa and Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru and additional reporting by Max A.

        "content": "By Karen Freifeld, Hadeel Al Sayegh NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) -The U.S. has a preliminary agreement with the United Arab Emirates to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips per year, starting in 2025, two sources familiar with the situation said, boosting the Emirates' construction of data centers vital to developing artificial intelligence models. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agreement was at least through 2027, but that there was a chance it could be in place until 2030. The draft deal called for 20% of the chips, or 100,000 of them per year, to go to UAE's tech firm G42, while the rest would be split among U.S. companies with massive AI operations like Microsoft and Oracle that might also seek to build data centers in the UAE, the sources said. They said the agreement is still being negotiated and could change before being finalized. One source said the deal, elements of which were first reported by the New York Times, faced growing opposition in the U.S. government over the past day. The Biden administration issued restrictions on AI chip exports to control the flow of the sophisticated processors worldwide, in part to keep the prized semiconductors from being diverted to China, where they could bolster Beijing's military. U.S. President Donald Trump this week is on a tour of the Gulf region and on Tuesday announced $600 billion worth of commitments from Saudi Arabia, including deals to buy large quantities of chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm. Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration. The chips in the UAE deal that would go to G42 would represent a tripling or quadrupling, in terms of compute power, that would have been available to the UAE under rules put in place by the administration of former President Joe Biden. The Trump administration said last week it planned to rescind that regulation. At present, the vast majority of AI computing power is deployed in the United States and China. If all the proposed deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power center in global AI competition. The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, did not have a comment. The White House, G42 and the United Arab Emirates did not have an immediate comment. Nvidia declined to comment. Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, the UAE's ruling family and U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42. The tech holding group's chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE national security adviser and brother of the Emirates' president. The preliminary agreement also aims to promote data centers in the U.S. It currently says that for every facility G42 builds in the UAE, it must build a similar one in the U.S., the sources said. One of the sources said the definition of what is an advanced AI chip would be figured out in a separate working group that will be created later, along with security requirements. The proposed numbers of chips are for the most advanced graphics processing units, one of the sources said. As of now, that could refer to Nvidia Blackwell chips, which are more powerful than the previous generation of Hopper chips, or Nvidia's forthcoming Rubin chips, which are more powerful than both of their predecessors.

Deals have been in focus this week as President Donald Trump embarked on a four-daytour of the Middle East, with Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares gaining ground after both Supermicro collaborators announced agreements with Saudi firms. Shares of Enphase Energy (ENPH) jumped 5.8% as the energy technology company launched its new plug-and-play solar battery system in Belgium. The new product is designed to allow residents of apartments and homeowners with limited roof space to generate renewable energy from balconies, patios, or other small outdoor areas. The product introduction marks an expansion of Enphase's footprint in the European market. International Paper (IP) stock advanced 4.8% following an announcement that containerboard producer Georgia-Pacific will shutter its mill in Cedar Springs, Ga. The move will result in a reduction in containerboard capacity in the U.S., and Truist analysts suggested that the shifting supply dynamics could yield pricing power for remaining producers of the packaging material. Shares of industry peers Packaging Corp. of America (PKG) and Smurfit Westrock (SW) also moved higher. Bio-Techne (TECH) shares slipped 7.3%, the most of any stock in the S&P 500, after a presentation by the biotech firm at the BofA Securities 2025 Healthcare Conference. The company said that issues with the timing of orders for diagnostic reagents and controls stymied growth in its Diagnostics and Special segment. Bio-Techne also discussed plans to mitigate possible tariff impacts by shifting manufacturing locations and noted its exposure to U.S. academic funding, which faces budget-related uncertainties. Fellow life sciences and diagnostics firm Revvity (RVTY) participated in the same conference, and its shares dropped 5.9%. Although the company touted strength in its diagnostics and software businesses, Revvity faces tariff-related challenges, especially pertaining to its business in China. Revvity also generates a significant portion of its revenue from government and academic sectors. Analytics, technology, and research services provider IQVIA Holdings (IQV) also lost 5.9%. In its presentation at the BofA conference, IQVIA pointed to pressure on bookings related to clients delaying purchasing decisions in the uncertain macroeconomic environment. The company also addressed pricing pressure in its functional service provider business.",

        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is advancing 3% after Bank of America increased its price target on NVDA stock to $160 from $150. Additionally, the Trump administration officially announced that it would rescind some export restrictions imposed on AI chips by the Biden administration. Schwab Network reported the news on May 14. Why Bank of America Raised Its Price Target on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The bank noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) had announced projects with HUMAIN, a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund. Bank of America estimates that the combined annual value of the two companies' projects with Humain will be $3 billion to $5 billion. Additionally, by providing AI chips for foreign countries, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) can circumvent power shortfalls in the U.S. and compensate for restrictions on its shipment of such chips to China, the bank asserted. Speaking of governmental restrictions on exporting AI chips, the Trump administration disclosed that it would rescind a rule issued by the Biden administration which curbed the export of AI chips to many countries. The Trump administration had previously indicated that it would terminate the rule, but the official announcement was made today. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "content": "Foxconnposted a sharp increasein earnings for the first quarter of 2025, but cut its full-year guidance Tuesday, citing currency headwinds and U.S. trade policy risks. Revenue climbed 24.2% year over year in the JanuaryMarch quarter, supported by strong sales of AI servers. While Foxconn expects Q2 to deliver continued year-on-year growth in its server segment, Chairman Young Liu said the company was now taking a more cautious view on full-year growth compared to March. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The change in guidance reflects the recent appreciation of the Taiwan dollar, which Liu said may affect revenue performance after conversion. He also pointed to volatile U.S. tariff developments as another challenge, even as Washington and Beijing recently agreed to suspend some tariffs for 90 days. Foxconn remains a key assembler for Apple's (AAPL,Financials) iPhones and a critical partner for Nvidia (NVDA,Financials) in building AI servers, including out of a new facility in Mexico. Nvidia recently announced plans to manufacture $500 billion worth of AI servers in the U.S. over four years, in partnership with Foxconn and TSMC. Foxconn is also pursuing growth in electric vehicles. Its subsidiary, Foxtron, signed a memorandum of understanding with Mitsubishi Motors for an EV supply project. The company is in talks with Nissan on further collaboration, but no agreement has been finalized. Foxconn stock has declined 11.4% so far this year, underperforming the broader Taiwan index, which is down 5.4%. Shares rose 3.2% on Wednesday ahead of the earnings call.

        "content": "AI chip stocks are pushing the tech rally higher, much to the benefit of the Nasdaq Composite index (^IXIC). Yahoo Finance markets reporterJosh Schaferlays out several of the session's key trading themes, including the serious upside Magnificent Seven stock \u2014 comprised of tech leaders Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are seeing. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Well, the Nasdaq notches its sixth day of gains as chip stocks lead the tech rally. Yahoo finances Josh Shafer joins us now with the trading day takeaways. Josh. All right, Josh, we are going to start with the chip sector, specifically that big stock we always talk about in video, right? So more gains in the Magnificent 7 leading stocks higher today. And I want to take a look at just Nvidia's gain that we saw today for uh over 4%. And then I was zooming out, Josh, over the last six days. Look at this rise in the AI chip leader 19%. I mean, stock's been absolutely ripping. So Nvidia now, if we flip to a year to date here, as of today, it has erased all of its losses for 2025. At one point, that stock was down 30% on the year. Gives you a sense of how big this rally has been. A final point, just on the Mac 7 cohort, as a whole, if we look year to date, still not all of these stocks have recovered. And then you look at that Mac 7 index that encapsulates all of these stocks, right? So you've had recovery in the Qs, recoveries in spy, the S&P 500 ETF. Mac still down on the year though right now. For the Mac 7 names, what's the next date on the calendar I have to look for? So you have you have Nvidia earnings coming in two weeks, right? So I think that's going to be a big moment for the stock overall. And I think just looking at that earnings season and how Nvidia kind of rallies maybe into that, right? So you have this big rally going on in Nvidia, like I just pointed out. Does the stock keep moving higher into earnings because we've seen the last couple quarters, a lot gets priced into that stock, right? Nvidia comes out. I mean, they keep beating, right? They beat and raise, beat and raise, but it doesn't always necessarily help the stock. If you see a big rally going into it, I think that's going to be interesting to watch the next couple of weeks. All right. Shafer, number two. Point number two, Josh, is on the index as a whole. So right now, people are starting to talk about market valuations again, right? So when you look at the market, this is from data track research. Nichols is pointing out probably just essentially fairly valued right now on a forward 12 month P ratio. So you see the bounce that we had here, we were down here. People start to talk, oh, index is getting cheap, index is getting cheap. You're not that far from the highs that we've seen recently, right? And so now you just sort of have to think how do we get higher from here? And that becomes, I think, a little bit difficult to some extent. So, from an investor, and I'm looking at that chart, I'm thinking, okay, well, I better I'm betting that more good news better be on the way. Exactly, right? And I think so what is that good news, right? is sort of the key question here. And it's probably some solid economic data. Of course, that's still a concern, right? Is what did these tariffs before they were paused, how did they impact the economy? What do we find out over the next two months from that front? And then also, just does this administration continue to be a little bit pro market, right? I think a lot of the bulls right now in the street are pointing out when the market got shaky, felt like the administration stepped in. Do they stay kind of pro market? And as these deals get made and these negotiations go on, are there no more hiccups? And does the market feel confident? Seems to sort of be a key talking point right now. All right, final point. This is if you're looking for reasons to maybe be bullish or get a sense on sentiment, just looking at some of the stocks that are going up, Josh. You flip back a month ago and the names that we talk about that end up on maybe our trending tickers page, or I'll click on arc here, some of the names that are within that index. Look at how much some of these stocks have moved. You got a Tesla up 26%. I'm going to flip over to our AI board if I can find it here. And the AI board within that, you had Super Micro up over 15% today. You had uh Reddit was up 20 or was up 15% also at one point. Just starting to see euphoria in some of the names that are heavily shorted, and then also a little bit more risk on. And you kind of get a sense that maybe the market is getting more risk on. Is that is that would you see those kind of names having those kind of moves? That suggest to you a bit of euphoria maybe, creating? Yeah, I I think so, Josh. So let's just look year to date at a Super Micro, right? I mean, the stock was not doing great at this point. And then we'll go to where's where's my Tesla board if I can find it, Josh. Tesla is, I think, a good version of this sentiment too, right? Basically, stocks that fall more when the market's falling, right? And so where look at what happened here, right? Tesla just sort of gets whacked from the bottom. And you can sort of get a sense that people aren't really buying into some of these riskier names. As it starts to come up sharply, okay, maybe we're starting to feel risk on. And I'll highlight one more for you. The move in Palantir over the last couple weeks has been crazy, right? And I think they reported earnings recently. That was accepted well. But this isn't all earnings, right? This is a vibe in the market that we want to buy AI stocks, and what's my next AI winner? And people are looking for it in Palantir. Yeah, remember heading into that print, that stock was up about 400% over the past 12 months. It was remarkable.",

        "content": "Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares hit another record high on Wednesday, as a cooling of global trade tensions has restored risk appetite and investor enthusiasm for AI stocks. The latest surge in the company's stock comes after theU.S. and China agreed Monday to slash their tariffs on one another for 90 days, with sentiment also receiving a boost earlier this week after Bank of America analysts called the AI analytics software provider a \u201cmarket definer\u201d for companies seeking to leverage artificial intelligence. Palantir shares rose 1.6% on Wednesday to around $130, marking the second consecutive day that the AI favorite has hit all-time intraday and closing highs. The stock had fallen 6% last week as the company\u2019shigher-than-estimated earnings and outlook failed to meet investors\u2019 lofty expectations. However, the stock has nearly doubled from last month\u2019s low amid a rebound in the AI trade and expectations that the firm\u2019s software could benefit from ongoing efforts to improve government efficiency. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Palantir\u2019s chart and identify major price levels that investors may be watching. After forming apiercing patternearly last month, Palantir shares have staged a sharp rally, climbing above the prominent Februarypeakin the process. More recently, the priceconsolidatedwithin apennantbefore breaking out in Tuesday\u2019s trading session, indicating a continuation of the stock\u2019s longer-termuptrend.

To forecast where the stock\u2019s price may be headed next, investors can use bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes priortrendsto predict future price movements. When applying the analysis to Palantir\u2019s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock\u2019s trending move that immediately preceded the pennant and reposition them from the pattern\u2019sbreakoutpoint. This projects anupsidetarget of around $210 and indicates the move may play out until early to mid-June if the current trend higher replicates the prior trend analyzed. During retracements, investors should pay close pay attention to the $97 level, currently situated just above the50-day moving average (MA). The shares may encounter support in this area near the March peak, which closely aligns with brief period on consolidation that formed on the chart in mid-April. Finally, selling below this major level could see Palantir shares test lower support around $66.
