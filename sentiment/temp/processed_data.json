        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA2.33%)stock has slipped in recent times along with many other stocks --especially technology players-- as investors worried about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports. Though electronics products are exempt for the moment, the president has said he will soon announce a specific level of tariffs for the tech industry. So, tariffs do remain a risk for U.S. companies, though this doesn't change the long-term growth story for many well-established players -- such as Nvidia. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom continues, with companies continuing major investments to build out infrastructure, and as the chip leader, Nvidia stands to benefit. That's why analysts overwhelmingly rate Nvidia a buy and the average forecast calls for Nvidia stock to climb almost 50% over the coming 12 months. Yet, this week, Seaport Global Securities stepped away from the crowd by initiating coverage of Nvidia with a sell rating and predicting the stock will fall slightly from its current level. Does Seaport know something the rest of Wall Street doesn't? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. First, a quick summary of the Nvidia story. This tech giant has built dominance in the area of AI chips, designing the world's most powerfulgraphics processing units(GPUs) to power crucial AI tasks. Such tasks include training and inferencing, the procedures that givelarge language modelsthe capabilities to solve complex problems. Nvidia also has built a full portfolio of related products and services to accompany customers on their complete AI journey. So, Nvidia can help a customer build an AI platform and make use of it. All of this has helped the tech powerhouse to generate double- and triple-digit revenue growth in recent years, reaching a record level of annual revenue -- $130 billion -- last year. And this is at a high level of profitability on sales as Nvidia has maintained gross margin higher than 70%. Meanwhile, the current concerns about tariff impact across U.S. companies and industries has left Nvidia stock trading close to its lowest level in relation toforward earnings estimatesin about a year. The stock today has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24. On top of this, forecasts for a $2 trillion AI market by the early 2030s along with companies such asAlphabetsaying they plan on investing billions to support AI development suggest this growth story is set to continue. So, it's not surprising Wall Street is optimistic about Nvidia's future and encourages investors to get in on the shares. Now, let's consider Seaport's view. The firm set a $100 price target for the stock, implying a 7% decline from the April 30 closing price, and said Nvidia's AI prospects are priced in at the current level. The firm cited the complexity of deploying Nvidia's systems, customers' moves to develop their own chips, and the idea that customers may look closely at their AI spending in relation to potential use cases for the technology. Seaport doesn't see a bubble scenario here but does predict a slowdown in customers' AI budget growth. So now let's get back to our question: Does Seaport know something the rest of Wall Street doesn't, and if so, could Nvidia be heading for declines? Seaport makes valid points, but Nvidia has indicated that it's in the AI business for the long haul. In fact, when speaking about the U.S. and China's work in AI at a tech conference this week, according to CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, \"Remember this is a long-term, infinite race.\" It's very difficult to predict short-term trends during this long race. Nvidia could face hurdles at certain moments as it rolls out complex products, though its recent Blackwell launch so far has been successful. And Nvidia customers are developing their own chips but have spoken of the importance of ongoing work with Nvidia products too. All of this means that, though it's possible Seaport is right about Nvidia's performance in the months to come, this doesn't necessarily change the long-term picture. And that's why, regardless of short-term movements, it's still a great idea to buy Nvidia now and hold on to this winning AI stock as the AI growth story enters its next chapters.",

        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is slated to report quarterly results after the closing bell Tuesday, and several analysts have lowered their price targets in recent weeks in the wake oftighter restrictionson U.S. chip exports to China. Bank of America Securities recently dropped price target to $105 from $110, calling the new licensing requirements from the Trump administration an \u201ceffective shipment ban\u201d on AMD\u2019s MI308 chips.AMD warned last month that the move could result in charges of$800 millionif it isn't able to secure a license. Competitor Nvidia (NVDA) has meanwhile said it faces a potential $5.5 billion charge related to its H20 chip. Deutsche Bank analysts in late April cut their AMD price target to $105 from $120, while Wedbush Securities around the same time moved to $115 from $150. The consensus price target of analysts following AMD who are tracked by Visible Alpha is $123.50, a 25% premium over Friday\u2019s closing price of $98.80. Out of 12 tracked analysts, six rate the stock a \u201cbuy,\u201d compared with five \u201chold\u201d ratings and one \u201csell.\u201d AMD stock has lost nearly a fifth of its value in 2025. Despite the uncertain tariff environment, Citi analysts wrote Thursday, \"it appears that spending for AI continues to be unabated.\"Meta Platforms (META) this week said it plans to raise its capital expenditures this year to$64 billion to $72 billionto build AI infrastructure, while Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reiterated AI spending targets of$80 billionand$75 billion, respectively. \"AI infrastructure buildouts remain as key priorities for hyperscalers with the companies\u2019 willingness to absorb the costs of tariffs,\" Citi said. \"We view this as positive for AI-exposed stocks,\" including AMD, they wrote. Analysts expectAMD to report first-quarter revenue of $7.13 billion, up 30% year-over-year, alongside adjusted earnings of $1.55 billion, or 94 cents per share, more than 50% higher than the year-ago quarter.

        "content": "American consumers are feelingstressed and stretched. They\u2019re finding some retail relief just a few feet from the fuel pump. Convenience stores like Circle K were among just a handful of retailers that had more customers coming into their stores year-over-year in March, according to Kantar Retail\u2019s monthly shopper tracking survey. Placer.ai, which uses mobile-device location data to track foot traffic, said in December that \u201cC-store\u201d chains like Kwik Trip and Buc-ee\u2019s saw year-over-year growth in the number of shoppers coming to their stores in 2024. That has happened, retail experts say, as convenience chains have sought to improve their food and beverage offerings while keeping prices affordable. \u201cAs consumers start to look for value, we're a great trade-down opportunity from a price perspective, but not a trade-down in quality,\u201d said Darren Rebelez, CEO of Casey\u2019s General Stores (CASY), during a mid-March conference call.

Some 80% of the items bought at gas station stores are consumed within the hour, according to NACS, but many shoppers both fill up the tank and stock up on pantry items, like bread or eggs, for their next meal. Dollar sales of tobacco products, the largest convenience-store category according to market research firm NIQ, fell last year, while frozen food, wine, and deli and dairy products all rose. Younger shoppers and those with children are particularly drawn to the stores\u2019 combination of selection and convenience, according to Julie Craig, Kantar's vice president of shopper insights. \u201cIf we put ourselves in the mindset of younger parents not wanting to jump through hoops in a traditional grocery store\u2014parking, getting a cart, sprinting across an enormous store, waiting in a checkout line\u2014the convenience stores offer the ultimate quick trip,\u201d she said.

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Skyrocket After May 28",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA2.33%)stock has been under pressure so far this year, losing over 19% of its value as of this writing, thanks to factors outside the company's control that have dented investor confidence in the stock despite its impressive results in recent quarters. Export controls on shipments of Nvidia's chips to foreign countries, the potential fallout of the tariff-fueled trade war, and concerns that spending onartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure could slow down are all reasons this once high-flying chipmaker has been underperforming in 2025. However, recent developments suggest that it is on course to maintain its healthy pace of growth. In this article, we will take a closer look at the factors that could help Nvidia defy Wall Street's expectations and send the stock soaring when it releases its fiscal 2026 first-quarter results on May 28. The data center business produces a massive chunk of Nvidia's revenue, with the segment accounting for 88% of the company's top line in fiscal 2025 (which ended on Feb. 26). So, the health of this business plays a central role in determining Nvidia's financial performance. The good part is that the recent quarterly results from its semiconductor peers suggest that the demand for AI-focused data center chips remains strong. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM3.68%), popularly known as TSMC, released its first-quarter 2025 results in April and said that it expects revenue fromsales of AI chips to double this year. Nvidia gets its chips manufactured by TSMC, and the latter points out that it hasn't seen any change in customers' behavior despite the tariff-related uncertainty. Moreover, TSMC reiterated its 2025 capital expenditure guidance of $38 billion to $42 billion. The company points out that it will spend 70% of that budget on advanced process technologies that will help it meet the strong demand for AI chips. Also, it is expecting a slight acceleration in revenue growth in the current quarter, and that bodes well for Nvidia since it is one of the largest customers of the Taiwan-based foundry giant. And semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplierLam Researchalso delivered impressive results recently that beat expectations. The company had strong guidance that was well ahead of expectations, signaling an improvement in growth from the robust demand for AI chips. What's more, Lam is anticipating its top line to increase by around 63% over the next four years, suggesting that it expects the favorable demand to continue. The concerns about a potential drop in AI infrastructure spending may be overblown, as evident from the recent news from key cloud service providers.Alphabet, for instance, says that it became the first cloud provider to offer Nvidia's latest Blackwell processors. Moreover, the Google parent has reaffirmed its $75 billion capital expenditure forecast for 2025, which would be an increase of 43% from last year, as it looks to shore up its AI capabilities by investing in the latest hardware. Oraclehas started deploying Nvidia's Blackwell processors as well to power its cloud infrastructure and meet the growing demand for reasoning models and agentic AI applications. The company intends to build Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Superclusters that will be equipped with more than 100,000 Blackwell graphics cards. And the GPU leader is on track to win big from the $500 billion Project Stargate, led byOpenAIandSoftBank. Nvidia is expected to supply 400,000 of its AI chips for the first Stargate data center. It sells the base variant of its Blackwell B200 chip for $30,000 to $40,000 apiece, so it could witness a massive boost in its business as the Stargate Project is scaled up to its full size of 10 AI data centers. In all, it looks like the demand for Blackwell processors that Nvidia started selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, generating $11 billion in revenue, is set to move the needle in a bigger way for the company when it releases its results on May 28. Management has called for $43 billion in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, a jump of 65% from the prior year. The ramp-up in production of advanced AI chips by its foundry partner TSMC along with the deployment of the Blackwell chips by major cloud service providers suggest that it could indeed meet or even exceed its expectations. An earnings beat along with better-than-expected guidance could turn out to be the much-needed catalyst for Nvidia stock, and the company seems ready to deliver on both fronts based on the points discussed above. That's why buying thisAI stockbefore its upcoming earnings report could turn out to be a smart move considering that it trades at an attractive 25 times forward earnings right now.",

        "header": "Chip Demand Could Be Slowing, but Does That Make Nvidia Stock a Sell?",
        "content": "Is the party over forNvidia(NVDA2.33%)? The stock earned massive gains in 2023 and 2024 as its role in ChatGPT'sartificial intelligence(AI) breakthrough made it the undisputed leader in the AI accelerator industry. So successful are its products that AI accelerators now generate nearly all of the company's revenue. More recently, Nvidia pulled back from record highs following the news of the DeepSeek breakthrough earlier this year. And signs of falling demand and rising competition cast further doubts on the stock's near-term direction. Do all of these doubts make the stock a sell? Let's take a closer look. Nvidia's current state arguably makes it look like a sell in the near term. Aside from DeepSeek's breakthrough in lowering the cost of AI, new challenges are emerging. One is political, as rules imposed by the Trump administration could stop it from exporting some of its products to other countries. Another is competitive, since many of the company's largest customers have looked into designing AI chips in-house, which could bode poorly for the company. Moreover, the state of one of its more prominent customers,Super Micro Computer, cast doubt on Nvidia's near-term prospects. Supermicro, which uses Nvidia's AI accelerators in many of its servers, cut its outlook amid what it calls \"delayed customer platform decisions.\" This is a problem for Nvidia, as the data segment that designs its AI accelerators accounted for $115 billion of the company's $130 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025. The company's revenue increased 114% in the fiscal year, but its sales outlook for the first quarter of 2026 would already mean a deceleration to 65% growth, and the company may have to scale back such estimates further as customer demand falls. That might mean itsprice-to-earnings ratio(P/E) of 36 is not the bargain it appears to be. And investors could rethink the company's valuation given theprice-to-book ratioof 33, which is well above theS&P 500average of 4.8. However, despite its challenges, investors have good reason to believe the pessimism is overdone. For all of the concerns, AI demand remains high. Grand View Research estimated the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip market at 29% through 2030. So, even if industry growth faces a temporary disruption right now, it is likely to continue and possibly reaccelerate as the uncertainty recedes. Moreover, Nvidia retains its dominant market share, particularly with the most advanced AI chips. Estimates place its market share as 85%, indicating that competitors are not having much success challenging the company. Furthermore, companies that try to compete not only have to match Nvidia's Blackwell architecture but also must have an answer for its next-generation chip, Rubin, which it plans to release in 2026. Even if peers catch up to its less advanced chips, Nvidia is still likely to dominate on the leading edge. Indeed, revenue hikes will slow since triple-digit increases are not sustainable over time. Nonetheless, growth is unlikely to stop, and that means net income can still grow rapidly. As stated before, its P/E ratio is 36, and the estimatedforward P/Eof 24 indicates its profits will continue to rise. With a forward P/E so low, the continued increases should eventually take the stock higher, even if some of the worst fears about Nvidia's near-term future are realized. Given the state of Nvidia, the party is probably not over, and the stock is more likely a hold than a sell. Admittedly, investors need to brace for revenue growth to slow down rapidly. While the company and its investors have enjoyed triple-digit increases in recent quarters, it's unrealistic to expect Nvidia would ever continue that rate of growth in the long run. With more companies pausing their spending, it is unclear how rapidly that growth will decelerate. However, such concerns are unlikely to derail its growth story over the longer term. As the company leads the lucrative AI industry, Nvidia should continue to drive outsize shareholder returns over time.",

        "content": "Investors are flocking to the artificial intelligence (AI) space to find stocks capable of producing huge gains for their portfolio. Already, many companies have seen their valuations soar. But the biggest days of growth are still ahead. In 2023, the AI market was valued at just $189 billion. By 2032, this market is expected to surpass $4trillionin value. Both Nvidia(NVDA2.33%)andSuper Micro Computer Inc.(SMCI2.87%)are exposed to rising demand for AI. But only one stock should top your buy list for its long-term growth potential. Make no mistake: Both of these companies are exposed to the rising tide of AI demand. But each has a very different strategy for how they will benefit. Let's start with Super Micro Computer. In a nutshell, the company sells computer servers specially designed for running AI programs faster and more efficiently. These custom systems are basically one-stop shops, with the required graphics processing units (GPUs)and cooling systems ready to go. Nvidia, meanwhile, is a supplier to Super Micro Computer. In fact, most of the GPUs Super Micro Computer includes in its systems are Nvidia chips. Think of Super Micro Computer as a direct supplier to AI and data center companies, while Nvidia is a direct supplier to those looking to set up infrastructure to run those businesses. Thanks to the rapid growth in AI infrastructure spending, both companies are growing quickly, with more than 50% sales growth projected for both businesses this year. But if you want to figure out which business is more valuable, just look at each stock's gross margins and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Nvidia's gross margins are more than six times higher than Super Micro Computer, and its valuation is more than double on a P/E basis. So, both companies are bonafide AI businesses that are growing quickly. But only one company should top your buy list: Nvidia. As we'll see, its high margins and valuation are well deserved. NVDA Revenue Growth Estimate for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts. When it comes to investing inAI stocks, Nvidia should be at the top of your list. What Super Micro Computer does -- essentially aggregating a bunch of third-party components -- is far easier to commoditize than what Nvidia is doing. In a nutshell, it's far easier to replicate Super Micro Computer's business than Nvidia's. Nvidia's AI GPUs are the result of decades of investment, and its CUDA developer suite has proven an immense challenge to compete with, even for well-financed competitors likeIntelandAdvanced Micro Devices. Right now, Nvidia controls 70% to 95% of the AI GPU market. Super Micro Computer, meanwhile, controls just 8% of the AI server market. So not only is Nvidia's competitive position more durable, but it's also simply more dominant. All of these result in 75% gross margins, indicating far more pricing power versus Super Micro Computers. Over time, I expect Super Micro Computer's revenues to expand heavily alongside rising investment for AI infrastructure in general. But due to the commoditized nature of its business, I don't expect gross margins to expand much. Nvidia, meanwhile, can expect to maintain its industry-leading margins for years to come. And shares aren't as expensive as they appear. Yes, Nvidia stock trades at 37 times trailing earnings. But compared to forward earnings -- that is, based on what analysts expect it to earn over the next 12 months -- shares trade at just 25 times forward earnings. That's a fair price for a dominant, profitable business exposed to the biggest growth opportunity in decades.",

        "content": "May is here, and the notion of \"sell in May and go away\" seems wrong this year. The market is full of fantastic values, and depending on how tariffs shake out over the next few months, there could be a stock market resurgence, depending on what deals are announced. There are four stocks that top my best buys list, and I think each one is well-positioned to succeed over the long term, regardless of what happens over the next few months. Image source: Getty Images. It shouldn't surprise anyone that I'm includingNvidia(NVDA2.33%)on this list. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. Although investors seemed at the moment to have lost interest in this generational shift in favor of focusing on tariffs, Nvidia is still slated to see monster growth this year. Wall Street analysts project 54% revenue growth for Fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026) and 23% growth in fiscal 2027. However, it could be well above those growth numbers if the data center market grows quickly. In 2024, data center capital expenditures (capex) rose to around $400 billion, but Nvidia projects data center capex will rise to $1 trillion by 2028. Considering that Nvidia generated around $115 billion from data centers over the past 12 months, this would indicate monster growth for the company over the next few years. Despite this rosy picture, Nvidia's stock trades at just shy of25 times forwardearnings, which is near the cheapest it has been in some time. As a result, I think it's an excellent stock to scoop up in May, especially before it reports Q1 earnings later in the month. Alphabet(GOOG1.83%)(GOOGL1.69%)has already released Q1 earnings, and management was mostly upbeat about the company's prospects. While they acknowledged that tariffs will cause some headwinds, they still feel great about the general business direction and how the company is integrating various AI features. However, all of that is overshadowed by the effects a trade war could have on the company, as well as its two court cases. Both ruled that Alphabet has operated two illegal monopolies, one with its search engine and the other with its advertising business. Both of these could be long-term headwinds, but it's still a long way away from knowing the final outcome because this case will undoubtedly end up at the Supreme Court. In the meantime, Alphabet's stock is dirt cheap, trading around 16.7 times forward earnings, far cheaper than theS&P 500's 20.5 times forward earnings valuation. \u00a0Alphabet's stock is almost too cheap to ignore here, as investors have already priced in a worst-case scenario for the company. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM3.68%)is one of the hidden beneficiaries of an AI boom as it makes chips for nearly every major player in that industry. Companies like Nvidia don't have the ability to manufacture chips themselves, so they outsource that work to a foundry like TSMC. During its Q1 conference call, TSMC acknowledged that tariffs carry risks and uncertainty, but it stated it hasn't felt any impact and reaffirmed revenue guidance for 2025, which is expected to grow at a mid-20% rate. That growth is just part of a larger long-term trend, where TSMC expects to increase revenue at about a 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years.  TSM P/E Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. Despite that strong outlook, TSMC's stock trades for a mere 17.8 times forward earnings.\u00a0That's a pretty cheap price historically. Investors should use May to pick up some shares of this long-term winner. If avoiding tariffs and related factors isn't addressed in your portfolio, I suggest scooping up some shares ofMercadoLibre(MELI-0.74%). The company is the dominant e-commerce giant in Latin America and also includes a fintech wing. It's as if you combinedPayPalandAmazoninto a single business. This dominant company has consistently grown revenue and earnings over the past few years and is relatively immune to U.S. decisions because its business is focused on Latin America, despite being listed on a U.S. stock exchange.  MELI operating revenue (quarterly year-over-year growth)data byYCharts. This strong growth is expected to continue in the foreseeable future because Latin America is much further behind the e-commerce buildout than the U.S. As a result, I think it's an excellent stock to buy now as it provides a safe haven for investors to access a strong and growing company without beingaffected by tariff decisions.",

        "content": "Over the past five years,Nvidia(NVDA2.33%)stock has risen in value by nearly 1,500%, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. Think it's too late to benefit as an investor? Think again. According to the charts below, shares remain very attractive for long-term investors. On a price-to-sales basis, Nvidia shares look outrageously expensive. Shares trade at 21 times sales despite a market cap of around $3 trillion. Few companies in history this large have traded at such a high premium. But because Nvidia is a profitable business, we can also look at shares on aprice-to-earningsbasis. From this perspective, shares don't look nearly as expensive. And when it comes to shareholder returns, profits matter a lot more than sales.  NVDA Revenue Growth Estimate for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts Right now, theS&P 500as a whole trades at 28 times earnings. Nvidia stock trades at a 35% premium to the market overall -- not bad for a highly profitable business at the center of one of the biggest growth markets in history: artificial intelligence (AI). But because its sales are still growing at 50% or more per year, Nvidia stock trades at just 25 times forward earnings -- that is, based on what analysts expect the company to earn over the next 12 months. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio, meanwhile, is around 20, meaning Nvidia trades at just a 25% premium to the market on a forward basis. Image source: Getty Images. As you can see, Nvidia's fast growth should significantly reduce the stock's valuation premium over the next 12 months. And given the growth in AI demand, this premium should shrink for many years to come. Eventually, Nvidia shares could trade at adiscountto the market based on today's prices. That will require patience to play out, but one thing is clear: From an earnings perspective, Nvidia is hardly overvalued.",

        "header": "Super Micro Computer Stock Plunges. Is This a Buying Opportunity?",
        "content": "One of the most volatile stocks over the past year or so,Super Micro Computer(SMCI2.87%)continued its habit of making big moves after its shares tumbled following the company's pre-announcement of poor fiscal Q3 earnings results. The stock has lost about two-thirds of its value over the past year. The stock has been on a crazy roller-coaster ride ever since a short report came out questioning the company's accounting and accusing it of other misdeeds. The delay of its annual report, a reported investigation into the company by the Department of Justice, and the resignation of its auditor only added to the intrigue. However, the company is now current with its filings and reporting full results, but it just looks like they will be disappointing. Below, I'll take a closer look at Supermicro's announcement to see if this could be a buying opportunity in the stock. For those unfamiliar with Supermico, it's a hardware integrator that designs and assembles servers and rack solutions, which are fully configured systems that include networking, cooling, and power built in. It was one of the first companies in the space to offer direct liquid cooling (DLC) in its setups. Server hardware generates a lot of heat, especially when running artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and DLC offers some nice advantages over traditional air cooling. The company tends to build and customize its systems aroundNvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs), and it's a key original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partner of the chipmaker. As such, it has benefited nicely from theartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure buildout. However, since the company is essentially a middleman integrator, its business has lowgross margin. Despite the customization that it offers, it's in a commoditized field with low differentiation and intense competition. Meanwhile, it's passing on very expensive component costs, such as GPUs, that inflate revenue but don't add much to gross profit. While Supermicro is in a notoriously slim gross margin business, it still has seen pressure on this front. This began showing up in its fiscal Q4 ending in June 2024 when its gross margin plunged from 17% a year ago to 11.3%. At the time, the company said that it had reduced prices in the pursuit of new design wins. For fiscal Q2, its adjusted gross margin remained strained, coming in at 11.9%. For the company's most recent quarter, the gross margin problems didn't go away. In fact, they got worse. Supermicro said its gross margin would be 220 basis points lower than fiscal Q2, which would drop it to only 9.7%. This stemmed from the company taking increased inventory reserves on older-generation products and then rushing newer-generation products to customers. Supermicro added that customers were delaying platform decisions, which moved sales into its fiscal Q4. As a result, it lowered its fiscal Q3 revenue forecast from a range of $5 billion to $6 billion to a new range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. It also lowered its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) forecast, taking it from $0.46 to $0.62 to $0.29 to $0.31. A year ago, the company reported adjusted EPS of $0.66 (split adjusted) on revenue of $3.85 billion. So sales growth would be 18%, while its EPS looks poised to decline. Source: Company press release At the heart of Supermicro's problems appears to be customers transitioning to Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. Blackwell remains capacity-constrained, but it appears customers are now more willing to wait for Nvidia's newest chip architecture than buy servers powered by older Hopper chips. This could lead to Hopper inventory piling up and future discounting. This could be temporary in nature, but with Nvidia speeding up its new chip designs to about once every year, this dynamic could become a more common occurrence. Supermicro will have to learn to better manage its supply chain to more closely match inventory and demand in the future during these chip design transition periods. Image source: Getty Images With aforward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)of under 12x this fiscal year's analyst estimates, Supermicro shares aren't expensive. However, given its low gross margin and the commoditized nature of its business, the company hasn't historically commanded a large valuation multiple. Supermicro is still set up to benefit from the AI infrastructure buildout, but it's going to have to manage its current inventory and margin issues. Meanwhile, the stock is still carrying some baggage related to its short accusations and filing delay. There are a lot of AI stocks on sale, given the recent market volatility. I think there are better ways to play the AI infrastructure boom.",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence chip king,Nvidia(NVDA2.33%), has been on a long, dominant run for several years now. The company is seen as the best picks-and-shovels play in what could be a game-changing sector that impacts nearly all aspects of our daily lives. However, a tough run this year and recent export restrictions targeting China have now sprouted the first sell rating from a Wall Street analyst. Seaport Global Securities analyst Jay Goldberg recently downgraded Nvidia to a sell rating and issued a $100 price target, the lowest on Wall Street. Nvidia and the rest of the AI sector, as well as the entire stock market, certainly face a tough near-term macroeconomic outlook. Should investors be worried? Goldberg, in his research note, suggested that theupside from AIis \"priced in for now.\" Goldberg is also bearish due to his belief that the company's biggest customers \"are all looking to design their own chips,\" and \"it's likely that AI budgets slow in '26.\" The desire to have custom AI chips could be a trend, but it's more likely that AI broadens its reach to a much bigger customer base that may be looking for third-party solutions to keep up with competition instead of outright being a leader. Nvidia still makes the most advanced chips, and it doesn't look to be at any risk of losing this market-leading position. Even in China, where Huawei reportedly began testing a chip to rival Nvidia, it's only going to rival the company's H100 Hopper chip, which isn't even the company's most recent design. Image source: Nvidia. The rest of 2025 could be tough sledding for Nvidia, but the company's valuation of 26 forward times earnings estimates is quite reasonable. Its dominant position, both in market share and innovation, should help it overcome near-term hurdles, making the stock a long-term buy for any investor who believes in the AI opportunity overall.",
