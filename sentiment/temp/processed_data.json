        "content": "We recently published a list of12 AI Stocks Making Waves Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks making waves today. China\u2019s foreign ministry recently released a video on its social media feeds, complete with a voice-over in American-accented English, comparing the acceptance of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 145% tariffs to \u201cdrinking poison\u201d. \u201cChina won\u2019t kneel down, because we know standing up for ourselves keeps the possibility of cooperation alive, while compromise snuffs it out\u2026 Imperialists are always arrogant. If they show a bit of reason it\u2019s only because they are forced to do so\u201d A Chinese official revealed that Beijing believes yielding or compromising now would only weaken China in the future and that it would authorize Trump to change the terms later. These ongoing tariff riots aren\u2019t superficial, rather, they are a reflection of deeper tensions in the ongoing US-China rivalry, particularly over dominance in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. READ ALSO:12 AI Stocks Analysts Are Talking About Right Nowand10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week. In the initial days of the tariff frenzy, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland had called on President Donald Trump to take the threat of tariffs off the table. She argued that the U.S. will need Canadian energy in the race to achieve dominance in artificial intelligence. Freeland has deemed the tariffs as \u201cthe dumbest trade war in history,\u201d stating how the U.S.-Canada trade relationship is largely balanced when oil, gas, and electricity are excluded. She said that the tariff threat needs to be taken \u201cdefinitively off the table.\u201d \u201cYou are really lucky that Canada is the country that sells you oil and gas and electricity. We are a much more reliable supplier than, say, Venezuela. And the fact is, particularly with AI, America\u2019s needs for energy are only going to increase.\u201d Canada aside, the artificial intelligence boom is being slowed due to the overall global trade war triggered by the Trump administration. Upcoming earnings reports from tech giants and utilities powering the massive data centers will reveal whether tit-for-tat tariffs, particularly between the U.S. and China, are making businesses change their plans for building data centers and other infrastructure. China plays an important role in the production of AI hardware. It was excluded from a 90-day tariff reprieve earlier. According to analysts, the 145% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will sharply increase data center costs if an exemption on electronics is rolled back. \u201cMuch of the electrical infrastructure and data center equipment is manufactured outside of the U.S. In many cases this equipment is in short supply and demand is high globally. Tariffs will likely make this more challenging, especially if foreign suppliers divert this equipment to other markets.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) shares surged in extended trading Wednesday after the Windows maker issued fiscalthird-quarter results and guidance that topped Wall Street's expectations. boosted by strong growth in its cloud business. CEO Satya Nadella said the company\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, which houses its Azure cloud computing platform, continues to benefit from businesses\u2019 need to expand output, reduce costs and accelerate growth, adding that Microsoft continues to innovate across its AI stack. While Microsoft shares have risen 15% from their April low, they remain down 6% since the start of the year as of Wednesday\u2019s close. Like other big tech names, concerns about sweeping tariffs and a reduction inAI spendingcontinue to weigh on investor sentiment. Microsoft shares rose nearly 7% to around $423 in after-hours trading. Below, we take a closer look at Microsoft\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify key price levels worth watching. Following a successful retest of the top trendline of afalling wedgepattern, Microsoft shares staged a sharp move higher leading into the tech giant\u2019s earning\u2019s report, potentially setting the stage for a longer-term bullish reversal. It\u2019s also worth noting that the shares on Wednesday registered their highesttrading volumein three weeks, suggesting that larger market participants, such asinstitutional investorsand hedge funds, had positioned for a significant post-earnings move. Let\u2019s analyze Microsoft\u2019s chart to identify two key overhead areas to watch, while also pointing out crucialsupport levelsworth monitoring during future retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits at around $442. This level may provide resistance near a trendline that roughly links severalpeaksthat formed on the chart between September and January. A decisive close above this level could see Microsoft shares make a move up toward the $468 area. Investors who haveaccumulated sharesat lower price may look forprofit-takingopportunities in this location near the stock\u2019srecord highset in July last year. During future retracements in the stock, it\u2019s worth tracking the $395 level near Wednesday\u2019s closing price.

        "content": "The recent volatility in the stock market has seen many technology companies fall into value territory. For investors with a long view, this can be a great time to start accumulating shares in market-leading companies that are trading at attractive valuations. Let's look at three leading tech companies that fit this bill. Despite a bounce from its lows,Nvidia(NVDA-0.24%)is still very attractively valued, trading at aforward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)of under 25 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.5price/earnings-to-growth (PEG)ratio. Stocks with PEG ratios below 1 are typically viewed as undervalued, so by this metric, Nvidia's shares remain on the clearance rack. Admittedly, there have been some investor concerns about the stock recently. The impact of achip export banto China and tariffs on the company has been one concern, while the bigger one has been worries that data center spending is about to slow. However, commentary from the sector continues to point to strong data center growth ahead. At a recent conference,Amazonsaid that it only sees numbers going up, while on their earnings calls, both data center supplierVertivandcloud computingcompanyAlphabetechoed the strong demand and capacity constraints in the market they were seeing. That's great news for a company that has a more than 80% share in thegraphic processing unit (GPU)market, which is the main chip used to power AI workloads. Nvidia has created a wide moat with its CUDA software platform, which allows its chips to be easily programmed. It also has a collection of AI-specific libraries and tools that help improve its chips' performance running AI workloads. As long as data center spending continues to rise, Nvidia's stock should be a long-term winner. Image source: Getty Images Alphabet(GOOGL-0.75%)(GOOG-0.62%)is arguably one of the cheapest mega-cap tech stocks out there, given the collection of market-leading and emerging businesses under its umbrella. The company is the largest digital advertiser in the world, owning the world's leading search engine, Google, and the most-watched video platform, YouTube. It also owns the world's third-largest cloud computing company and the fast-growing robotaxi business,Waymo. In addition, Alphabet was one of the first companies to develop its own custom AI chips, while last year, itsWillow chipfor quantum computing helped solve a major obstacle in the field. Its newest Gemini AI model, meanwhile, has been one of the best-performing on independent AI benchmarking leaderboards. While there has been some worry about AI displacing search, there have been no signs of this impacting Alphabet's search business, with revenue rising 10% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, its AI Overviews have been improving and seeing a strong reception, with it attracting 1.5 billion AI Overview users a month. The company noted that it continues to monetize its AI Overviews at a similar rate to search. Given its much higher costs, AI is likely to become complementary to search and take on a different monetization model than the ad-dominated search model. As such, free search will likely continue to play a big role in the future for both users and advertisers. With a forward P/E of 17 times, Alphabet stock is too cheap. Google Cloud and Waymo will continue to be strong growth drivers, while Google search and YouTube should continue to be nice, steady-growing businesses. Another leading tech stock in the bargain bin isTaiwan SemiconductorManufacturing(TSM1.45%), or TSMC for short, which trades at a forward P/E of 17.7 times and a PEG just above 0.5. The company is the leading semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world, where it produces advanced chips for customers like Nvidia. While rival foundries have struggled, TSMC has managed to become an invaluable partner to leading chip designers through its technological expertise and scale. This has allowed the company to benefit not only from increasing chip demand but also to gain strong pricing power. TSCM's strong growth could be seen in its Q1 numbers, with revenue climbing 35% to $25.5 billion, while its gross margin expanded 190 basis points year over year, and its earnings per American depositary receipt (ADR) soared 54%. As long as the AI infrastructure buildout continues, TSMC remains in a strong position. The company works closely with its top customers to increase capacity to meet their growing demands. It's building manufacturing facilities around the globe, including in the U.S., and continues to be poised to be the leader in the space. With a combination of increasing demand for its services and strong pricing power, TSMC is set to be a long-term winner.",

        "content": "Semiconductors are the beating heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Graphics processing units (GPUs), AI accelerators, high-bandwidth memory, and networking equipment fill modern data centers, delivering the computing capacity developers need to create advanced AI software. Data center spending is growing each year, andNvidia(NVDA-0.24%)CEO Jensen Huang predicts it will top $1 trillion annually by 2028 as tech giants and start-ups alike battle for AI supremacy. TheiShares Semiconductor ETF(SOXX0.96%)holds 30 different stocks that could be massive winners if Huang is right. It's currently down 16% in 2025 amid the broader market sell off that was triggered by simmering global trade tensions, but here's why investors might want to look past the short-term noise and buy it now. Image source: Getty Images. The iShares SemiconductorETFwas established in 2001, so it has helped investors navigate numerous hardware booms driven by technologies like the internet, the smartphone, enterprise software, andcloud computing. Most suppliers of chips and components are now focusing on AI, because that's where the demand has shifted. The top five holdings in the iShares ETF feature some of the biggest hardware names in theAIspace, and they represent 37.9% of the total value of the portfolio: Stock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting 1.Broadcom 8.69% 2. Nvidia 8.01% 3.Texas Instruments 7.49% 4.Advanced Micro Devices 6.97% 5.Qualcomm 6.81% Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 25, 2025, and are subject to change. Broadcommakes AI accelerators for three unnamed hyperscale customers which can be customized to suit their needs, so they are a great alternative to traditionalGPUsfrom suppliers like Nvidia. Broadcom thinks it could capture up to $90 billion in annual revenue from those three customers alone by fiscal 2027. Beyond chips, the company sells data center switches and networking equipment to facilitate rapid processing speeds, which is also critical for AI developers. Despite growing competitive threats, Nvidia's data center GPUs are still the benchmark in AI hardware. The company recently unveiled its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU, which delivers a50-foldperformance bump in certain configurations compared to its old Hopper-based H100. The Blackwell Ultra architecture was designed for \"reasoning\" AI models, whichrequire up to 100 times more computing powerthan traditionallarge language models, according to Jensen Huang. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is an emerging powerhouse in the data center space. It has its own lineup of AI GPUs, and itslatest MI355Xis built on a new architecture called CDNA (Compute DNA) 4, which was designed to rival Nvidia's original Blackwell architecture. However, those chips won't ship to customers in high volumes until midyear, so Nvidia still has a significant first-mover advantage. But it's not all about the data center, because AMD is also a top supplier of AI chips for personal computers, which could be a big growth market in the future. Outside of the above stocks, the iShares ETF holds a number of other prominent AI hardware names. They includeMicron Technology, which supplies memory and storage chips, andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which fabricates most of the GPUs designed by Nvidia and AMD. President Donald Trump imposed a broad 10%tariffon all imported goods from America's trading partners in early April, in addition to a series of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" on specific countries. However, semiconductors are exempt from the reciprocal levies, mainly because leading the AI race is a matter of national security for the U.S. Nevertheless, trade tensions coulddrive an economic slowdown, which might affect demand for chips in the short term as data center operators reevaluate their budgets.  Data byYCharts. But here's the good news: The iShares Semiconductor ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 10.4% since it was established in 2001, beating the average annual gain of 7.8% in theS&P 500over the same period. Plus, the ETF has delivered an accelerated annual return of 20.9% over the last 10 years specifically, thanks to the broad adoption of technologies like enterprise software, cloud computing, and now AI. The point is the iShares ETF has weathered a number of economic shocks during its 24-year history -- including President Trump's last tariff saga in 2018 -- while still delivering strong returns. If data center spending does grow to an annual rate of $1 trillion by 2028 as Jensen Huang predicts, then those returns are likely to continue (if not accelerate further). As a result, this might be a great time to buy the iShares ETF, especially considering its year-to-date dip of 16%.",

        "header": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: SoundHound AI vs. Palantir",
        "content": "SoundHound AI(SOUN-1.90%)andPalantir Technologies(PLTR2.15%)are both well-positioned to profit from the rapid growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. SoundHound develops AI-powered speech and audio recognition tools, while Palantir's AI-driven data mining services help government agencies and large companies make faster and smarter decisions. SoundHound went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on April 28, 2022, and the combined company's stock started trading at $8.72 per share. Palantir went public via a direct listing on Sept. 30, 2020, and its stock opened at $10. SoundHound's stock now trades just below $10, but Palantir's stock has surged to nearly $115. Let's see why Palantir outperformed SoundHound AI by such a wide margin -- and if it's still the betterAI playright now. Image source: Getty Images. SoundHound's namesake app can identify a song by hearing a recorded clip or a few hummed bars. But its core growth engine is actually Houndify, its development platform for custom AI-powered voice, audio, and conversational applications. That's an appealing choice for companies that don't want to share their data with a tech giant likeAlphabet's Google orMicrosoft. Its customers include automakers likeHyundai, smart TV makers likeWalmart's Vizio, and fast food chains like Church's Chicken.Nvidiaalso uses Houndify in its Drive operating system for connected vehicles. SoundHound's revenue rose 47% in 2022, 47% in 2023, and 85% in 2024. That recent acceleration was partly driven by its acquisitions of the restaurant AI company Synq3, the online food ordering platform Allset, and the conversational AI company Amelia. It also partnered with the chatbot maker Perplexity to upgrade its own large language models (LLMs). Analysts expect SoundHound's revenue to surge 96% to $166 million as it narrows its net loss from $351 million to $97 million. That outlookseems bright, but a few issues are likely preventing its stock from taking off. With a market cap of $3.9 billion, SoundHound still looks expensive at 23 times this year's sales. It's also expected to stay unprofitable for the foreseeable future, and it even postponed its 10-K filing by 10 days in March to deal with the \"complexity\" of its acquisitions of Synq3 and Amelia. To make matters worse, Nvidia -- which once owned a minor stake in SoundHound -- liquidated its entire stake earlier this year. As it faces those issues in this wobbly and unpredictable market, it could struggle to justify its high valuations. Palantir operates two main platforms: Gotham for its government clients and Foundry for its commercial clients. Gotham serves most of America's government agencies and military branches, while Foundry serves big companies likeMorgan StanleyandAirbus. Both platforms provide integrated AI tools for building custom AI applications. Palantir's revenue rose 24% in 2022 and 17% in 2023. Its growth decelerated as the macro headwinds drove its commercial customers to rein in their spending, and it struggled with the uneven timing of its new U.S. government contracts. However, it turned profitable in 2023 as it reined in its spending and reduced its stock-based compensation expenses. In 2024, Palantir's revenue increased 29% as its EPS more than doubled. That acceleration was fueled by the rapid growth of its U.S. commercial business, which bounced back as interest rates declined; geopolitical conflicts, which fed new government contracts; and the increased adoption of its AI tools to craft customized AI applications. Its growing market cap and stable profits led to its addition to both theS&P 500andNasdaq-100in the fourth quarter of 2024. In 2025, analysts expect Palantir's revenue and EPS to soar 31% and 35%, respectively, as its core markets keep growing. That outlook is rosy, but it'sgetting overvalued. At $115 per share with a market cap of $270.5 billion, Palantir trades at 213 times its forward adjusted earnings and 72 times this year's sales. In other words, any bad news -- including reductions to government spending and tariff-induced headwinds for its top commercial clients -- could pop those bubbly valuations. I wouldn't rush to buy either of these stocks right now. SoundHound is still expanding, but its growing dependence on acquisitions and its lack of profits indicate its business isn't sustainable yet. Palantir's business looks a lot healthier, but it's trading atmeme stockvaluations. But if I had to pick one over the other, I'd stick with Palantir. I wouldn't go all-in on its stock at these prices, but I'd be willing todollar-cost averageinto the stock over the next few quarters or years to smooth out its volatile swings. I'm not as confident in SoundHound's long-term growth potential yet.",

        "header": "Down Nearly 20%, This AI Giant Is the Best Bargain \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Right Now",
        "content": "Stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" led market gains last year as investors bet on a potential artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. This group of top tech stocks has been investing heavily in AI, and each member is well positioned to benefit from the AI growth story. I'm talking aboutApple,Alphabet,Amazon,Meta Platforms,Microsoft,Nvidia(NVDA-0.24%), andTesla. But in recent times, these once sought-after stocks have been much less popular with investors. As President Trump announced plans to tax imports, investors worried the tariffs, resulting in higher costs, could hurt both the U.S. consumer and U.S. companies. TheS&P 500index fell as much as 15% from the start of the year through its lowest point last month. Stocks across industries have suffered, but companies that rely heavily on production abroad took the biggest hit. And tech stocks are at the top of the list. Though Trump temporarily exempted electronics from tariffs, investors worry that an eventual duty -- regardless of the level -- will represent a headwind. And that's weighed on shares of one of last year's biggest AI winners. This company has seen its stock drop nearly 20% since the start of the year -- and valuation has followed. It's not the very cheapest of the Magnificent Seven, but it actually represents the best bargain right now. Let's find out why. Image source: Getty Images. You may be surprised when I tell you that this stock is the once high-flying Nvidia. It's hard to imagine the stock as a bargain after its 800% gain over the past two years. Why has Nvidia climbed? The company quickly emerged as the biggest potential winner of the AI race, and this is thanks to its leading portfolio of AI products and services. Nvidia makes the world's most powerful AI chips, known as graphics processing units (GPUs). These GPUs power crucial AI tasks -- and a high-performance GPU can make a huge difference in the outcome of a customer's AI projects. That's why some fellow Magnificent Seven companies -- as well as other tech giants -- aremajor Nvidia customers. Nvidia hasn't stopped at GPUs, though, and instead has built an entire ecosystem of products and services designed specifically for the AI customer. And the company has even created special platforms for various industries, such as healthcare or automotive. All of this has helped Nvidia's revenue to explode higher in recent years, reaching a record $130 billion in the latest full year. In recent times, though, concern about eventual tariffs on imports as well as government decisions that have barred Nvidia fromexporting its chips to Chinahave hurt demand for the stock. That's because these elements could impact the company's revenue to some degree. As a result, Nvidia stock slipped, leaving the stock trading for 24xforward earnings estimates. This isn't the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven, but it still remains an extremely reasonable price.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Now, let's consider the element that makes the stock a bargain right now, and that could be seen in the chart below. This shows the trailing 12-month sustainable growth rate of Nvidia compared to otherMagnificent Sevenplayers. This metric represents the growth rate expected over time if the company's financial policies don't significantly change.  NVDA Sustainable Growth Rate (TTM)data byYCharts As we can see, Nvidia's is the highest of the bunch. Though Apple is quite close, it's important to note that Apple's sustainable growth rate has been slightly on the decline while Nvidia's has been on the rise. This, combined with Nvidia's current valuation, make the stock look particularly cheap at the moment. Of course, you might say that we don't yet know the level of import tariffs on electronics and if tariffs are higher than expected this could weigh on growth. This is true. But this problem will impact the other Magnificent Seven companies too, hurting their growth prospects -- so they, too, could see lower earnings potential due to this headwind. That means Nvidia still could represent the best deal of the group. Beyond that, though, two other elements make me optimistic about Nvidia. One is that the company is very proactive, recently announcing a major investment in U.S. manufacturing -- thiscould lower its exposureto import tariffs. And second, Nvidia is known for its focus on innovation, with a pledge to update its GPUs on an annual basis. This should keep the company ahead of rivals, spurring significant growth in revenue as the AI boom continues. Nvidia's market leadership and efforts to limit negative tariff impact are positive -- and are reasons to believe the company can maintain a high rate of growth. And this along with the stock's current valuation makes Nvidia the best Magnificent Seven bargain buy right now.",

        "header": "This Incredibly Cheap Semiconductor Stock Is About to Go on a Terrific Bull Run",
        "content": "Share prices ofLam Research(LRCX1.23%)shot up more than 6% following the April 23 release of its fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings (for the three months ended March 30), driven by the company's stronger-than-expected results and guidance that point toward strong demand for its semiconductor manufacturing equipment. So far this year, the stock has been under pressure due to its reliance on China for a large chunk of sales and the turmoil caused by the ongoing tariff war. However, Lam's results and outlook indicate that it is doing well despite those challenges, thanks to the robust demand for its chipmaking equipment sparked by catalysts such asartificial intelligence (AI). Let's take a closer look at the factors driving Lam's growth and examine why this semiconductor stock is worth buying hand over fist right now. Lam Research reported\u00a024% year-over-year growth in revenue for the previous quarter, while its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income grew at a faster pace of 30%. Lam management attributed the impressive growth to the robust demand for leading-edge foundry equipment, which is used in manufacturing advanced chips deployed in AI servers as well as smartphones and personal computers (PCs). Meanwhile, the strong demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) is turning out to be another tailwind for Lam's manufacturing equipment. That's not surprising, as memory equipment accounts for 43% of Lam's total revenue, and memory manufacturers have been ramping up the output of HBM to meet demand from chipmakers such asNvidiaandAdvanced Micro Devices. For instance, memory specialistMicron Technologyexpects theHBM industry to generate $35 billionin revenue this year. That's higher than the $30 billion estimate Micron issued in December last year. This upward revision in the HBM market's growth can be attributed to the growing size of this memory type in the latest AI graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia. Nvidia's latest-generation Blackwell GPUs (graphics processing units) are packing 4 times the memory as compared to the previous generation Hopper processors. Similarly, AMD has increased the HBM capacity on its MI325X AI GPU by 96 gigabytes (GB) over its previous MI300X chip. As a result, it is easy to see why memory manufacturers such as Micron and Samsung\u00a0are investing more money in HBM capacity. With the HBM market expected to exceed $100 billion\u00a0in annual revenue by 2030, Lam Research should ideally witness solid demand for its memory manufacturing equipment over the long run. Another thing worth noting is that Lam Research expects\u00a0to grow at a faster pace than the overall wafer and fabrication equipment (WFE) market. Management believes that the growing complexity of chips, combined with the company's strong product portfolio, places it in a nice position to gain a bigger share of the WFE market. What's more, Lam management says it has \"not seen any meaningful changes to our customers' plans\" amid the tariff-fueled trade war. All this explains why the company's guidance for the current quarter is well ahead of expectations. Lam management said it expects revenue in the current quarter to land at $5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range. That's significantly higher\u00a0than the $4.6 billion consensus estimate. Lam's guidance points toward a potential year-over-year increase of\u00a029% in its top line, an acceleration over the growth it recorded in the previous quarter. Earnings, meanwhile, are expected to increase at a faster pace of 48% thanks to an expansion in margins. Moreover, Lam management believes the company could achieve revenue of $25 billion to $28 billion by 2028, which would be a big jump compared to the $16 billion it generated in 2024. Throw in the company's improving margin profile, and it won't be surprising to see Lam maintaining healthy levels of earnings growth in the future. That's why it would be a good idea for investors to buy thissemiconductor stock, as it is currently trading at less than 20 times trailing earnings, a discount to the tech-ladenNasdaq-100index's trailing earnings multiple of\u00a027. The stock's 12-month price target of $90, as per 33 analysts covering Lam, points toward 26% gains from current levels. But don't be surprised to see it do better than that, thanks to its healthy bottom-line growth, which could encourage the market to reward it with a premium valuation.",

        "content": "U.S. stocks fell for a third consecutive monthin Aprilas uncertainty about President Trump's tariff policies wreaked havoc on Wall Street. The month got off toa dismal startwhen President Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement erased about $6 trillion in market value. Stocks wereboosted mid-monthby a 90-day pause on most of Trump's country-specific tariffs and signs that the White House waseager to de-escalateits trade war with China. But the rebound, hampered on Wednesday by data showingU.S. GDP contractedin the first quarter, wasn't enough to dig stocks out of their hole; the S&P 500 finished April down 0.8%. Tariffs will likely continue to dominate the conversation on Wall Street in May as the torrent of first-quarter earnings reports early in the month slows to a trickle. Below, we look at five stocks to keep an eye on in May. Apple (AAPL) will report its first-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday, May 1, and the focus will be squarely on tariffs. The iPhone maker won a tariff exemption during the first Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China in 2018. Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, Apple has spent the intervening years diversifying its manufacturing base, moving some assembly to countries such as India and Vietnam. Still, the vast majority of Apple products are manufactured in China, putting it squarely in the crosshairs of escalating tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Trump has, for now, exempted smartphones and other Apple products from the\u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffshe announced in early April, which would have raised the duties on Apple products shipped from China, Vietnam, and India by 125%, 46%, and 26%, respectively. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick haswarnedthat exempted consumer electronics will be included in semiconductor-specific tariffs to be announced in the coming months. Analysts and investors will be eager to hear on Apple\u2019s earnings call how the company is planning for the tariffs to come and how it sees a slowing economy affecting sales. Apple shares are down 15% since the start of the year. Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to report quarterly results late in the month, and investors will be anxiously awaiting updates on the company\u2019s sales to China and how it expects a slowdown to affect AI investment. The stock has been dealt a blow this year by rising economic uncertainty and escalating tensions with China. The company recently warned investors that its first-quarter results willtake a hit of up to $5.5 billionafter the U.S. government tightened restrictions on sales to China. On top of that, several leading cloud service providers, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), have reportedly slowed or paused some AI data center buildouts in response to the cloudy economic outlook.Less AI investment from some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies is likely to portend slower sales growth at Nvidia. Nvidia stock has fallen after each of its three most recent earnings reports despiteconsistentlytopping estimates, a sign Wall Street\u2019s expectations have caught up with Nvidia\u2019s breakneck growth. The stock\u2019s response to May\u2019s results could depend on whether the company\u2019s various headwinds have reset investors\u2019 expectations. Nvidia shares are down nearly 19% since the start of the year. Retail giant Walmart (WMT) is slated to report earnings before markets open on May 15. Few companies are in as good of a position to deal with tariffs than Walmart. The company has reportedly pressured Chinese suppliers to lower their prices, a tactic unavailable to smaller retailers.It has also had some success getting through to the White House; Trump expressed interest in de-escalating the trade war with China shortly after Walmart, Target, and Costco executives reportedly warned the president that prohibitively high tariffs would eventually lead to empty shelves across the country. Walmart\u2019s first-quarter sales are unlikely to be affected by tariffs, the majority of which were announced in April. Retail sales data also suggests consumers, despitecratering confidencein the economy,didn\u2019t slow their spendingin the first quarter. The company\u2019s guidance will be of greater interest to Wall Street\u2014that is, if it issues guidance. Many companies have withdrawn their full-year forecasts, citing the difficulty of predicting future costs and demand without clarity on trade policy. If Walmart were to do the same, it could ratchet up the anxiety on Wall Street and send shockwaves through the stock market. Walmart shares are up nearly 8% year-to-date. ExxonMobil (XOM) is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings before markets open on Friday, and the Trump administration will likely loom large over the report. Trump walked a tightrope throughout last year\u2019s presidential campaign, promising to tame inflation by lowering energy costs while also casting himself as an ally of America\u2019s fossil fuel industry. In office, he has tried to smooth over the tensions between those two goals. Trump has taken steps to remove regulatory barriers to resource extraction, expedite the permitting of drilling on federal lands, and prevent states from impeding his program to \u201cunleash American energy.\u201d At the same time, Trump\u2019s trade war has raised the odds of a U.S. recession, causing oil prices to slump. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, closed at about $58 a barrel on Wednesday, its lowest price in 4 years and below what the average producerneeds to profitably drilla new well. Exxon\u2019s results and commentary could help investors understand the balance of good and bad news for the industry coming out of Washington. ExxonMobil stock has fallen about 2% since the start of the year. Coinbase (COIN) is also set to report first-quarter earnings this month, and the future appears bright for the crypto exchange. The cryptocurrency industry has emerged as one of the few winners of the second Trump administration thus far. Trump has ordered the creation of aStrategic Bitcoin Reserveand a U.S. Digital Assets Stockpile, installed crypto-advocatePaul Atkinsas the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, andwound downmajor federal lawsuits against the crypto industry. The prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether have declined since Trump took office, battered by the same economic uncertainty that\u2019s hammered the stock and bond markets. That could take a bite out of Coinbase\u2019s transaction revenue, which as of mid-February was on track to surpass last year\u2019s first quarter. Nonetheless, Coinbase forecast subscription and services revenue\u2014less volatile than transaction revenue, which fluctuates with crypto prices\u2014would grow as much as 50%. Investors will be listening to Coinbase\u2019s earnings call for insights into the company\u2019s efforts to shape the cryptocurrency legislation and regulations being developed in Washington. Coinbase shares are down about 18% so far this year.",

        "content": "TheNasdaq-100is home to 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, including each of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which have a combined value of $15 trillion. In other words, it's a great proxy for the performance of the technology and technology-adjacent industries. The Nasdaq-100 was down by as much as 23% from its record high in April, placing the index in a technical bear market. Investors have flocked to the safety of cash amid growing economic and political uncertainty, triggered by the tariffs President Donald Trump recently enacted on imported products from America's trading partners. However, if history is any guide, this might actually be a great time to buy the index. TheInvesco QQQ Trust(QQQ0.17%)is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 by maintaining an identical portfolio of stocks, so it offers investors a simple way to own the entire index. Image source: Getty Images. TheMagnificent Sevenis a group of seven of the largest stocks in the U.S. Wall Street analysts gave them the nickname in 2023 not just for their size, but also because they have consistently led the broader market higher over the last few years. They represent a whopping 41.3% of the total value of theInvesco QQQ Trust(and the Nasdaq-100), so they have a massive influence over its performance: Stock Invesco ETF Portfolio Weighting Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 8.76% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 8.12% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 7.55% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 5.58% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 5.14% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 3.34% Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 2.89% Data source: Invesco. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 25, 2025, and are subject to change. The Magnificent Seven stocks are down by an average of 15% this year amid the broader market sell-off, led by Tesla, which has declined 29% on the back ofsoft demand for the company's electric vehicles. But the downside for the rest of this group might be short-lived given their earnings power. Alphabet, for example, just delivered amuch stronger set of financial resultsthan Wall Street expected in the first quarter of 2025, with itsnet income(profit) rocketing higher by 46% year over year. Looking beyond the recent quarter,artificial intelligence(AI) could be a long-term tailwind for Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft because of their growing portfolio of AI services that they sell via theircloud platforms. They offer industry-leading data center infrastructure and a selection of ready-madelarge language models(LLMs), which are two of the main ingredients developers need to create AI software. In fact, each of them is experiencing more demand for computing capacity than they can supply, which is a big tailwind for another member of the Magnificent Seven: Nvidia. The company makes the world's most advanced chips for processing AI workloads, and its data center revenue surged by 142% to $115.2 billion during its fiscal year 2025 (ended Jan. 26). The result contributed to a record $2.99 in earnings per share, and following the recent dip in its stock, Nvidia is now trading at abargain valuation relative to its 10-year average. But the Invesco QQQ Trust isn't entirely about the Magnificent Seven. In its list of top-20 holdings, investors will also find streaming giantNetflix, retail powerhouseCostco Wholesale, telecommunications providerT-Mobile, and AI software dynamoPalantir Technologies. This Invesco ETF has weathered no less thanfiveotherbear marketssince it was established in 1999, and each of them was triggered by a unique economic shock: But even after accounting for all of those bear markets -- and every smaller sell-off in between -- this Invesco ETF still delivered a compound annual return of 10% between 1999 and 2024. The current bear market is unlikely to derail that long-term trend. President Trump has already pared back some of thetariffshe announced on \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, and his administration says dozens of countries have come to the table to negotiate new trade deals. A similar sequence of events followed Trump's first round of tariffs in 2018, and it paved the way for a whopping 38% gain in the Nasdaq-100 the very next year. Plus, the tariffs only impact physical imports, which means software, cloud services, and other digital goods aren't facing any penalties (yet). That's great news for companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. Moreover, semiconductors are exempt from the more aggressive portion of Trump's tariffs because the president wants the U.S. to remain a leader in the AI race. That benefits Nvidia, in addition toBroadcom,Advanced Micro Devices, andMicron Technology, which are also in the Nasdaq-100. As a result, patient investors might want to use the current bear market in the Nasdaq-100 as an opportunity to take a long-term position in the Invesco QQQ Trust.",

        "content": "Theartificial intelligence(AI) revolution promises to transform virtually every aspect of our economy. According to leading research firms, the economic impact could reach trillions of dollars annually as AI technologies boost productivity across industries. For investors seeking to capitalize on this technological transformation, selecting the right investment vehicle is crucial. Among the surfeit of available options, oneexchange-traded fund(ETF) stands out as a particularly efficient way to gain exposure to this revolution: theInvesco QQQ Trust(QQQ0.17%), which tracks the performance of theNasdaq-100index. Read on to find out more about this incredible tech ETF. Image source: Getty Images. While Wall Street analystsforecastthis technology-focused ETF to deliver returns exceeding 15% for 2025, the Invesco QQQ Trust has, instead, declined 7.4% four months into the year, largely due to President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. This substantial pullback potentially presents a compelling entry point for investors with long-term perspectives. The Invesco QQQ Trust's particular appeal for AI exposure lies in its concentrated holdings of technology leaders. The fund provides investors with direct stakes in companies at the forefront of developing and deploying advanced AI technologies across multiple sectors, positioning it uniquely within the investment landscape to capture the AI revolution's parabolic growth potential. This fund's exceptional long-term track record illustrates the power of its laser focus on high-tech. Over the past 10 years, it has generated cumulative returns of approximately 370%. By comparison, theS&P 500's impressive 215% cumulative gain over the same period, while historically strong, significantly trails the Invesco QQQ's breathtaking performance.  QQQ Total Return Leveldata byYCharts. Perhaps best of all, this market-beating performance comes with a reasonableexpense ratioof 0.20%, so investors pay just $20 annually per $10,000 invested. Though the fund charges higher fees than most basic S&P 500 index funds, this cost is justified, given its focused exposure to high-growth technology companies positioned to deliver outsized returns for years to come -- potentially. The fund offers investors concentrated exposure to the AI revolution through its significant holdings in technology leaders.Microsoft(7.8% of the fund) has become a frontrunner in enterprise AI following its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI. This strategic partnership has transformed Microsoft's product ecosystem, with AI capabilities now embedded throughout its cloud services and productivity applications, positioning the company to capture substantial value from the enterprise AI adoption wave. Nvidia(7.4%) has emerged as perhaps the most critical infrastructure provider for the AI revolution. The company's specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the industry standard for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, creating unprecedented demand from technology companies worldwide and driving exceptional revenue growth for this key fund holding. Alphabet(2.4%) leverages AI to strengthen its core search business while exploring breakthrough applications across diverse domains. The company's DeepMind division has achieved landmark AI accomplishments in scientific research, while Google Cloud continues expanding its AI offerings for enterprise customers. Through these three companies alone, representing over 17% of its holdings, the fund provides investors with significant exposure to the bedrock of the AI revolution. For investors seeking substantial exposure to the AI transformation without selecting individual winners, the Invesco Trust offers an elegant solution. Rather than betting on specific AI applications, investors gain access to the entire ecosystem -- from chip designers and cloud infrastructure providers to companies implementing AI solutions at scale. As a result, the recent market pullback presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors. While current trade tensions may create volatility, the advancement of AI continues uninterrupted. As AI transforms industries from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment, companies leading this revolution will likely strengthen their competitive advantages further, and best of all, fatten their margins through efficiency gains. With concentrated exposure to technology innovators, proven long-term performance, and reasonable fees, this Nasdaq-100 tracking fund represents one of the most efficient vehicles for investors seeking to participate in the next phase of the digital revolution.",

        "content": "With shares down nearly 20% year to date,Nvidia(NVDA-0.24%)had a rough start to 2025. The massive artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker has proven vulnerable to trade and geopolitical uncertainty during the opening months of the Trump administration, which could seriously undermine its business in China. Let's dig deeper to determine whether investors should view this dip as a buying opportunity or a signal to stay away from Nvidia stock. Nvidia's China trouble came to a head on April 16 when the Trump administration imposed new restrictions on the exports of its H20 AI chips to the country. This hardware was specifically designed to comply with Biden-era regulations, which blocked sales of its more powerful flagship chips like the A100 and H100 to China.The new ban led to a $5.5 billionimpairment chargeas Nvidia must now write down the value of its massive inventory and purchase commitments for the H20 program. This situation is quite complicated for Nvidia, as it offers a mix of potential advantages and disadvantages.For starters, the H20 is believed to have helped the Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek develop its R1 and V3 models, which can match American industry leader ChatGPT on some benchmarks at a fraction of the cost. Intense competition from China promises to squeeze potential margins in the AI software market, which could undermine Nvidia's biggest clients, includingOpenAI,Alphabet, andMeta Platforms.As a result, these companies may become less willing to invest billions into an industry trapped in a race to the bottom. By selling H20 chips to China, Nvidia may have been hurting the long-term viability of its U.S.-reliant business model. And the chip ban may actually have a stabilizing effect on the U.S. AI industry by slowing down Chinese progress, although this theory is far from guaranteed. On April 27, Chinese tech giantHuaweiannounced plans to test its newest and most powerful AI processor, called the 910D, which is designed to replace Nvidia's products in the country. By banning Nvidia's H20 in China, the U.S. may have inadvertently created a less competitive environment, allowing Chinese rivals to develop their domestic chip-design capabilities and eventually imitate Nvidia's business model. The good news is that Nvidia'seconomic moatrelies on its software solution, CUDA, which makes it easier for developers to use its chips relative to rivals. And while Huawei could eventually dominate the Chinese market, it is unlikely to challenge Nvidia's dominance outside of China anytime soon. Even experienced chipmakers likeAdvanced Micro Devices,Intel,andBroadcomhave yet to crack Nvidia's dominance (with a market share of 70% to 95%) in the AI chip market. Image source: Getty Images. Over the long term, Chinese developers could use low-cost chips designed by Huawei and other companies to compete with American AI on consumer-facing software. However, the loss of access to Nvidia products could slow them down enough for Nvidia's top clients to maintain their lead. Nvidia's recent dip reflects more than just a reduction of hype in the AI industry. The Trump administration's decision to block the company's H20 sales to China will have a significant impact on its long-term growth. In fiscal 2025, Nvidia's China business accounted for approximately $7.9 billion, or 6% of its total sales of $130.5 billion, which is a substantial amount. With geopolitical tensions on the rise, it may not be in Nvidia's best interest to continue developing specialized AI chips for the Chinese market, given the risk of continued bans. That said, with a forwardprice-to-earnings(P/E) multiple of 25, Nvidia's valuation still looks reasonable, considering its growth rate. Fourth-quarter profits jumped 80% year over year to $19.3 billion. But stocks are only worth what someone else is willing to pay for them. Investors may doubt Nvidia's ability to sustain its epic growth rate, especially in such a speculative industry that isn't yet a significant part of the mainstream economy. Shares look like a hold until more information becomes available.",

        "content": "Despite Wall Street's optimistic outlook for big tech in 2025, most technology stocks have struggled significantly during the first four months of the year. TheNasdaq-100, which consists of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, has declined by nearly 7% year-to-date at the time of this writing. While sharp marketwide corrections can be unnerving, history consistently demonstrates that these periods often create exceptional wealth-building opportunities for investors with a long-term perspective. Currently, investors have a rare chance to acquire shares in several world-classartificial intelligence(AI) pioneers at substantial discounts to their long-term commercial potential. Specifically, the following three Nasdaq-listed tech giants present compelling buying opportunities after a challenging start to 2025. Image source: Getty Images. With shares down a staggering 19% year-to-date,Nvidia(NVDA-0.24%)presents an exceptional buying opportunity amid the broader tech sell-off of 2025. This correction stands in stark contrast to Nvidia's strengthening position as the foundational hardware provider powering virtually every significant AI advancement. The company's specializedgraphics processing units(GPUs) have become indispensable infrastructure for AI development, creating a competitive advantage that rivals have failed to overcome. Nvidia's dominance extends beyond traditional computing into the emerging field of physical AI, where its Jetson platform enables sophisticated robotics applications that translate digital intelligence into real-world actions. This technological leadership has translated into extraordinary financial performance, with annual revenue jumping by a staggering 383% over the prior three years (see graph below).  NVDA Revenue (Annual)data byYCharts So, for investors with the foresight to look beyond current market volatility, Nvidia's recent sell-off may represent not just a stellar buying opportunity but a potential wealth-creation inflection point. After all, the AI titan will undoubtedly be a primary beneficiary of this unstoppable tech transformation, opening a multitrillion-dollar commercial opportunity for the company in the decades ahead. In stark contrast to the broader tech market decline,Palantir Technologies(PLTR2.15%)has surged a remarkable 52% year-to-date, significantly outperforming virtually all of its major tech peers. The stock's ability to swim against the current, so to speak, is a testament to Palantir's unique positioning at the intersection of data analytics, AI, and mission-critical operations. Its demonstrated strength in a soft market serves to underscore why its stock is a standout buy this month. Palantir's software platforms, Gotham, Foundry, and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), give organizations the ability to integrate massive datasets and deploy AI capabilities across their operations. What distinguishes Palantir is its proven ability to transform raw, disparate data into actionable intelligence through AI-powered analysis. Furthermore, the company has established deep relationships with government agencies and defense departments worldwide, providing a stable revenue foundation. Meanwhile, its commercial business has accelerated dramatically as enterprises across industries recognize the value of Palantir's tools for implementing practical AI solutions. With its established government relationships, expanding commercial presence, and purpose-built AI deployment platform, Palantir represents a different but equally compelling AI investment compared to hardware-focused companies like Nvidia. As a result, this red-hot tech stock should appeal to investors seeking exposure to the software and implementation side of the AI revolution even after rising in price. Among broader tech market volatility,ASML Holding(ASML0.46%)has experienced a modest 5.2% year-to-date decline. This pullback belies ASML's critical position in the AI value chain as the sole manufacturer of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines required to produce the world's most advanced semiconductor chips. What makes ASML uniquely valuable is its monopoly on the equipment necessary for manufacturing the advanced chips that power AI applications. While short-term concerns about quarterly orders have weighed on the stock this year, the long-term demand signals remain extraordinarily compelling. Major chipmakers likeTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Companyand SK Hynix are significantly increasing their capital expenditures to meet the exploding demand for AI-capable semiconductors, with TSMC raising its spending by 34% and SK Hynix reportedly boosting its 2025 investment by 30% to $20 billion. With this backdrop in mind, ASML's soft start to the year looks like a tremendous buying opportunity for investors who want exposure to a foundational AI infrastructure player.",

        "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) shares tumbled Thursday morning after the mobile chip designerissued a light\u00a0revenue outlookthat overshadowed better-than-expected quarterly results. While the company said it doesn\u2019t currently anticipate any material impact from tariffs, and that it had not seen elevated pre-emptive product purchasing ahead of possible import duties during the quarter, it cautioned the situation could change due to unpredictableU.S.-China trade tensions. Qualcomm\u2019s shares were down 8% at around $136 in recent trading. The stock has lost about 17% of its value over the past 12 months, due in part to concerns that the company could see a significant decline inrevenueas key customer Apple (AAPL) ramps up production of in-house chips to power its devices. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Qualcomm\u2019s chart and identify major price levels investors may be watching. Qualcomm shares had been entrenched in a multi-monthdescending channelsince setting theirrecord highlast June. More recently, the stock rallied from the pattern\u2019s lower trendline, which coincided with therelative strength index (RSI)crossing back above the 50 threshold to signal accelerating price momentum. However, the buying enthusiasm ended abruptly Thursday, potentially paving the way for the stock to resume its longer-termdowntrend. Let\u2019s point out two major price levels on Qualcomm\u2019s chart where the shares could encountersupport, while also identifying important overhead areas that could come into play during potential upswings. Investors should initially keep tabs of the $135 level. The shares may find support in this area near the mid-April dip and the low of aretracementthat formed on the chart early last year during an extendeduptrend. A more significant drop could see the shares revisit lower support around $126. Investors may seekentry pointsin this location near trading activity positioned just above last month\u2019s low, which also closely aligns with the bottom range of aconsolidationperiod in late 2023. Future upswings in the stock could lead to a test of overheadresistanceat $153. This area on the chart, currently just above the popular50-day moving average, may provide selling pressure near a trendline that connects a range of troughs stretching from August to March. Finally, abreakoutabove this technically significant level could fuel a move to the $176 area. Investors may look to offload Qualcomm shares in this region near ahorizontal linethat links a string of closely aligned peaks on the chart stretching back to March last year.

        "content": "Shares ofNvidia(NVDA2.39%)charged sharply higher Thursday, climbing as much as 5.5%. As of 11:59 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 4.4%. The catalysts that sent theartificial intelligence (AI)chipmaker higher were several developments that suggest strong demand for its processors will likely continue. Microsoft(MSFT7.55%)released its fiscal 2025 third-quarter financial report after market close on Wednesday, and investors were pleasantly surprised by the robust results. Revenue of $70 billion climbed 13% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.46 jumped 18%. Analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $68.4 billion and EPS of $3.20, so Microsoft sailed past expectations. The company credited accelerating demand for its cloud services and AI offerings for fueling its impressive growth. CEO Satya Nadella also downplayed reports that Microsoft was pulling back on data center spending, which would have been bad news for Nvidia. Meta Platforms(META4.29%)also made a splash. In the first quarter, revenue of $42.3 billion jumped 16%, fueling EPS of $6.43, which grew 37%. The figures were well ahead of Wall Street's expectations for revenue of $41.27 billion and EPS of $5.22. The biggest surprise, however, was Meta's announcement that it is boosting its 2025capital expenditures (capex)from its previous range of $60 billion to $65 billion to $64 billion to $72 billion. The company mentioned AI 78 times during its conference call, and some of that increased spending is earmarked for AI. As the leading supplier of the graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to support AI and data center growth, Nvidia stands to gain from this increased spending. Finally, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stoked excitement with comments he made in an interview withThe Wall Street Journal. He posited that every American company would need to adopt AI \"factories\" in order to remain competitive. These virtual factories are designed to continually create AI models for specific functions and will be the \"engine\" that supports AI development, according to Huang. Investors have been concerned that the pace of AI adoption might be slowing, but this trio of developments suggests the road ahead is long. Furthermore, at less than 26 times forward sales, Nvidia represents an attractive way to profit from the AI revolution.",

        "content": "Anthropologists studying the cultural habits of a certain type of American investor could do no better than to join the thousands who make the annual pilgrimage to Omaha, Neb., whereWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) holds its annual shareholder meeting each May. Most corporate annual meetings are exercises in tedium\u2014scripted affairs where management reads prepared statements, shareholders vote on preset proposals, and everyone shuffles out while still stifling yawns. But those arriving in Omaha find an often raucous affair, complete with memorabilia, investment wisdom, and recollections of storied moments from past meetings. In recent years, anyone with an internet connection could watch a livestream of the festivities. But Berkshire shareholders and followers of Buffett'svalue investing philosophyhave still felt drawn to attend in person.Tyler Crowe, an analyst for the Motley Fool, described it as \"making the pilgrimage\" after attending the meeting in 2023. With Buffett now in his 90s, he said, \"It's not going to last forever, and so from that perspective, I felt like I absolutely needed to do it.\" For others, it's about being in a room with like-minded people and fellow \"finance nerds.\" \"It's like a stadium of 20,000 people who think like me, and it's really a refreshing kind of gathering,\"Certified Financial PlannerMatt Frankel said in a video on his YouTube channel. The heart of the Berkshire gathering is a marathon Q&A, during which Buffett, alongside key lieutenants, speaks candidly for up to five hours. Buffett takes pride in the unscripted nature of these exchanges, which are far from the highly scripted communications typical of public companies. For the 2025 meeting, Buffett said he would take questions from in-person shareholders, \"selected randomly to ask whatever they wish,\" and from CNBC host Becky Quick, who would curate a list of questions from shareholders not in attendance.Greg Abeland Ajit Jain, vice chairs for Berkshire, will join him. \"The three of us will not get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked,\" Buffett said in the 2025 shareholders guide. \"We know you and Becky will pick some tough ones and that\u2019s the way we like it.\" Question topics typically range from specificBerkshire investmentsto broad economic trends, and frompersonal philosophytolife advice. Many attendees take studious notes, hoping that a single Buffett insight might improve their investment returns for decades to come. The actual business portion of the meeting, which takes place after the Q&A session, is remarkably brief, lasting only about 20 minutes despite Berkshire's enormous size and complexity. Joining the Berkshire experience is surprisingly easy. Here'show to do it: The Berkshire meeting has produced many moments that have become part of investing lore: For one weekend each May, Omaha hosts the investment world's most unlikely festival. Buffett's \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" brings together global billionaires and regular investors with savings in Berkshire stock. Unlike Wall Street's typical emphasis on quarterly results and disruption, the Berkshire meeting celebrates the quintessentially midwestern values of patience and simplicity. For many investors, attending at least once has become a genuine bucket-list experience.",

        "header": "Nvidia Is Jumping Today -- Is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA2.39%)stock is rising Thursday amid a bullish backdrop for the broader market. The company's share price was up 4.4% as of 1:15 p.m. ET. At the same point in the day's trading, theS&P 500index was up 0.9% and theNasdaq Compositehad risen 1.8%. Earlier in the session, Nvidia stock had been up as much as 5.5%. MicrosoftandMeta Platformsreported quarterly results after the market closed yesterday, and strong results and guidance from both companies is helping to push Nvidia's valuation higher today. But even with today's gains, Nvidia stock is still down roughly 24% year to date as of this writing. Microsoft is reportedly Nvidia's biggest customer, and Meta is said to be the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware leader's second-biggest client. With their recent quarterly reports, Microsoft and Meta have helped bolster the bull case for Nvidia stock. In addition to posting sales and earnings beats that were heavily driven by AI technologies and services, both companies signaled that they are continuing to spend heavily on artificial intelligence processors. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft reportednon-GAAP(adjusted) capital expenditures (capex) of $16.75 billion in the third quarter of its current fiscal year, which ended March 31. Capex was up 53% year over year in the period. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate had called for capex to come in at $16.37 billion. Meta's new capex forecast also brought good news for Nvidia investors. The social media giant now forecasts its capex for this year to be between $64 billion and $72 billion -- a big leap from its previous guidance for between $60 billion and $65 billion. Microsoft's and Meta's capital expenditures are heavily focused on expanding their AI infrastructures, and Nvidia's advanced processors are the key hardware that underpins success in the space. The new capex data appears to mute the significance of recent reports that Microsoft and other tech giants were scaling back their data center plans and suggests that demand for AI hardware continues to be very strong. So while Nvidia stock will likely continue to see volatility in conjunction with moves for the broader market, the long-term investment thesis appears to be intact.",

        "content": "Wall Street is partying like it's 2024. Shares of techmega-capssoared on Thursday as strong earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) breathed fresh life into the AI trade that's fueled stock market gains for the past two years. Microsoft and Meta both beat expectations with their quarterly results on Wednesday. Microsoft reported a21% increasein cloud revenue, while Meta said its AI isapproaching 1 billion monthly active users. The resultsboostedbeaten-down AI and Big Tech stocks. Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which entered Thursday's session down 19% since the start of the year, was up about 4% in recent trading. Nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG), whose stocks soared last year on booming demand for electricity to powerAI data centers, were up more than 6% and 8%, respectively, lifting both stocks into positive territory for the year. Networking tech company Arista Networks (ANET), down about 30%year-to-dateas of Wednesday, jumped more than 7%. AI stocks were hit hard by this year's market mayhem. AI stocks sold off in late January after advances byChinese startup DeepSeekcalled into question the economic assumptions underpinning the AI trade. That panic was followed by President Donald Trump's global trade war, which sent investorsracing into safe havensamid mounting concerns about a worldwide economic slowdown. The economic uncertainty appeared to be taking a toll on AI investment. Microsoft's head of cloud operations last month said the company was pausing work on some AI data centers in their early phases, and Amazon was reportedly mulling slowing its data-center expansion. Microsoft and Meta's results put those concerns to bed\u2014at least for now. Microsoft reiterated its plan to spend $80 billion this year, and Meta said it will boost its capital expenditures tobetween $64 billion and $72 billionto boost AI capacity.Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) also stood by its big AI spending plans when it reportedsolid earningslast week. Executives on Wednesday justified their big spending plans by pointing to continued strong demand for AI services. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood told analysts demand was still higher than the company could satisfy, and that it would likely \u201chave some AI capacity constraints beyond June.\u201d The results also gave investors some evidence that AI investments are paying off. MetaCEO Mark Zuckerbergtold analysts Wednesday that AI-driven content recommendations had increased time spent on its platforms by between 6% and 35% in the last six months. \u201cAs we look around and ask the question, \u2018What\u2019s the return on investment on AI?\u2019 Meta is actually showing tangible examples of that,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on Wednesday. \u201cAll the potential that drove AI stocks higher in2024remains intact,\u201d Munster and his colleague Brian Baker wrote at the height of last month's tariff-induced chaos. \u201cAt Deepwater, we continue to believe there are still 2\u20133 years left in thisbull market.\u201d",

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher on Thursday after strong quarterly earnings reports from software giant Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) helped alleviate some concerns about the possible impact of tariffs on big technology companies. The S&P 500 jumped 0.6%, extending its winning streak to eight consecutive trading sessions. The Dow added 0.2%, while a strong day for the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq 1.5%. Shares of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) company Carrier Global (CARR) soared 11.6% to log the S&P 500's top performance on Thursday. The gains followed astrong quarterly reportthat saw Carrier top sales and profit estimates while boosting its full-year outlook. Quanta Services (PWR)\u00a0shares jumped 9.9% after the provider of electric and utility contracting services also posted better-than-expected top- and bottom-line results for the first quarter of 2025. Quanta touted an improvement in profitability in its Electric Infrastructure Solutions and its Underground and Infrastructure Solutions segments, which the company said suggested resilience and adaptability in the face of shifting market conditions. Microsoft's sales and profits for its fiscal third quarter alsoexceeded analysts' forecasts, and shares of the tech behemoth surged 7.6%. The company highlighted dynamic growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment, home to its Azure cloud computing business. The firm's chief financial officer (CFO) also discussed the promising trajectory for artificial intelligence (AI) demand and affirmed Microsoft's plans for $80 billion in infrastructure spending throughout fiscal 2025. Medical device manufacturer Becton Dickinson (BDX) reduced its full-year profit forecast, citing the potential impact from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Its shares plunged 18.1%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock. Following the guidance cut, analysts at a variety of research firms downgraded Becton Dickinson stock, citing inconsistencies in the company's execution and a lack of confidence in its ability to drive growth. Eli Lilly (LLY) topped sales and profit estimates with its first-quarter results, driven by strong sales of its GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes treatments. However, the pharmaceutical giant alsocut its full-year profit guidance, reflecting a charge related to its acquisition of a cancer treatment. Shares of Eli Lilly dropped 11.6% on Thursday. Underwhelming guidance also weighed on shares of semiconductor giant Qualcomm (QCOM), which sank 9.0%.

Azure growth accelerated to 35% (cc) in the quarter, well ahead of analysts' forecasts. CFO Amy Hood on Wednesday's earnings call noted that, despite recent economic uncertainty, AI demand continued to grow faster than Microsoft's supply.
