        "content": "Tesla(TSLA2.41%)stock has tumbled 30% year to date due to dismal financial results and market share losses. The company's performance ranks among the worst in theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), but CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made the same bold claim. The five largest companies --Apple,Microsoft,Nvidia,Amazon, andAlphabet-- were worth nearly $15 trillion when Musk first said Tesla could surpass their combined market values. The implied 17-fold return from its current market value of $879 billion means $50,000 invested in Tesla stock today could be worth $850,000 in the future. That alone would not make you a millionaire, but the potential upside is still compelling. Here's what investors should know. Earlier this month, Tesla said first-quarter vehicle deliveries declined 13% to 336,681, the lowest total in three years. That led to disastrous first-quarter financial results that missed estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue fell 9% to $19.3 billion,operating margincontracted to a six-year low, andnon-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles)net income plunged 40% to $0.27 per share. Tesla also withheld guidance due to uncertainty created by shifting U.S. trade policies, but investors did get some good news on the quarterly earnings call. CEO Elon Musk reiterated plans to launch an autonomous ride-sharing (robotaxi) service in Austin by June and said Tesla would have thousands of autonomous robots working in its factories this year. Those updates are particularly important because Musk says his confidence that Tesla can become the most valuable company is \"overwhelmingly due toautonomous vehiclesandautonomous humanoid robots.\" Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's Waymo is currently the market leader in autonomous ride-sharing. Its robotaxis provide more than 250,000 rides weekly across several major U.S. cities, and the company is expanding to new metropolitan areas at a steady clip: Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., are next. But Tesla could catch up quickly due to two advantages. First, Tesla has more camera-equipped vehicles on the road collecting video, which means it has moretraining datato inform theartificial intelligence (AI)models that power its full self-driving (FSD) software. And second, Waymo uses an expensive combination of cameras, radar, and lidar to power its robotaxis, whereas Tesla relies solely on computer vision. That strategy is not only less costly -- Waymo spends $100,000 on equipment alone for its cars, while Tesla can build Cybercabs for less than $30,000 -- but also more scalable. Lidar requires high-definition maps, so Waymo must map streets in meticulous detail before its robotaxis can function. Comparatively, Tesla should be able to launch autonomous ride-sharing without maps almost anywhere once FSD is perfected. Musk thinks Tesla will capture 99% market share in autonomous ride-sharing. \"I don't see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,\" he told analysts on the most recent earnings call. Musk expects robotaxis to \"move the financial needle in a significant way\" for Tesla by the middle of next year. Adam Jonas atMorgan Stanleyestimates Tesla will have 900,000 robotaxis on the road in 2035 and that each will earn about $93,800 in revenue. That implies total revenue exceeding $84 billion. Jonas expects $17 billion will hit the bottom line and thinks that figure could surpass $120 billion by 2040. Wall Street estimates Tesla's adjusted earnings will increase by 15% annually through 2026. That consensus makes the current valuation of 130 times adjusted earnings look absurdly expensive, especially since Tesla missed the consensus estimate by an average of 7% in the last four quarters, according to LSEG. However, autonomous driving and humanoid robots represent massive opportunities. For instance, Morgan Stanley says Tesla's revenue could increase at 20% annually for the next 20 years if it executes on those opportunities. This implies faster earnings growth because robotaxis and robots would come with higher margins than electric cars. In that scenario, the current valuation may look quite reasonable in hindsight. In summary, this is a tricky stock. Investors who lack conviction in Musk's vision should avoid it. There are plenty of other stocks worth owning. But investors who think Tesla can disrupt the global mobility and labor markets (with autonomous cars and robots) should absolutely own a position.",

        "header": "Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got the Best News of 2025 (So Far) From Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Microsoft",
        "content": "The past few years have been a whirlwind forNvidia(NVDA2.33%)investors. The onset of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution led to scorching demand for thegraphics processing units (GPUs)that make AI possible. As the leading provider of these advanced chips, Nvidia has been one of the undisputed beneficiaries, with its stock growing more than eightfold in the two years heading into 2025. In recent months, however, the narrative has turn turned decidedly pessimistic. The combination of U.S. export restrictions and concerns about slowing of the AI spending boom has weighed on Nvidia stock, which is down roughly 25% from its peak (as of this writing). However, commentary from three of the company's biggest customers provided much-needed good news for Nvidia investors. Image source: Getty Images. The demand for data centers and servers with the computational horsepower needed for AI fueled a big run-up in capex spending by big tech. This spending helped fuel massive sales increases for Nvidia, as its data center segment generated six consecutive quarters of triple-digit year-over-year growth. However, numerous reports suggested that some of Nvidia's biggest customers were scaling back on data center spending, which sent the stock plunging. But the devil's in the details, and it turns out the sky is not falling after all. WhenMicrosoft(MSFT2.31%)released the financial report for its fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended March 31), the results were surprisingly robust and driven by strong demand for AI. The highlight was Azure Cloud, which grew 33% year over year and accelerated from 31% growth in Q2. Perhaps more impressive was the revelation that 16% points of that growth was related to AI services, up from 13% points in Q2. CEO Satya Nadella downplayed the reports of a slowdown in data center spending, noting this was merely the normal ebb and flow of regional data center planning. \"We've always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build, all through the last 10-15 years,\" Nadella said. He went on to say the company wants to ensure that the regional data center build-outs match the demand. They don't want to be \"upside down,\" having too much capacity in one region and not enough in another. There were similar concerns of a slowdown in data center spending forAmazon(AMZN-0.20%). Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, refuted the reports. \"There's been really no significant change,\" he noted. \"We continue to see very strong demand, and we're looking both in the next couple of years as well as long term and seeing the numbers only going up.\" WhenMeta Platforms(META4.30%)reported its first-quarter results, the company made a surprise announcement that turned heads. The company revealed plans to increase its 2025capital expenditures (capex)spending to $68 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, up from its previous forecast of about $62.5 billion. The company said, \"This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts, as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.\" As the leading provider of GPUs used to power AI in data centers, Nvidia is poised to benefit from the ongoing data center build-out. This will support the ongoing and accelerating adoption of AI. Lest there be any doubt, the three aforementioned companies are among the biggest players in AIandare among Nvidia's biggest customers. While the chipmaker has kept the exact order close to the vest, analysts with Bloomberg andBarclays Researchsuggest that Nvidia's four biggest customers -- responsible for nearly 53% of its revenue -- are: Recent commentary from several of these tech stalwarts refutes the contention that spending on data centers and AI is slowing. It seems clear that the AI revolution is alive and well, but there are still challenges ahead for Nvidia. The tariff situation remains a wild card and is subject to change from day to day. If the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration linger, chip prices could climb, and Nvidia's results could suffer. Additionally, some investors are still wary of the future adoption of AI and how it will impact the company's future growth. This negativity has persisted, despite evidence to the contrary. However, for investors with a long-term outlook, Nvidia looks increasingly compelling. The stock is currently selling for 39 times trailing-12-month earnings, with the multiple near its lowest point in over three years. Furthermore, its forwardprice-to-earnings ratioof 26 is an attractive price to pay for a company powering the AI revolution.",

        "header": "5 Growth Stocks to Buy in May and Go Away",
        "content": "Nearly every investor has heard the adage, \"Sell in May and go away.\" The premise is that stock market returns are often lower between May and October than from November to April. Historically, there has been some support for this approach (although not so much in recent years). I have a different suggestion, though. Here are five growth stocks to buy in May and go away (i.e., hold them for the long term). Image source: Getty Images. Amazon's(AMZN-0.20%)share price remains more than 20% below its previous high. Every time the stock has declined this much in the past, it has presented a fantastic buying opportunity. I think this trend will continue. We could talk about Amazon's latest quarterly results or the potential impact oftariffson its business. The more important point with Amazon, though, is its long-term prospects -- which are very bright. The company still has plenty of room to expand its e-commerce business. Amazon Web Services leads the cloud services market and should enjoy a massive tailwind from artificial intelligence (AI) over the next decade and beyond. Amazon also continues to enter new markets, most recently launching the first of its Project Kuiper satellites that will provide high-speed internet across the world. Meta Platforms(META4.30%)might be the Rodney Dangerfield of the AI world. In my view, the company doesn't get the respect it deserves, but I think that could change in the not-too-distant future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently revealed that Meta AI has almost 1 billion monthly active users. That number should increase now that the generative AI app is available onApple's App Store andAlphabet's Google Play Store. The company is also making solid progress with its smart glasses development, an area that I predict will pay off handsomely over the next few years. In the meantime, Meta remains a cash cow. Its apps reach 3.43 billion active users every day -- nearly 42% of the entire world population. That's an audience that will keep attracting advertisersandkeep money flowing into Meta's coffers. Speaking of getting no respect these days, the claws have come out in recent months forNvidia(NVDA2.33%). Granted, there has been some bad news for thegraphics processing unit (GPU)maker, such as the Trump administration's planned ban on exports of some AI chips to China. However, don't count Nvidia out. The company is still the undisputed leader of the AI chip market. The demand for its new Blackwell GPUs is intense. Reports that Nvidia's major customers (including Amazon) were slowing their AI expansion plans were overblown. Will Nvidia return to the dizzying growth it generated over the last few years? Probably not. Nonetheless, I think this stock could be a big winner for investors who buy shares while they're down nearly 30% from the previous high. The Trade Desk's(TTD1.81%)shares have been absolutely clobbered this year, plunging more than 50%. Macroeconomic challenges haven't been the only issue for the adtech leader, though. The Trade Desk reported lower-than-expected revenue in its fourth-quarter results, something the company has rarely done. I don't expect an immediate turnaround. The Trade Desk's management acknowledged they had some things to fix, including reorganizing some internal teams. However, I remain bullish about this company's long-term prospects. The open internet advertising market totals over $935 billion and continues to expand. Connected TV is growing, especially ad-supported models. Roughly two-thirds of ad spending is outside the U.S., while around 88% of The Trade Desk's ad revenue comes from the U.S. I think The Trade Desk is well positioned to capitalize on its opportunities and return to its winning ways for investors. Unlike the other growth stocks on the list,Vertex Pharmaceuticals'(VRTX0.40%)share price hasn't declined in 2025. Instead, the biotech stock has skyrocketed 26% year to date. I suspect Vertex has more room to run. The company has three new products on the market. Gene-editing therapy Casgevy is beginning to pick up momentum after winning U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for treating sickle cell disease in late 2023 and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in early 2024. Alyftrek won FDA approval for treating cystic fibrosis in December 2024, and the FDA gave a thumbs-up to non-opioid pain drug Journavx in January 2025. I expect all three of these drugs to become huge blockbusters for Vertex. The company's pipeline could produce even more winners in the coming years, with late-stage programs, including two candidates targeting kidney diseases and a potential cure for severe type 1 diabetes. I firmly believe that investors who buy Vertex Pharmaceuticals stock in May and \"go away\" for 10 years will enjoy market-beating returns.",

        "header": "3 Semiconductor Stocks That Could Help Make You a Fortune",
        "content": "Many semiconductor stocks slumped this year as President Donald Trump's tariffs, the escalating trade wars, and fears of a recession cast dark clouds over the booming sector. However, that pullback has also been creating attractive buying opportunities for investors who expect the semiconductor market to continue growing over the next few decades. Below, I'll take a look at three of those stocks:TSMC(TSM3.68%),ASML(ASML3.48%), andArm Holdings(ARM6.88%). All of these companies provide crucial technologies for the chipmaking industry and will likely flourish as the expandingcloudand artificial intelligence (AI) markets drive the top chipmakers to produce even more advanced chips. That's why the stocks could be great ways for investors to make a fortune over the long term -- as long as they can tune out the near-term noise. Image source: Getty Images. TSMC is the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. Most of the top chipmakers -- includingNvidia,AMD,Qualcomm, andApple-- rely on TSMC's foundries to produce their smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips. Its closest foundry competitors are Samsung andIntel, but neither can match the size and density of TSMC's chips. In its latest quarter, TSMC generated 59% of its revenue from the high-performance computing (HPC) market, which includes Nvidia's AI graphics processing units (GPUs), and another 28% came from the smartphone market. The growth of its HPC business has been offsetting the cyclical softness of the smartphone market. As for its processes, TSMC generated 58% of its revenue from its smallest 5-nanometer (nm) and 3nm nodes during the quarter and will ramp up the production of its smallest 2nm chips in the second half of this year. TSMC remains the linchpin and bellwether of thesemiconductor industry, and it's a straightforward way to profit from that market's long-term growth. Its commitment to only producing its most advanced chips in Taiwan exposes it to some geopolitical risks, but it's been spreading out its manufacturing facilities across the U.S., Europe, and even mainland China. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect TSMC's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and 22%, respectively. Its stock looks like a bargain, relative to its growth potential, at 15 times forward earnings, and could easily command a higher valuation once the semiconductor market stabilizes again. ASML is the largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which TSMC, Samsung, and Intel all use to manufacture their most advanced chips at their foundries. ASML's current-generation \"low-NA\" EUV systems can produce chips as small as 2nm. Its newest \"high-NA\" EUV systems will be used to manufacture even smaller chips. ASML's dominance in this crucial technology gives it nearly unlimited pricing power and an impenetrable moat. Its low-NA EUV systems cost about $180 million each, while its high-NA EUV systems cost around $380 million. Those massive systems require multiple planes to ship and are assembled on-site at the foundries. ASML's growth slowed in 2024 as the company grappled with tighter export curbs against China -- where it's banned from selling its EUV systems, as well as some of its older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems -- and uneven spending from some of the top foundries. But from 2024 to 2027, analysts expect the company's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 12% and 19%, respectively. ASML's stock trades at a reasonable 25 times forward earnings and will continue growing, as long as chipmakers keep developing smaller and denser chips to support more sophisticated computing applications. Arm designs power-efficient CPUs that consume less power than the x86 CPUs produced by Intel and AMD for PCs and servers. That lower power consumption made Arm CPUs better suited for smartphones, tablets, Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets, and connected vehicles. It's even being used in some notebook computers and servers. Arm licenses those designs to leading mobile chipmakers like Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple. Its chip designs are now used in about 99% of the world's smartphones, and a lot of its recent growth was driven by the market's robust demand for its AI-optimized Armv9 designs. Arm didn't initially produce any of its own chips, but earlier this year, announced it would start developing its own first-party chips and outsource production to TSMC. That move would turn Arm into a competitor to some of its biggest clients but could also easily undercut the competition because it wouldn't need to pay any licensing fees for its own designs. Its first-party brand recognition could also make it more appealing than third-party chips among OEMs. From fiscal 2024 (which ended last March) to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Arm's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 23% and 81%, respectively. It isn't cheap at 55 times forward adjusted earnings but still has plenty of room to expand as more companies prioritize power-efficient designs over raw processing power.",

        "content": "One of the most popular ways to invest in the stock market today is to buy a simpleS&P 500exchange-traded fund (ETF). TheVanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO1.44%), for example, added $117.4 billion in net new assets last year, shattering the previous single-year record for inflows into a single ETF of $51 billion. The attraction is straightforward. The S&P 500 represents a diverse range of the biggest companies in the market. And since the index is the most often used benchmark for the stock market's performance, index investors don't need to worry about underperforming \"the market.\" Over the last few years, the S&P 500's returns have been driven by a handful of spectacular stocks benefiting from growing spending and excitement around artificial intelligence (AI). If you own the Vanguard ETF or any other S&P 500 index fund, you own a good chunk of names likeNvidia,Microsoft,Alphabet, and others leading AI forward. While many areconcerned about how tech-heavy the S&P 500 has become, the truth is S&P 500 index fund investors are missing out on one of the most important AI stocks of all. But investors have a great opportunity to add this semiconductor giant to their portfolio with a strategic stock purchase right now. Image source: Getty Images. There are several criteria for potential inclusion in the S&P 500, but two of the most important are: For the most part, companies meeting those criteria are eligible for inclusion in the index as long as they're in the top 500 or so companies bymarket caplisted on U.S. exchanges. That leaves a lot of great foreign companies out of the index, though. That includesTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM3.68%), or TSMC. The Taiwan-based company is the largest chip manufacturer, or foundry, in the world. And it provides some of the most essential foundations for the advancement of AI. Here's why every investor focused on technology stocks needs it in their portfolio. TSMC has built a substantial technology lead over its closest competitors. It's one of only three manufacturers capable of producing chips meeting 3 nm standards, and its processes typically deliver better power and performance than comparable chips from other manufacturers. When it comes to building AI accelerator chips fortrainingandinference, delivering powerful chips that use as little energy as possible is essential. Real estate and power consumption are meaningful constraints that are best optimized by using chips produced by TSMC. That's why the Taiwanese company has seen demand for its most advanced chips soar over the last two years. Sales climbed 35% last quarter, and management maintained its outlook for mid-20% revenue growth. Advanced 5 nm and 3 nm nodes accounted for 58% of total revenue last quarter, as high-performance computing (AI chips) offsets some weakness in smartphone chip manufacturing. TSMC has built a substantial moat that makes it hard for competing foundries to eat into its growing market share. It has the most advanced manufacturing capabilities in the world, which attracts chip designers like Nvidia andApplelooking to get TSMC's technology into their products. That gives it substantial capital to invest in expanding its production capabilities and more money to invest in research and development. As a result, it's able to push its technology forward at a faster rate than competitors, and it has the scale to implement that advanced technology for its biggest customers. That lead will expand over the next few years, as TSMC starts volume production of its 2 nm technology in the second half of this year. It's also investing a whopping $38 billion to $42 billion in capital expenditures this year to meet the growing demand for AI chips it sees coming down the road. That's a 34% increase at the midpoint of management's guidance from last year's spending. TSMC is also planning to spend $100 billion over the next few years building manufacturing capacity in the United States. While TSMC shares soared 90% in 2024, the shares have come down more than 20% from their all-time high reached earlier this year. That makes right now a great opportunity to buy shares of the stock. Shares currently trade for less than 19 times the analysts' consensus estimate for 2025 earnings. That's well below the S&P 500's aggregate P/E ratio and among the lowest of the biggestAI stocksin the market. What makes that valuation even more appealing is management's reaffirmed outlook for revenue growth in the mid-20% range this year while maintaining its strong operating margin. Over the long run, management expects average annual revenue growth of more than 20% over the next five years while it maintains its gross margin above 53% (versus 59% last quarter). Note, margins typically take a hit as TSMC ramps up production of a new process as it plans to do over the next few years. There are some risks to TSMC. Particularly geopolitical risks. That's come to the forefront recently as theTrump administration is imposing tariffson most imports. That could drive up the cost of semiconductors for TSMC's biggest customers, reducing demand for their end products, and by extension TSMC's manufacturing services. That's particularly notable for TSMC since it must invest significant capital ahead of demand in order to be able to meet customers' needs. But given TSMC's technological lead and the importance of AI advancements to the biggest companies in the world, the company's margins should remain relatively stable. Management said during its April earnings call that it hasn't seen any changes in its customers so far. If you invest exclusively in an S&P 500 index fund, you might consider adding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to your portfolio. Based on its market cap, it would account for roughly 1.8% of the index if it were included. It's simple enough to carve out a small portion of your portfolio for TSMC and buy a few shares at the current bargain price being offered.",

        "content": "For the last two and a half years, the technology sector has witnessed an abnormal level of interest compared to other industries. By no stretch of the imagination, this dynamic is connected to unrelenting euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). What's interesting, however, is that the AI theme can largely be traced to asmall concentration of megacap stocks. Known as the \"Magnificent Seven,\"Apple,Microsoft,Nvidia(NVDA2.33%),Alphabet,Amazon,Meta Platforms, andTeslaare some of the most widely held stocks in theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)right now. As of May 1, Nvidia is thethird-largest company in the worldas measured by market cap -- sitting behind just Apple and Microsoft. Let's explore some of the factors that have influenced Nvidia's valuation throughout 2025. More importantly, I'll detail what catalysts could fuel Nvidia to become the most valuable company in the world by year-end. It's been a tumultuous year for Nvidia. As of this writing, the stock has plummeted by 15% -- more than triple the declines seen in the S&P 500. To quantify just how much value Nvidia has lost, consider the company's current market cap is nearly$1 trillion lowerthan peak levels seen in January.  NVDA Market Capdata byYCharts The first large-scale sell-off in Nvidia stock happened earlier this year, after a Chinese start-up calledDeepSeekemerged out of nowhere. DeepSeek claimed that it built an AI platform on par with many leading models built here in the U.S., but was able to do so by using older Nvidia architectures. For a brief period, investors started to question what demand would look like for Nvidia's next-generation chipsets. After several weeks of investigative reporting from Wall Street analysts and technology journalists, it began to emerge thatthere was likely more to DeepSeek's initial assertions. The current sell-off in Nvidia revolves around a nasty storm related to new tariff policies. More specifically, ongoing tension between the U.S. and China has some investors seriously worrying aboutNvidia's potential in the Chinese marketas it now battles a much tougher landscape featuring capable competition from Huawei. Image source: Getty Images. I see Nvidia as a more critical player to the overall development of AI-powered services compared to Apple and Microsoft. I think both Apple and Microsoft will face more scrutiny from investors in coming quarters. Demand for iPhones in the Chinese market and here domestically could take a toll thanks to mounting pressures surrounding the ongoing tariff situation. Meanwhile, Microsoft's primary catalyst of cloud computing services faces a tough competitive landscape from Google and Amazon. Now that May has arrived, investors are set to receive a number of updates as many of the world's leading technology companies report earnings for the first calendar quarter of 2025. As of closing bell on April 30, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet -- each of which works closely with Nvidia -- have reported earnings. During Alphabet's first-quarter call, management reaffirmed prior guidance to spend$75 billion in capital expenditures(capex) this year. In addition, Microsoft doubled down on its own capex plans for the second half of the year whileMeta actually increased its prior guidance. These are important themes to understand. If Nvidia's largest customers were not seeing robust demand for their own AI services, then it's likely they would pull back their infrastructure budgets. However, despite a turbulent macroeconomic environment, big tech appears to be confident in the long-run potential of the AI revolution -- hence, they remain committed to spending tens of billions on data centers, servers, chips, networking equipment, and more. To me, these dynamics support the idea that Nvidia should remain a top vendor as tech giants continue building their AI infrastructure. Moreover, I think Nvidia is best positioned among the Magnificent Seven to benefit from AI capex tailwinds. For these reasons, I think Nvidia should witness strong demand for its GPUs and various other services throughout the second half of the year. I am optimistic that investor confidence will begin to sway in Nvidia's favor again -- propelling the company to a much higher valuation than where it is today and surpassing that of its Magnificent Seven peers.",

        "content": "The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results before the opening bell Wednesday, and analysts are largely bullish on the media and entertainment giant's stock. Five of the seven analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who cover Disney rate the stock as a \"buy,\" while the other two dub it a \"hold.\" Their average price target is $120, a nearly 30% premium to the stock's closing level Friday, suggesting analysts think shares will reverse their roughly 19% decline since the end of February. The conglomerate is expected to report second-quarter revenue of $23.17 billion, up 5% year-over-year, while adjusted earnings per share are expected to have declined by a penny to $1.20. UBS analysts recently reiterated their \"buy\" rating in a note previewing Disney's earnings, but trimmed their price target to $105 from $130. The analysts said they expect the firm's second quarter to \"reflect resilient demand across the parks, initial upside from the new cruise ship and solid sports advertising,\" but see \"recession risk\" in the second half of the fiscal year that could hit advertising revenue and park visits. Last quarter, Disney's revenue and profit topped estimates, but it reported a slight drop in Disney+ subscribers to 124.6 million, and said it expected another \"modest decline\" in the second quarter. Visible Alpha consensus calls for 123.7 million Disney+ subscribers at the end of the second quarter.",

        "header": "Is The Damage to the Dollar's Status Permanent?",
        "content": "As investors recover from a volatile month of tariff headlines, the lingering question on Wall Street is how much the U.S. dollar\u2019s status as the pre-eminent global currency has weakened. \u201cKing Dollar\u201d is unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon given the lack of a reasonable alternative, analysts say. The dollar remains the most widely used currency in global trade, a role it\u2019s held since the aftermath of World War II, and past efforts to replace it have sputtered. Even so, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies andattacks on the Federal Reservehave sown doubts in global financial markets, fracturing that dominance. While he\u2019s since eased up on both counts and U.S. stock markets havesomewhat recovered, the doubts among global investors don\u2019t seem to be fully going away. \u201cIt is hard to put the genie back in the bottle once such concerns are raised,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategist Vishwanath Tirupattur wrote in a note to clients last week. However, he wrote, \u201cpractical realities\u201d will make it difficult to massively shift the dollar\u2019s role. Since the dollar is integral to global trade, countries and their central banks hold large amounts of dollars in their coffers. The U.S. dollar made up about 57% of foreign exchange reserves last year, according to the International Monetary Fund, compared to 20% for the Euro, 6% for the Japanese yen and 5% for the Pound sterling. The U.S. dollar was involved in about 90% of transactions in 2022 in the market where investors and companies trade foreign currencies, according to the Bank for International Settlements. There is \u201creally no alternative\u201d to the dollar, said Brent Coggins, chief investment officer at Triad Wealth Partners in Kansas. The Euro is \u201cvery fragmented,\u201d China\u2019s currency doesn\u2019t float freely in markets and the yen \u201cdoesn\u2019t have scale\u201d to compete, he said. Dollar dominance has long irked some countries\u2014and not just those subject to U.S. sanctions such as Russia or Iran. In the 1960s, a French official said the dollar\u2019s reign gives the United States an \u201cexorbitant privilege,\u201d a moniker that\u2019s stuck ever since. More recently, the BRICS countries\u2014which include Brazil, Russia, India, and China\u2014have reportedly dropped the idea of developing a common currency even as they seek to bolster their local currencies in trading arrangements rather than the U.S. dollar.It was the latest victory for the U.S. dollar, which Coggins noted has thus far outlived a series of would-be alternatives. \u201cEven though it\u2019s going through a disruption right now and people are challenging it, it\u2019s dealt with challenges before, and it\u2019s always come out ahead,\u201d Coggins said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see this being any different.\u201d Despite its historical dominance, the dollar is up against a broader \u201cconfidence crisis\u201d in U.S. assets, said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at the European firm Pictet Asset Management. Investors are questioning whether U.S. Treasury bonds\u2014which the government issues to finance its deficits\u2014are still the \u201csafe haven\u201d they used to be. They\u2019re also shedding some of their holdings in U.S. stocks, with tech firms getting hit hard and worries over the U.S. economy clouding the outlook for others. The selling of U.S. dollar assets has pressured the dollar, which hasweakened8% this year against a basket of foreign currencies. Some analysts think the worst of it may be over. The dollar sell-off was \u201catypical and likely temporary,\u201d Wells Fargo international economist Nick Bennenbroek wrote in a research note. While Sai said the U.S. financial markets and \u201cabsolutely exceptional companies\u201d still warrant investment, global asset managers like Pictet are rethinking their heavy U.S. exposures and weighing alternatives. Some are buying gold, which is hittingrecord highs. German bonds are also a popular option for those seeking a safe haven.Emerging markets are also seeing inflows. Stocks closer to home are becoming a more attractive option as U.S. uncertainty rises, Sai said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies have \u201cincentivized capital to stay domestic.\u201d When looking to deploy cash, Sai said he\u2019s weighing assets in Europe and the U.K. \u201ca little bit more than I would have last year.\u201d However, that could turn around, analysts said. \u201cWe certainly understand why financial markets may be interested in reallocating away from U.S. assets at this particular time, but we ultimately think this shift is tactical rather than a fundamental reassessment of U.S. assets,\u201d Bennenbroek wrote.",

        "content": "If you've inherited some money\u2014even if it isn't a lot\u2014congratulations! You could just go out and spend it, of course. Or you could invest it in something more meaningful to you. Before doing anything with the money, give yourself a little time to regroup.Inheriting money\u2014even a modest sum\u2014can bring up emotional decisions, especially if it came from someone close to you. Taking a pause can help you make choices that align with your long-term goals. Here are five simple steps to make a modest inheritance go the farthest. Take a moment to assess your financial picture and resist the urge to spend impulsively. A calm, thoughtful approach will help you make smarter choices. Rather than an everyday bank account, look for one that will at least earn you someinterest. Mari Adam, a certified financial planner in Boca Raton, Fla., says a money market account at a discountbrokerage firmcan be ideal for that purpose. Another possibility is a high-yield savings account at an online bank. They're both currently paying about 4%. Inheritances are generally tax-free to the recipient. However, as Adam points out, that can depend on how the inheritance comes to you. If it's simply cash, you most likely don't have to worry about taxes. If you're the beneficiary of someone'sindividual retirement account (IRA), however, you are subject to adifferent set of tax rules. You may want to earmark the money for a future goal, such as adown paymenton a home, your own or a child's education, or your retirement. Or, you might want to put it to use right away, such as paying down any high-interestcredit card debtyou've been carrying. If you don't really need the money for more serious purposes, don't hesitate to use it for something you've always dreamed of but could never afford\u2014a special vacation trip, for example. \"Someone felt enough of you to give you this gift,\" Adam says. \"They wanted you to enjoy it.\" If your plan for the money is to buy a new car a year from now, you will want to invest it moreconservativelythan if it's for along-termgoal, such as your retirement in 20, 30, or 40 years. In the former case, you might just leave it in the money market or high-yield savings account; in the latter case, you'll have more options for potentially higher returns, such as astock index mutual fund. If you've inherited a little money, what you do with it next is up to you. You can spend it, save it for the time being, or invest it for the long haul. Whatever you end up doing, try to give it some thought before you act because once the money's gone, it's gone. And a modest inheritance can go pretty fast.",

        "header": "Is Now the Time to Buy Beaten-Down AI Stocks?",
        "content": "Investors rushed to get in on artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past two years as it became clear that AI might be the next big thing. The idea was that this newish technology could join the ranks of electricity or the internet, revolutionizing our daily lives and a whole lot more. As a result, companies such as AI chip giantNvidia(NVDA2.33%)and AI-driven software companyPalantir Technologiessaw their stock prices soar -- these two surged 171% and 340%, respectively, last year. But recently, the excitement has turned to concern about what's ahead. Early last month, President Donald Trump announced a detailed plan for tariffs on imports, and stocks -- particularly tech and AI players -- sank. Though the president paused the tariffs for a 90-day negotiation period and even temporarily halted tariffs on electronics products, the issue remains a risk for U.S. companies. The concern is that the tariffs will result in higher prices, hurting both the U.S. consumer and companies, particularly those, such as tech players, that heavily import parts and finished products. Amid these fears, theNasdaq Compositecrashed into bear territory. Though it's recovered from its low point, many AI stocks remain down for the year. And many are trading at reasonable and even bargain valuations. Does this mean now is the time to buy beaten-down AI stocks? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. So, first, let's consider the tariff situation. At the moment, tech companies don't face tariffs because Trump has exempted them. This means U.S. tech players don't have to pay the 145% tariff that Trump imposed on China when importing electronics items from that country. (The U.S. excluded China from its pause on tariffs.) The Trump administration is now studying what level might be appropriate for electronics and will soon announce a tariff that will apply specifically to imported electronics parts and finished products. Meanwhile, companies are making an effort to reorganize their manufacturing processes to minimize potential tariff impact. For example, Nvidia announced a majormove to build AI infrastructurein the U.S., andApplesaid it's moving production of its iPhones and other products for the U.S. away from China -- the country most impacted by Trump's tariffs -- to India and Vietnam. These investments by companies today may result in higher costs in the near term but should insulate them from significant tariff impact over the long run. It's also important to keep in mind that Trump's move to pause general tariffs and negotiate with countries and his decision to temporarily exempt electronics from tariffs offer us reason to be optimistic about the future. This shows a certain degree of flexibility and the will to impose tariffs without damaging the earnings of U.S. companies. So, when the U.S. announces trade deals with various countries and an eventual tariff level for electronics, it's possible that the impact on U.S. companies will be much less than originally expected. If this happens, stocks could soar from current levels. I wouldn't expect tariffs to be as high as the initial levels announced before the pause, but the risk is that they -- and an eventual electronics tariff -- would still be high enough to disturb earnings and economic growth. In this scenario, stocks may take a lot longer to recover. Let's get back to our question: Considering the uncertainty about tariffs ahead, is now really the time to buy beaten-down AI stocks? A look at the \"Magnificent Seven\" technology stocks that led market gains last year shows four of them trading for less than 30xforward earnings estimates. AndAlphabetlooks dirt cheap at only 17x forward earnings.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio. What happens next depends on tariff news. If it's better than expected, these and other AI stocks could climb, lifting valuations. However, as mentioned, if tariffs seem high, these stocks could fall further. Even though I'm more inclined to say good news may still be ahead, if you're betting on the short term, risk remains. But don't worry. Here's some good news: You don't have to bet on the short term. Instead, bet on stocks over the long term, and the picture changes in a positive manner. Strong AI companies, such as Nvidia or Alphabet, are likely to win over a number of years thanks to their smart investments and innovation today, even if their shares stagnate or fall at certain points in the near term. It's impossible to time the market and scoop up a stock at its very lowest, but today, prices of many AI players have reached bargain levels considering their long-term prospects. And that means if you buy at these levels, you could score a major win over time, even if stocks slip further in the coming weeks or months. That's why it's a great idea to seize the opportunity and get in on some of the market's top AI stocks right now.",

        "content": "The launch of ChatGPT on Nov. 30, 2022 represented one of the leading catalysts that sparked the revolution around artificial intelligence (AI). Since that date, shares of semiconductor stockNvidiahave soared an astronomical 550%, transforming the company to a multitrillion-dollar enterprise in the process. While semiconductor chips should remain an integral component of AI development, investors want to identify new growth opportunities beyond Nvidia. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM3.68%)is another company that looks well-positioned to dominate the AI chip arena over the next decade. Its growth prospects and valuation trends support the case for why Taiwan Semi is my top choice in the chip space right now. Chances are you're familiar with names like Nvidia,Advanced Micro Devices, andBroadcomwhen it comes to advanced chipsets and data center infrastructure used for building AI applications. What you may not be so familiar with, however, is the role Taiwan Semi plays in the background. Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom,OpenAI,Amazon,Qualcomm, and many others rely on the fabrication processes of TSMC to help manufacture their chips and integrated systems products. In other words, Taiwan Semi brings the engineering prowess from AI's biggest players to life. Image source: Getty Images. In 2024, TSMC generated $88.3 billion in sales and $6.81 in earnings per share. Per the consensus estimates below, Wall Street is expecting the company's top line to continue growing rapidly over the next couple of years while maintaining healthy profitability too.  Data byYCharts. AI in the semiconductor market is expected reach a market size of $233 billion by 2034, according to Precedence Research. Considering thatTSMC already holds over 60% of the foundry market, combined with its long roster of industry-leading chip designers as customers and the rise ofcustom siliconchipsets, Taiwan Semi is in a great position to achieve or even surpass the financial estimates illustrated above. As of this writing, Taiwan Semi trades at aprice-to-earnings ratio(P/E) of 21. This is in line with its 10-year average multiple.  Data byYCharts. But TSMC's valuation has compressed significantly over the last few months with the primary cause being the ongoing uncertainty around newtariff and trade policiesfrom the U.S. Although it's hard to predict when there will be any relief from ongoing trade negotiations, I tend to be in the camp that believes growth stocks are oversold right now. From a macro point of view, tariffs can change at any point, and the current policies aren't going to last forever. Investors are overstating the impact tariffs might have on TSMC's business in the short term while underestimating how bright the company's long-term opportunity is. Unlike an investment in Nvidia, buying TSMC stock more or less serves as a long-run bet on overall chip demand andAI infrastructurespending. In other words, regardless of which company's chips or data center equipment are experiencing the most demand -- TSMC stands to benefit. That puts the company in the middle of a budding, generational megatrend. Taiwan Semi's growth prospects are the best they've been in at least the last decade, and yet, the company's valuation is unchanged from its 10-year average and even represents a discount to theS&P 500index. Put it all together, and you have a clear case for why Taiwan Semi is the top chip stock to own for the next decade.",

        "content": "While everyone\u2019s focused on Nvidia as the most overvalued stock of this cycle, the real bubble is Palantir.  Palantir is sitting at a price to sales ratio of 100, making it the most expensive large cap stock ever on a revenue basis. At an almost $300 billion market cap with 34% revenue growth and less than $3B in sales for all of 2024, the stock\u2019s valuation is completely disconnected from its fundamentals.  Here's a table of the most overvalued large cap stocks I could find throughout history, sorted by date of the peak P/S ratio along with P/E a year later and change in revenue, EPS, and share price in the year following the peak valuation (I worked all weekend on this unfortunately):  https://preview.redd.it/s3lyvzswauye1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5dd317b75dac68b696e235c17a97437175c9c33  **Nvidia**  Nvidia\u2019s valuation was insane and the growth was even crazier. That was a once in lifetime growth story, and PLTR is somehow priced much higher.  **Tesla**  Tesla\u2019s 1,400 P/E in 2021 looks insane but EPS exploded the next year and the valuation normalized. Palantir doesn\u2019t have anywhere close to that growth coming.  **Cisco**  Cisco is a better comparison. It crashed over 80% during the dotcom bubble pop and never returned to those levels. PLTR is more expensive with weaker growth and is somehow projected for less revenue growth than Cisco saw throughout that 80% stock decline.  **Zoom**  The closest comparison is Zoom, which peaked with a P/S of 106 in late 2020. Zoom went on to grow revenue at 170% and EPS at 319% over the next year. Despite that insane growth (much higher than what Palantir is projected to do), the stock still dropped 45% in that time, then bottomed nearly 90% from its highs. Palantir is trading at a similar valuation with significantly less growth. 2021 was also a euphoric market year, while we\u2019re at the beginning of a market-wide bubble pop.  Palantir is more expensive than Zoom at its peak valuation (at the beginning of one of the most euphoric market periods we\u2019ve ever seen) with much less projected growth. It is also trading far above Nvidia\u2019s peak multiples despite Nvidia growing more than 6x faster on revenue and 4x faster on EPS.  **Conspiracies**  Palantir\u2019s surge is driven by AI hype and retail euphoria. I saw bulls on Twitter calling for the stock to 10x in five years which is ridiculous. Some of the hype is also based on a weird conspiracy that Trump is going to pump it or Peter Thiel is going to enslave us all with AI. I have no idea where that comes from and I\u2019m 99% sure that everyone blindly parroting these claims has no idea what Palantir actually does either.  Every stock in the table above showed strong revenue and earnings growth in the 12 months after their peak valuation. That didn\u2019t stop the crashes. Valuations eventually matter. Palantir will keep growing but not anywhere near fast enough to justify this kind of multiple.  tl;dr: Palantir is talked about like the next Nvidia, but it\u2019s the next Cisco or Zoom. I have no idea how this stock is above $20 a share.",
