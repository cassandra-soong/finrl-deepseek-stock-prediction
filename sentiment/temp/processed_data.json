        "content": "By Nell Mackenzie and Johann M Cherian LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Global markets climbed on Monday and the euro rallied after U.S. President Donald Trump kicked his threat to slap 50% tariffs on European Union goods into July, marking another temporary trade policy reprieve. MSCI's broadest index of world shares rose 0.2%. The pan-European stocks index, last up 1%, recovered to where it was trading before Trump on Friday unexpectedly called for 50% tariffs on European goods, saying negotiations with the region had become too sluggish. On Sunday, Trump reversed tack, pushing the deadline for tariffs to July 9 from June 1, after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the 27-nation bloc needed more time to produce a deal. Trump's latest policy moves were a reminder to investors how quickly circumstances could change, and analysts have pointed out that investors are shifting their money out of U.S. markets to Europe and Asia as they price in a possible U.S. recession and a consequent global slowdown. Last Friday's comments were a reminder of Trump and his administration\u2019s unpredictable and seemingly incoherent policies and decision-making, Commerzbank said in a note. \"Now, a really toxic cocktail is mixed for the U.S. consisting of (1) rising risk premium to hold U.S. assets, (2) global investors' move towards increased portfolio diversification, and (3) an increased homeland focus,\" said a note from SEB Research adding that they expected the dollar to lose value while U.S. interest rates could rise further. EURO GAINS The dollar fell 0.1% against a basket of currencies on Monday. The euro appreciated 0.24% to $1.1382 - its highest since late April, while the pound ticked almost 0.2% upwards to 1.3560. \"It still is largely a 'sell dollar story',\" said Christopher Wong, currency strategist at OCBC. \"The policy unpredictability surrounding Trump's tariffs and of course, the erosion of the U.S. exceptionalism, this could potentially still undermine sentiment and the confidence in the medium term.\" Trading volumes on Monday are expected to be thinner than usual, given that markets in the United States and Britain are closed due to public holidays. Ballooning debt levels in developed economies were also brought back into focus following Moody's credit rating downgrade of the United States and weak debt auctions in the U.S. and Japan last week. Inflation reports come from Japan and Germany later this week, along with price data on U.S. goods and services. China and Hong Kong stocks closed lower on Monday as automobile shares slid on price war concerns and Apple suppliers dropped on potential U.S. tariffs. At the close, the Shanghai Composite index weakened 0.1% while the blue-chip CSI300 index dropped 0.6%. In Japan, Nikkei 225 closed 1% higher, its sharpest one-day advance in almost two weeks, after Trump appeared to give his blessing to Nippon Steel's takeover of U.S. Steel. Japanese government bonds also rallied, following a dramatic week in which super-long yields hit record levels last week. Super-long Japanese bonds will be in focus, with inflation data expected later in the week as investors try to gauge the Bank of Japan's monetary policy outlook. On the commodities front, Brent and U.S. crude prices traded 12 and 6 cents higher, respectively to $64.90 and $61.29, while gold eased from a two-week high to $3,328 an ounce.

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia Will Underwhelm Wall Street on May 28",
        "content": "May has been a month of monster news events. It began withBerkshire Hathaway'sWarren Buffett announcing plans to step down as CEO by the end of the year. This was followed just days later by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on interest rates. All the while, earnings season rolled on and President Trump's administration announced numerous changes to tariff and trade policy. But the pinnacle of news events, in the eyes of investors, might just beNvidia's(NVDA-1.02%)fiscal 2026 first-quarter operating results, which are scheduled for release following the closing bell on May 28. However, this highly anticipated event may turn out to be a dud for Wall Street'sartificial intelligence (AI)champion. Image source: Getty Images. For more than two years, AI has been the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street. The ability to empower software and systems to make split-second decisions without human intervention, as well as learn over time, is a game-changer than has relevancy to virtually all industries around the globe. Nvidia finds itself at the center of the evolution of the AI movement. Its Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) and successor Blackwell GPUhave enjoyed near-monopoly share status in enterprise AI-accelerated data centers. No external competitors have come particularly close to surpassing the compute potential of Nvidia's hardware. Wall Street's AI darling has also benefited from ongoing AI-GPU scarcity. Nvidia isn't lacking for orders -- it's lacking for the physical GPUs to fulfill all the orders it has. When demand for a good or service outpaces its supply, the price for said good or service will rise until demand tapers. According to online technology-focused publication Tom's Hardware,Nvidia's Hopper chip was priced at a 100% to 300% premiumtoAdvanced Micro Devices'(AMD-0.25%)Instinct AI-accelerating chips early last year. The advantage of premium pricing power can be seen in Nvidia's gross margin. Before the AI revolution took shape, Nvidia's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin commonly vacillated between 55% and 65%. In the fiscal first quarter of 2025 (ended April 28, 2024), it peaked at 78.4%. Investors flock to Nvidia because of its innovative prowess, as well.CEO Jensen Huang is aggressively investing in the company's AI futureand aiming to bring a new AI-GPU to market on an annual basis. Following the Hopper and Blackwell are the Blackwell Ultra AI platform, Vera Rubin, and Vera Rubin Ultra. The latter three are penned for their debuts in the second-half of 2025, second-half of 2026, and second-half of 2027, respectively. If Nvidia can hold to these innovation timelines, it'll have no trouble maintaining its compute advantage. Lastly, Nvidia delivered where it counts. After reporting $27 billion in full-year sales in fiscal 2023, its revenue skyrocketed to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025. In the current fiscal year, the consensus of nearly five-dozen analysts is almost $200 billion in sales. Despite all of this working in Nvidia's favor, the table is set for Wall Street's AI icon to underwhelm on May 28. Image source: Getty Images. Between the end of 2022 and present day, Nvidia has catapulted from a somewhat important tech stock with a $360 billion market cap to arguably the most-important tech company on the planet with a $3.3 trillion market valuation. Never in history has a megacap company added $3 trillion in market cap so quickly -- and there's absolutely no room for error. Nvidia topping consensus sales and profit expectations for the fiscal first quarter wouldn't be a surprise given the company has surpassed consensus earnings per share for nine consecutive quarters. Butthere's more to Nvidia's headline numbers than meets the eye. For instance, it's a certainty that competition is picking up from all angles. AMD and China-based Huawei are developing and introducing next-gen AI-GPUs that have the potential to directly compete with Nvidia. Butit's not the external competition that Nvidia and its shareholders should be worried about. It's the members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" many of which are Nvidia's top customers by net sales, which are developing AI-GPUs and solutions to internally use in their data centers. Even if this internally developed hardware is inferior to the Hopper and Blackwell in compute potential, these chips will be considerably cheaper and more accessible (i.e., they're not backlogged). The problem internal development presents is that it reduces AI-GPU scarcity for the businesses that spend the most on AI infrastructure. In simpler terms, it offers fewer future opportunities for Nvidia's GPUs to win valuable AI-data center space.  Nvidia's GAAP gross margin is forecast to decline to 70.6% (+/- 50 basis points) for its fiscal 2026 first quarter.NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. We've already begun to see the impact of growing internal competition on Nvidia's GAAPgross margin. As you can see in the chart above, Nvidia's GAAP gross margin peaked at 78.4% in the fiscal first quarter one year ago. It then fell to 75.1% in Q2 2025, 74.6% in Q3 2025, 73% in Q4 2025, and isforecast to come in at 70.6% (+/- 50 basis points) in Q1 2026. What this persistent margin decline tells us is thatNvidia is losing what's been its biggest competitive advantage: its pricing power. As AI-GPU scarcity diminishes over time, Nvidia's gross margin should fall. It's the company's GAAP gross margin, along with the forecast for fiscal Q2's GAAP gross margin, that can cause Nvidia stock to underwhelm on May 28. It's also not clear if Nvidia's accelerated innovation timeline that involves bringing a new GPU to market annually will help or hinder its operations. Though innovation will assist Nvidia in retaining its compute lead, it could quickly depreciate Hopper GPUs and cause future buyers to question when they want to upgrade and how much they want to spend on AI infrastructure. Finally,there's the ongoing overhang of historic precedent. Since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a truly game-changing innovation or technology that's escaped a bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors continually overshoot on their estimates of how quickly a game-changing technology will gain utility or enjoy widespread adoption. Though we've witnessed sizable AI investments from some of Wall Street's most-influential businesses, most companies haven't yet optimized their AI solutions and/or aren't generating a profit on their AI investments. This implies we're careening toward yet another next-big-thing innovation bubble-bursting event. While Nvidia has proved me wrong before, the table appears set for an underwhelming performance.",

        "content": "Donor-advised funds (DAFs) can be a great way for you toreach your philanthropic goals. These funds are administered by charities and handle large donations on behalf of individuals, families, or organizations. There are several things you need to consider beforechoosing the right DAF, including the sponsor, the fees, and the grantmaking abilities they offer. A donor-advised fund is a charitable tool often employed byhigh-net-worth individuals, but are available to philanthropic individuals. It works much like an investment account. You make (charitable) contributions, get an immediate tax benefit, and advise the fund on how the money is distributed. You can keep the fund open as long as you contribute or make recommendations, so your charitable giving can have a long-term positive impact in the community. This is one reason why DAFs are a popular way for people toenhance their charitable giving. According to Philanthropy Roundtable, roughly $55 billion in grants were facilitated through these funds in 2023, which are widely accessible to donors. But are they right for your financial plans? Talk to a financial advisor to be sure. But DAFs can be a great option if you want to make a long-term impact, appreciate the flexibility of deciding where your donations will go in the future, and want a simple way to manage your charitable giving, according to Marcos Segrera, wealth manager and principal at Evensky & Katz/Foldes, who suggests donating highly appreciated assets like stocks or real estate. \u201cDonating these can help youavoid capital gains taxeswhile still getting a deduction for their fair market value within certain limits,\u201d Segrera says, adding that you can also add cash to the fund. The payout rate for DAFs is the percentage of assets granted to charities each year. The average rate was 17.1% for community foundations and 25.4% for national charities from 2020 to 2022. Donations are irrevocable, which means the assets you donate cannot be reclaimed once the sponsoring organization takes them over.Since the legal ownership of your assets is turned over to the sponsor, Segrera says it\u2019s important to consider the following: Donor-advised fund sponsors can be national charitable arms, community foundations, public foundations, andnonprofit organizations. Each has its benefits and focus. For instance, a community foundation may focus on local and/or regional causes, while a national charitable arm may be affiliated with a financial services firm. Donor-advised funds may help you reach your charitable goals while giving you an immediate tax deduction, even if you want to do so anonymously. But do your research before you commit\u2014the same way you would with any other investment. Consider sitting down with a financial professional to discuss your charitable goals and see if a DAF fits into your financial situation.",

        "content": "Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pause as growing concerns about the fiscal deficit have sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump is once again threatening to escalate tariffs.    On Friday, Trump threatened to place a direct 25% tariff on Apple products not made in the US while also warning he'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (\\^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (\\^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (\\^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week.    In the week ahead, updates on the trade war and Trump's pending tax bill will remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention.    The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.    Tariff escalation  President Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (\\^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (\\^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February.    But the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries, the trade policy whipsaw in markets is far from over.    \"Safe to say for the time being we\u2019ve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,\" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.\"    Friday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years.    This played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (\\^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&P 500's 2.6% decline.    The AI leader reports  Nvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.    Given Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns.    Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&P 500's gains.    Price check  Tariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week.    A fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.5% in April, down from the 2.6% seen in March. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior.",

The partnerships come as the Trump administration rolls back Biden-era semiconductor export rules. The Commerce Department has ended the \u201cAI diffusion\u201d restriction, which previously required special licenses to export advanced AI chips. The policy shift is designed to favor trusted allies while keeping U.S.-made technology away from geopolitical rivals like China, Fortune says.

Humain's rise signals a strategic redirection in the global AI ecosystem. While U.S.-based clients like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)) and Amazon still dominate Nvidia's distribution priorities, Fortune reports that Saudi Arabia now joins a short list of preferred global chip recipients, second only to the U.S. Meanwhile, China has been restricted to using Nvidia's downgraded H20 chips, designed to comply with U.S. export controls but lacking the full performance of Blackwell processors. \u201cChina is the big loser,\u201d Ives told Fortune, citing both the technology gap and increased trade complications as key disadvantages.

        "content": "Sequence of returns risk, which is the danger ofpoor investment returnsearly in retirement combined with the timing of withdrawals, can adversely impact how long your retirement funds will last. For high-net-worth (HNW) investors, this threatens not only their financial security but also their ability to leave a lasting legacy. Investors who experiencenegative investment returnsin their portfolios early in retirement may have reduced longevity of their retirement income. This is known as the sequence of returns risk. When retirees start withdrawing retirement funds during periods of market downturns, the value of their portfolios decreases quickly, leaving less capital available to recover when the markets begin improving. This can be particularly damaging to HNW investors who, while having a larger amount of assets, generally also have higher expenses and dreams of leaving a legacy with their wealth. Diversify your portfolio: Diversified investment portfolios can mitigate the impact of market downturns; while some assets may perform poorly, others may not lose as much value or may even appreciate. Ensure you have amix of asset classes: stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, etc. Have aflexible withdrawal strategy: Rather than relying on a fixed withdrawal schedule, such as taking out $1,000 every month, consider an approach that allows flexibility during market downturns\u2014for example, reducing withdrawals and relying on other sources of income. This keeps a larger amount of capital in your portfolios that can recover when the market reverses. Steve Branton, certified financial planner (CFP) and managing director at Wealthspire Advisors, suggests that \u201cAt certain predetermined trigger points (10% market correction, 20% bear market), consider reducing the monthly draw by a predetermined amount (like 10%) or have the option to pause entirely any discretionary withdrawals to avoid locking in losses and cutting more into principal during\u00a0a downturn. Instead, tap into cash reserves,ultra-short-term bonds, or money market funds to meet spending needs and allow the stock portion of the portfolio time to recover.\u201d Keep a cash reserve: Allowing yourself a cash cushion to rely on when the market drops, rather than taking out retirement income, will also help preserve capital. This will allow you to meet basic expenses, such as food, without requiring you to sell your assets at depressed values. Delay big expenses: When the market is volatile, it\u2019s best to delay large expenses, such as the purchase of a new car, until there is more predictability. For HNW individuals, passing on wealth to future heirs and preserving a legacy through charitable actions is often a financial goal. Sequences of returns can challenge these plans and need to be managed effectively. Incorporatinglegacy and estate planning strategies, such as creating trusts, tax-efficient donations, and using life insurance, can help achieve your legacy goals regardless of how the financial markets perform. In addition, Branton says, \u201cOptimize your asset allocation during a downturn by reallocating investments across taxable, tax-deferred (individual retirement accounts), and tax-free (Roth) account types to maximize long-term return over the course of retirement. For example, concentrate high-growth, tax-inefficient assets like real estate investment trusts in Roth IRAs.\u201d Branton also adds that \u201cRoth convertingduring declining markets can lock in lower tax costs on the future growth of the investments. Using the current sky-highestate tax exemption level(set to expire by year-end) could allow certain high-net-worth families to shift out of their estate more assets while valuations are temporarily depressed.\u201d A comfortable andfinancially secure retirementisn\u2019t just about amassing retirement funds. It\u2019s also about how and when you use those retirement funds. Market timing combined with withdrawals has a significant impact on your nest egg, especially during times of market upheaval. This is damaging for everyone and can impact the legacy plans of HNW individuals. Strategies, such as diversification, a cash pile, thoughtful planning, and strategic spending, can be employed by all to help reduce the ramifications of a bad market.",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings I hate to admit this one, really. But the setup on Nvidia's (NVDA) stock into earnings on Wednesday evening has meconfused. Granted, I left the sell-side analyst gig over 10 years ago and no longer recommend stocks. But it's hard to shake old habits, and for me, that's trying to figure out how a stock will react in the 24 hours after an earnings report hits the wires. For this Nvidia report, I'm stumped on which way the market might go \u2014 though I have concerns that investors may sell on the news. Nvidia's gross profit margins are compressing as Blackwell chips have entered the mix. The Street is anxiously awaiting management's confidence in a gross margin recovery back to when it targeted mid-70% levels in the second half of the year. Given the headwinds in the economy, I'm just not sure Nvidia gives that type of confident guidance. If anything, it could say gross margins will ramp above 70% in the second half of the year \u2014 but that risks letting investors down. Almost a lose-lose scenario. Second quarter sales and earnings guidance could surprise the optimistic Street as management aims to reflect the impact of the ban on H20 chips to China. While analysts have seen this coming \u2014 EPS estimates have been lowered over the past 60 days,according to Yahoo Finance data\u2014 they may be underestimating the top-line headwind. \"The stock will look for a positive catalyst (2026 visibility, gross margin recovery, new China product) to appreciate near-term, in our opinion,\" said BofA semiconductor analystVivek Aryain a note. Read more:How does Nvidia make money? Nvidia's valuation from a price-to-earnings multiple perspective is also thought-provoking. On the one hand, given the company's long-term growth potential, it looks relatively cheap. Considering the factors I mentioned above, however, the valuation could also be considered expensive. Below is some further context on Nvidia's stock ahead of earnings from those I know in the trenches. I asked this trio for their views on Nvidia's PE ratio. Keen on snagging more insight? Drop me a line on X@BrianSozziwith all Nvidia questions today and into the lead-up to earnings this coming week. I will do my very best to answer all of them! I will also note that Yahoo Finance will have special coverage of Nvidia's earnings week beginning Monday morning. So be sure to check in frequently to get your analytical dose of Nvidialive on Yahoo Finance,on demand, or indigital text form. \"In terms of Nvidia (and even Palantir), I would argue that because of the multi-year prospects (data center, AI infrastructure growth for Nvidia) and AI adoption in the various markets, that a simple P/E ratio is the not the best (right?) way to look at those stocks or even ones like ServiceNow. A PEG [price-to-earnings growth] ratio analysis better captures that multi-year opportunity (which of course we can't simply take on faith but need to corroborate and update as we move through quarters/years).\" \"I think it [the relatively low PE on Nvidia] just speaks to the skepticism the market has towards Nvidia\u2019s ability to keep up these monster beat revenue quarters. They believe Palantir's best quarters are ahead of it in terms of upside growth and they believe that Nvidia's best quarters are where we are right now and that this is as good as it gets. \"The market isn't necessarily right, and it's been like this for over a year now which is why Nvidia's stock price has treaded water. I've thought Jensen [Huang] would surprise the market with another wave of growth but it hasn\u2019t happened yet. \"Nvidia's earnings haven't led to a ripping of the stock price for over a year now. They've been just meeting expectations. However, I think they can start to show some surprise to the upside with interest in Blackwell that could bump the stock back to the $140-150 levels afterwards. Beyond that? They would really have to shock people, and I don't think we're there yet. That next big wave of growth might take another 6 months to show up.\" \"Nvidia's profits and sales are growing at an astounding rate. If you believe the growth rates will continue, then yes, you probably also think the stock is cheap. Nvidia's share price has rallied 42% from a year ago, yet the price-earnings and price-sales ratios have stayed the same. That's incredible. It's also comparably cheap. Nvidia has become one of the most well-known stocks in the world, and it's attracted money from all types of investors. Yet it still trades at a respectable P/E when you compare it to other tech stocks/semiconductor companies. It's also one of a handful of firms that has proven it can make money off of AI. That's a powerful advantage in today's AI-obsessed market. \"Also, value is in the eye of the beholder. Think of value like a designer shirt at your favorite boutique. Not everybody will pay $50 for a shirt that cost a dollar to make. Some will because they're a fan of the brand, but others will scoff at paying a premium for a basic white tee. Nvidia could have the 'cheap' label just because it benefits from its brand. That, plus it\u2019s the 'cheapest' stock in the Magnificent Seven purely by stock price. For most people, value is how much something will cost them. Nvidia at $130 is 'cheaper' than Meta (META) at $640 or Microsoft (MSFT) at $455.\" Brian Sozziis Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and the host of theOpening Bid podcast.

        "header": "Nvidia earnings, Trump tariff updates, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pauseas growing concerns about the fiscal deficithave sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump isonce again threatening to escalate tariffs. On Friday, Trump threatened toplace a direct 25% tariffon Apple products not made in the USwhile also warninghe'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week. In the week ahead, updates on the trade war andTrump's pending tax billwill remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention. The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day. President Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February. But the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries,the trade policy whipsaw in marketsis far from over. \"Safe to say for the time being we\u2019ve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,\" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.\" Friday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years. This played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (^RUT),which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&P 500's 2.6% decline. Nvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year. Read the full preview of Nvidia's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Given Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&P 500's gains. Tariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week. A fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.5% in April,down from the 2.6% seen in March.Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior. BofA senior US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients that the May inflation data, which will be released in June, will likely provide the \"first read\" of how tariffs are impacting prices. Nvidia's earnings report will effectively mark the end of the first quarter reporting period for S&P 500 companies. With 93% of the index done reporting, S&P 500 companies are on pace to have grown earnings by 12.9% compared to the prior year, far above the 7.1% expected on March 31, per FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. Butters's latest earnings research also showed that one of Wall Street strategists' looming fears heading into the reporting period never came to fruition. Despite heightened policy uncertainty, just eight companies withdrew their full-year earnings per share guidance. This is far lower than the 185 companies that withdrew guidance in the first quarter five years ago as the pandemic clouded the corporate operating outlook. Confidence in corporates' ability to navigate tariffs has been a key theme backing the recent rally in the market and the reason strategists like Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson see stocks finishing 2025 higher. \"We continue to prefer US over international equities as earnings revisions start to inflect higher for the S&P 500 relative to MSCI ACWI Ex US (CWI),\" Wilson wrote while defending his year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500.

        "content": "Graphics processing unit (GPU)giantNvidia(NVDA-1.02%)now generates most of its revenue from data center GPUs aimed at artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the data center segment produced $35.6 billion in revenue compared to just $2.5 billion for the gaming segment. Given the monstrous growth in AI accelerator demand and Nvidia's complete dominance of that market, it makes sense for the company to prioritize its data center business. However, there's a downside. Nvidia's gaming GPU business isn't getting the attention it needs, and the end result could be significant market share losses to rivalAMD(AMD-0.25%). Image source: Getty Images. Putting out solid, capable hardware is only half the battle. Gaming GPUs also require software drivers that ensure good performance with minimal bugs across a wide range of old and new games. Buggy software was the main reasonIntel'sfirst attempt at discrete graphics cardslargely fell flat. Nvidia now seems to be falling into the same trap. Reports of instability, crashes, and bugs related to Nvidia's drivers have been piling up this year. The recent launch of the RTX 5060, a midrange graphics card that starts at $299, has only escalated the situation. So far, reviews of the RTX 5060 have been borderline disastrous.\u00a0The affordable graphics card will be a tough sell due to Nvidia's driver issues. In Rock Paper Shotgun's RTX 5060 review, the new graphics card experienced crashes, severe frame rate drops, and other performance anomalies. In some cases, using Nvidia's AI-powered DLSS frame generation feature would result in worse performance. Nvidia has been pushing that feature hard to bump up perceived frame rates in games, so the DLSS troubles are particularly embarrassing. Another problem is the meager 8 gigabytes (GB) of VRAM included. In Techspot's review,\u00a0the RTX 5060 runs into problems at higher resolutions in certain games, losing badly in some cases to last-gen cards with more VRAM. In light of AMD's upcoming Radeon 9060 XT, Techspot called the RTX 5060 \"dead on arrival.\" Ouch. AMD plans to launch its Radeon 9060 XT on June 5. Two versions will be available: an 8 GB variant for $299 and a 16 GB variant for $349. While the cheaper version will run into some of the same problems as the RTX 5060, the 16 GB version could end up being a big winner among gamers on a budget who are looking to upgrade. Nvidia's driver debacle is a gift for AMD as it looks to steal away market share. Nvidia's GPUmarket sharewas as high as 90% in the third quarter of 2024, so the company has plenty to lose.\u00a0For the vast number of PC gamers using older Nvidia GPUs, the RTX 5060 won't look enticing based on the negative reviews. If AMD's 9060 XT fares better with reviewers, customer loyalty may not be enough to keep gamers in Nvidia's camp. Given how much revenue and profit Nvidia's data center GPUs are generating, even meaningful market share losses in the gaming segment won't matter much. It would be a much bigger deal for AMD, which has beenstruggling with declining gaming sales. If AMD can take advantage of Nvidia's apparent disinterest in the gaming business, the company could get a nice revenue boost this year.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-1.02%)shares soared more than 600% in the last three years. But the stock hasn't recorded any gains in 2025. Investors who are avoiding the stock because they feel the big gains are in the rearview mirror might be making a mistake. Nvidia has taken a breather so far this year amid concerns that sales of its artificial intelligence (AI) advanced chips, software, and supercomputers may have peaked. Yet all the evidence is to the contrary, and the reality is Nvidia should see strong sales growth for quite a while. The stock will likely move higher before those sales are in the books, however. With a seemingly insatiable appetite for its AI products, investors who buy Nvidia stock now may be putting themselves on track to retire millionaires. Image source: Getty Images. The most obvious people to ask about demand are the ones buying the product.Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs)are still in high demand as its customers seek to expand AI compute capacity. The leaders of several big tech names reaffirmed plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year. They includeMeta PlatformsandMicrosoft.Blackstoneis an investor intech start-ups, so it has a unique perspective on the industry. Chief Operating Officer Jon Gray recently said in a CNBC interview he is seeing a \"ton of demand\" related to AI data center investments. TeslaCEO Elon Musk also told CNBC recently that the availability of the advanced semiconductor chips needed for AI to expand is currently the biggest limitation. Musk also said power generation and transformer capacity will become limiting factors in the near future. That bodes well for Nvidia's cadence of delivering more efficient chips on an annual basis. Nvidia isn't just relying on keeping its lead in supplying GPU chips, either. That's the critical factor for thoseinvesting for retirement-- a long runway of growth is key. In addition to updating its GPU technology offering annually, Nvidia just made an important announcement that can expand its market opportunities. CEO Jensen Huang unveiled a new strategy using Nvidia's NVLink interconnect technology. NVLink is Nvidia's proprietary interconnect technology for chips that enables high-bandwidth connections between Nvidia GPUs,central processing units (CPUs), and custom silicon. It introduced NVLink Fusion, which allows third-party CPUs and accelerators to pair with Nvidia GPUs in circuit boards and server racks. NVLink Fusion will help cement Nvidia's AI ecosystem dominance by allowing a more open model to expand the creation of AI architecture Nvidia currently controls. It helps ensure that the core of the system continues to run through Nvidia's GPU platform. The open-system strategy lets Nvidia maintain control of data center infrastructure while letting competitors innovate around it. Plus, customers that are developing their own in-house strategies to save costs could instead choose to supply chips while still interconnecting with Nvidia infrastructure. First Nvidia beat the competition, now it's inviting them to work with it. That's the right long-term strategy for investors who are alsothinking long term. It could accelerate the use of Nvidia platforms by more industries that might prefer a \"plug-and-play\" type option. If it wasn't already, Nvidia has secured its position as the standard for scaling AI systems. Investors could do well to own shares now as its growing ecosystem will result in growing sales and profits for years to come. It might just be the best stock market option for those looking to retire as millionaires.",

        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to launch a new AI chipset for China amid U.S. export curbs, Reuters reported on Saturday, with mass production likely to begin as early as next month. The GPU will be part of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s Blackwell-architecture AI processors. It is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, significantly lower than the recently restricted H20 model. A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. The lower price reflects the GPU\u2019s weaker specifications, which sources say will be based on RTX Pro 6000D and use GDDR7 memory in place of more advanced memory. They also added that it will not use TSMC\u2019s advanced CoWoS packaging technology. China is an attractive market for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The country accounted for nearly 13% of its sales last year. This is the third instance of the company having to tailor a GPU for the Chinese market due to restrictions from American authorities. After the U.S. banned the H20 chip in April this year, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) considered manufacturing a downgraded version of the chip for China, but the plan did not work out. Sources also told Reuters that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was planning to build another Blackwell AI chip for China, with production expected to begin in September. The company\u2019s market share in China has declined since 2022 due to the U.S. export restrictions, resulting in an increasing number of Chinese customers turning toward Huawei's chips. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about thischeapest AI stock.

        "content": "Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) plans to invest approximately $40 billion in high-performance chips from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power OpenAI\u2019s new AI-focused data center in Texas, according to a report from The Financial Times. The move underscores the accelerating arms race among tech giants to secure the infrastructure needed to support next-generation artificial intelligence models.  The facility, located in Abilene, Texas, is part of a $500 billion initiative led by OpenAI and SoftBank Group. As the first Stargate U.S. site, the data center is expected to support 1.2 gigawatts of computing power when fully operational by mid-2026.  Oracle intends to acquire roughly 400,000 of Nvidia\u2019s GB200 chips, the company\u2019s most advanced processors for AI training and inference. Rather than operate the center directly, Oracle will lease the computing capacity to OpenAI under a reported 15-year agreement.  The Texas site will be among the world\u2019s largest when completed, solidifying both Oracle\u2019s and OpenAI\u2019s ambitions in large-scale infrastructure.  The announcement follows a separate collaboration unveiled this week between the three companies, alongside G42, SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984), and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), to build Stargate UAE, a 1-gigawatt AI cluster headquartered in Abu Dhabi. The UAE facility will be housed within the larger UAE\u2013U.S. AI Campus and is designed to support global-scale AI advancement across industries.  As chip demand surges, Oracle\u2019s multi-year investment signals confidence not only in Nvidia\u2019s hardware but also in OpenAI\u2019s ability to lead the next era of compute-intensive applications. \u201cAI is the most transformative force of our time,\u201d said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week. \u201cWith Stargate, we are building the infrastructure to power the future.\"",

The chipmaking giant recently\u00a0returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization\u00a0level after its share price\u00a0rallied by around 50%\u00a0from its April low. The earnings report follows the company\u2019s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to\u00a0Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported\u00a078% year-over-year revenue growth\u00a0in its prior earnings release.\u00a0Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology\u00a0is also scheduled to report this week.  Salesforce\u2019s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider\u00a0reported 8% revenue growth\u00a0in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had\u00a0strong potential for growth.  Thursday\u2019s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it\u00a0grew server and networking sales by 37%\u00a0in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently\u00a0raised its price target\u00a0for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP\u2019s scheduled report on Wednesday.  Costco Wholesale is on Thursday\u2019s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its\u00a0April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco\u00a0reported a 9% revenue growth\u00a0in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.  AutoZone\u2019s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an\u00a0upgrade from Bank of America Securities\u00a0as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods\u2019 expected report on Wednesday follows its\u00a0recent deal to acquire\u00a0sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).  Investors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which\u00a0competes with Tesla\u00a0(TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.  Inflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus  Friday\u2019s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases\u00a0cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is\u00a0closely watching prices\u00a0in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs.  Wednesday\u2019s expected release of the minutes of the\u00a0May meeting of the FOMC\u00a0will provide more insight into Fed officials\u2019 deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.  Revisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the\u00a0economy shrank\u00a0in the first three months of 2025.  The state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that\u00a0consumers\u2019 moods have soured\u00a0over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday\u2019s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy.",

        "content": "The recent sharp rise in US Treasury bond yields has raised questions about whether the move is ... More connected to US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism. The evidence for alternate explanations is examined.getty Despite some pundits being quite convinced that US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the reason for the recent rise in US Treasury yields, Buffalo Springfield was closer to reality when they sang, \u201cSomething\u2019s happening here, What it is ain\u2019t exactly clear.\u201d It is not disputed that 10-year US Treasury yields are 52 basis points (0.52%) higher since the 2025 low of 3.99% on April 4. Using US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) data, expected higher inflation accounted for 15 basis points, while the remaining 37 are from a higher real (after-inflation) return.  10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield DecompositionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Notably, yields were at their nadir when the betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, yields have risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Directionally, the move in yields is logical, though some might still argue that yields have increased more than is warranted.  Yields & Recession OddsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Global Yields US government bond yields in the US have risen more than many other developed countries since April 4. Interestingly, our neighbor to the North has experienced a similar increase.  10-Year Government Bond Yield Change Since US LowGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Notably, global government bond yields hit their low during the pandemic and have trended higher since then. Global YieldsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  If one looks at government yields since the end of last year, a different picture emerges. While higher government bond yields have been a global phenomenon, the US has seen slightly lower yields!   10-Year Government Bond Year-To-Date Yield ChangeGlenview Trust, Bloomberg MORE FOR YOUChange Your PIN Code Now If It\u2019s On This List\u2018The Last Of Us\u2019 Season 2, Episode 7 Recap And Review: An Action-Packed But Badly Rushed FinaleToday\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Monday, May 26 US Dollar The other proof point for those arguing for the danger of US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the recent weakness in the US currency relative to other currencies. While there is no doubt that the US dollar has been weaker year-to-date, it follows a period of exceptional relative strength. The US dollar remains stronger than it has been most of the time since 1999. Further, as shown in the historical data, periods of a weaker US dollar do not uniformly lead to higher US Treasury bond yields.US DollarGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Fiscal Policy Without exception, the fiscal position of large countries, as measured by government debt relative to GDP, deteriorated with the impact of spending during the pandemic. Most countries were already piling on more debt relative to economic activity, but the pandemic accelerated the trend.Government Debt-To-GDPGlenview Trust, IMF, Bloomberg There is no magic level of debt-to-GDP that signals disaster since countries with a more resilient economy can service more debt. Furthermore, countries like the US, which has a high per capita GDP, control of the global reserve currency, and only issues debt in that currency, can handle significantly more debt levels than most other countries. German government debt levels are understated relative to reality. While Germany isn\u2019t legally liable for the debts of its profligately spending neighbors, it shares a common currency and its share of European Union (EU) issued debt. Historically, Germany has been forced to contribute the most to bailout funds when other EU countries have encountered problems.Recent Government Debt-To-GDP RatiosGlenview Trust, IMF, Bloomberg The US House of Representatives passed its tax legislation, which, despite reports to the contrary, does not make the US fiscal situation any worse, according to Strategas. Tariffs should produce about $200 billion in revenue annually and are not included in the legislation\u2019s official scoring, leading to much confusion. The US Senate will almost certainly make some changes, so the House bill is unlikely to be the final version implemented. Market Reaction The S&P 500 sits only 5.6% below its mid-February high in a robust rebound from the 19% decline from the peak reached on April 8. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 12% below its mid-December summit.Market ReturnsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The proximate cause of the decline in stocks last week was the reheating of the tariff war, which increased the headwinds for the US and global economy. President Trump threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff and smartphone makers, notably Apple (AAPL), with a 25% tariff rate. The betting odds of recession rose to 41%, sending stocks 2.6% lower last week.Betting Odds of 2025 US RecessionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Despite the likely economic drag from the tariffs, only two expected rate cuts for 2025 are expected. There is little chance of a rate cut at the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting.Number Of Fed Rate Cuts ExpectedGlenview Trust, Bloomberg What To Watch This Week The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Friday\u2019s April inflation reading will likely be friendly. The Core PCE Price Index is the Federal Reserve\u2019s favorite measure of inflation and should moderate to 2.5% year-over-year from the 2.6% pace in March. The last Magnificent 7 stock to report earnings is Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday after the close. As the leader in artificial intelligence chips, its results and forecasts will be closely watched to judge the health of technology spending. Conclusion The rise in US Treasury yields does not point to a US-specific problem; instead, it is a function of the lower probability of an economic downturn and perhaps a shift in the global appetite for government bonds. Yields are not high enough yet to significantly negatively impact stock valuation since the higher yields are accompanied by less risk of an earnings decline from a recession. Like many other countries, the current fiscal trajectory in the US is unsustainable, but the recent tax bill wouldn\u2019t worsen things. Investors can be forgiven for wishing it improved the path, but the Senate will have their say next, and bond market participants will be watching closely. Government bond investors are demanding higher yields from most countries, so there might be a shift in the willingness of markets to fund large deficits, but it is too early to know for sure.

        "content": "Costco Wholesale (COST) is set to report its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 after the closing bell on Thursday, with analysts generally bearing bullish ratings on the stock but not expecting substantial share-price gains. Ten analysts tracked by Visible Alpha rate the stock as a \"buy,\" while the other six call the warehouse retail giant a \"hold.\" The average price target is at $1,058.40, suggesting upside of about 5% from the stock's Friday closing price, and just short of the stock's record close slightly under $1,077 on Feb. 13. Costcois expected to report an 8% increase in sales from the same time a year ago to $63.19 billion, while earnings per share are expected to rise 14% to $4.31. The retailer is expected to report 79.6 million paying members, up from 78.4 millionlast quarter. UBS analysts said Thursday that they see Costco as well-positioned to \"navigate the uncertain macro backdrop better than the vast majority of retail,\" as it can quickly stop selling a product it may no longer be able to sell at an appealing price, and replace it with another. Executives have saidCostco should be see the benefits of itsmembership fee increase, which took effect at the turn of its fiscal year in September, start to positively impact its profit in the second half of its fiscal 2025, and into fiscal 2026. The analysts said that high-margin membership revenue should give Costco more room to absorb theimpact of tariffswithout raising prices. \"There\u2019s probably not a lot that can come from this print that will change the market\u2019s perception that [Costco] is a good place to be,\" UBS analysts wrote. \"Though, its superior position, levers, and capabilities to manage the upcoming headwinds will probably be more evident as the impact of tariffs become translucent in the coming months.\" Costco shares, which have had an up-and-down year, are up about 10% in 2025.",

        "header": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before May 28? Wall Street Has a Crystal-Clear Answer for Investors.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-1.02%)shares fell sharply earlier this year as investors worried about how tariffs and export curbs would impact revenue. However, the stock recouped its losses in May as hyperscale cloud companies raised their capital spending forecasts and the Trump administration revoked the Biden-eraAI Diffusion Rule. However, there is another inflection point on the horizon. Nvidia will announce its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 after the market closes on Wednesday, May 28. The stock has often been volatile after earnings events. For instance, it declined by more than 8% following the previous report. Nevertheless, Wall Street has clear advice for investors: Among the 71 analysts who follow Nvidia, the stock has a consensus rating of \"buy\" and a median target price of $160 per share. That implies 22% upside from the current share price of $131. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia specializes in accelerated computing, a discipline that pairs specialized hardware and software to speed up complex data center workloads, such asartificial intelligence (AI). The company is best known for itsgraphics processing units (GPUs), chips often referred to as AI accelerators. According to IoT Analytics, Nvidia has more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. However, the company is truly formidable because it supplements its GPUs with adjacent hardware, like CPUs, interconnects, and networking gear, such that it essentially builds entire data centers. CEO Jensen Huang says thevertically integratedstrategy lets Nvidia build systems with the lowest total cost of ownership. Additionally, Nvidia has spent about two decades building its CUDA software platform, which now includes hundreds of code libraries, frameworks, and pretrained models that help developers build AI applications across a broad range of domains. That includes video analytics, speech recognition, recommendation engines, and customer service agents. Importantly, while generative AI capabilities have recently been the driving force behind demand for Nvidia's accelerated computing products, the company is well positioned to maintain its leadership through the next phase of the AI revolution:self-driving carsandautonomous robots. \"Physical AI and robotics will bring about the next industrial revolution,\" according to Jensen Huang. Nvidia Drive and Nvidia Isaac are platforms that support the development of self-driving cars and autonomous robots, respectively. Earlier this year, Jensen Huang said, \"We build technology that almost every self-driving car company uses.\" That list includesAlphabet's Waymo andTesla. Similarly,Amazonuses Nvidia Isaac to train, simulate, and manage its warehouse robots. Importantly, Nvidia debuted GR00T N1.5 earlier this month, a customizable foundation model for humanoid reasoning. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino believes GR00T will strengthen Nvidia's position in the AI ecosystem. He also believes the recent decision to open its NVLink interconnect technology -- which turns disparate chips into a single accelerator -- to custom chipmakers likeMarvellandMediaTekwill create new opportunities for revenue growth. Nvidia will report its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 on Wednesday, May 28. The company guided for 53% revenue growth and 49%non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles)earnings growth. But several analysts have revised their estimates lower in the last 90 days due to concerns about export restrictions and tariffs. The Wall Street consensus now says Nvidia's earnings will increase 44%. Importantly, beating that number does not necessarily guarantee a positive reaction from the market. Nvidia exceeded the top- and bottom-line estimates in the fourth quarter, but the stock fell more than 8% the next day. Investors should expect similar volatility this time around. At present, pricing data from the options market implies a 6-point swing, meaning the market expects the share price to land between $125 and $140. Investors should either listen to the conference call or read a transcript of the event. Jensen Huang will almost certainly discuss important issues like export restrictions related to theChinese market, recent deals in theSaudi Arabian market, and what the company expects concerning the semiconductor tariffs that President Donald Trump has yet to finalize. So, returning to my original question: Should you buy Nvidia before May 28? Any investor who plans to hold the stock for several years can buy a small position today. If the price declines post-earnings, consider adding a few more shares. But investors looking for a quick profit should avoid the stock. There are too many unknowns to be sure of a positive reaction.",

        "header": "Tesla Investors Just Got Great News From CEO Elon Musk: The Stock Could Soar 1,300%.",
        "content": "Tesla(TSLA-0.33%)shares have declined 15% year to date amid a flurry of bad news. The company lost 7 percentage points of market share in the first quarter, ceding the top position in electric car sales to Chinese automakerBYD, as demand deteriorated across China, Europe, and the United States. Those market share losses were due in part to factory updates that limited production of the Model Y, which still ranks as the best-selling car on the planet. However, CEO Elon Musk's involvement in politics added to the problem. And President Donald Trump created another headwind for the company by imposing a 25% tariff on imported auto parts. Fortunately, shareholders just got good news from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Encouraged by the upcoming robotaxi launch in June and Musk stepping back from theDepartment of Government Efficiencyto refocus on Tesla, he raised his target price to $500 per share. That implies 47% upside from its current share price of $339. \"We believe Tesla remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,\" Ives wrote. Better yet, shareholders also got some good news from CEO Elon Musk. Read on to learn more. Image source: Getty Images. On the first-quarter earnings call, CEO Elon Musk told analysts, \"I continue to believe that Tesla, with excellent execution, will be the most valuable company in the world by far. ... It may be as valuable as the next five companies combined.\" Musk made a similar comment on the fourth-quarter earnings call a few months earlier: \"There is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined. And that is overwhelming due to autonomous vehicles andautonomous humanoid robots.\" The top five companies --Apple,Microsoft,Nvidia,Amazon, andAlphabet-- currently have a collective market value of $14 trillion, and Tesla is worth about $1 trillion. So, Musk's prediction currently implies 1,300% upside as the company leans into major opportunities in autonomous driving and robotics products. For years, Elon Musk has insisted Tesla is more than anelectric car manufacturer. Instead, he has frequently told analysts that Tesla is better described as anautonomous drivingand humanoid robotics company. \"I see a path to creating anartificial intelligence [AI]and robotics juggernaut of truly immense capability and power,\" he said in January 2024. Tesla has finally reached a turning point where those ambitions could become a reality. The company plans to launch its first autonomous ride-sharing service in Austin, Texas, next month, with other U.S. cities to follow before the end of the year. Musk believes autonomous driving could \"move the financial needle in a significant way\" by the second half of next year. Alphabet's Waymo beat Tesla to the market by several years. It already provides robotaxi services in several U.S. cities. But Musk thinks Tesla will eventually have 99% market share due to certain advantages. First, Tesla has more cars on the road, so it has more data to train its AI models. Second, its full self-driving software relies entirely on computer vision, which is cheaper than using the radar and lidar sensors that Waymo uses. Additionally, Tesla should be able to scale its autonomous ride-sharing business much more quickly because it plans to crowdsource vehicles. \"We'll have a model which is kind of like a combination ofUberandAirbnb. So, if you're a Tesla owner, you'll be able to add or subtract your car from the fleet,\" Musk explained during a recent CNBC interview. Wall Street currently expects Tesla's earnings to grow by 13% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 150times earningslook very expensive. But the consensus includes estimates from 54 analysts, not all of whom think Tesla will successfully transition into AI and robotics. So, investors need to decide for themselves whether they think the company can make that leap. Anyone who believes Tesla will disrupt the mobility market with autonomous driving technology (and the labor market with autonomous humanoid robots) should own the stock. However, Elon Musk himself has warned, \"If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company.\"",

        "content": "By Liam Mo and Fanny Potkin BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia will launch a newartificial intelligencechipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said. The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources. The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements. It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said. They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology. The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported. The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its \"limited\" options. \"Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market.\" TSMC declined to comment. MARKET SHARE PLUNGE China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development. After the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions. Reuters was unable to determine the product's final name. Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information. According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant. Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei which produces the Ascend 910B chip. Huang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips. The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales. The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing. Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of. GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.

        "content": "We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) designs, manufactures, and markets electrical, electronic, and fiber optic connectors. On May 22, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan raised the firm\u2019s price target on the stock to $90 from $85 and kept a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating on the shares. The reaffirmation follows Nvidia\u2019s announcement of NVLink Fusion at Computex 2025 earlier in the week. A team of technicians assembling a complex electrical connector in a factory environment. The NVLink Fusion is Nvidia\u2019s latest silicon technology that lets industries build semi-custom AI infrastructure. NVLink Fusion will allow the company to provide NVLink to cloud service providers, allowing CSPs to connect Nvidia GPUs with ARM-based CPUs from companies such as Qualcomm and Fujitsu. As such, the announcement of NVLink Fusion is supposedly a tailwind to Amphenol\u2019s estimates. However, there is also the belief that CSPs may continue to prefer using the traditional Nvidia Grace Blackwell 200 and 300s. Overall, APHranks 8thon our list of AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of APH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have been some of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It makes a lot of sense, too. AI chips are the brains that power and train generative AI models, helping businesses build new products and services at warp speed -- ushering in a new wave of productivity, efficiency, and automation. For the most part, however, one name emerges more often than others in the chip realm. Obviously, I'm talking aboutNvidia. I can't deny that what Nvidia has achieved over the last two years isn't impressive. Don't get me wrong -- I'mveryhappy to be an investor in Nvidia stock. But as a long-term investor, I'm always looking for opportunities beyond the mainstream. EnterAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.25%). With a share price decline of 31% over the last year, AMD may not look like your cup of tea. However, I'd encourage you to keep an open mind. Let's explore how AMD is making inroads in the AI chip landscape, and why now looks like a lucrative time to buy the stock hand over fist. AMD reports its financials across three business segments: Data center, client and gaming, and embedded. The data center segment competes directly with Nvidia, and recent trends in this business unit have really caught my eye. The table below breaks down AMD's data center financial profile over the last year. \u00a0Over the past year, AMD has scaled its AIdata centerbusiness considerably. All the while, operating profit margins have been expanding -- signaling that AMD is able to fulfill demand and build its chip business in a profitable way. Data source: Investor Relations. One thing to call out is that over the last six months, it may look like AMD's chip business is beginning to show some signs slowing. I wouldn't be caught up in that idea, though. First, the semiconductor industry tends to be cyclical. Moreover, Nvidia launched its newest graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture (Blackwell) during the fourth quarter, which likely served as some form of a headwind for AMD. Nevertheless, AMD has nearly doubled its operating income in the chip business over the past year, while still accelerating sales by high double-digit percentages. Furthermore, the company is launching new architectures of its own later this year -- andAMD's CEO Lisa Su sounds quite confidentthat these products will be a big hit with customers. Image source: Getty Images. Perhaps the biggest reason I'm excited about AMD's future is because of the company's proven ability to win notable customers. For example,Microsoft,Oracle, andMeta Platformsare all using AMD's MI300 accelerators in addition to their respective Nvidia GPUs. On top of that,Amazon-- another Nvidia customer -- recently made astrategic investment in AMD. This very well could signal partnership opportunities between AMD and Amazon's thriving cloud infrastructure business. Over the coming quarters, my outlook is that AMD's data center business will continue generating a combination of revenue growth and margin expansion, thanks to encouraging shipment trends for MI325, MI350, MI355, and MI400 series chipsets. Right now, AMD'sforward price-to-earnings(P/E) multiple is hovering well below its 10-year average.  AMD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. It seems to me that investors are questioning AMD's ability to capturerising AI infrastructure spend from the hyperscalers. What I find perplexing, however, is that AMD has already proven it can do this, but for some reason the company isn't getting much credit for the growth in its data center business. In my eyes,AMD is a no-brainer buying opportunityright now, and investors should consider taking advantage of the disparity in its current valuation multiples compared to historical trends. I think the stock is cheap based on forward earnings, and long-term investors should consider holding on to a position in AMD over the next several years.",

        "content": "Rain AI, a San Francisco-based chip startup backed byOpenAICEOSam Altman, is exploring a sale after its ambitious $150 million Series B funding round failed to secure investors. Despite early backing from Altman in a $25 million seed round in 2022, Rain AI has struggled to convert technical ambition into scalable business outcomes. The company, which aimed to rival industry giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with its energy-efficientchips, is now in discussions with potential buyers, including OpenAI, according toNew York Post.

Wiredreports that Rain AI aimed to develop neuromorphic chips designed to process AI workloads more efficiently by mimicking how the human brain functions. According to Wired, the company hoped these chips would deliver better performance at a fraction of the power consumption compared to traditional graphics processing units, making them ideal for generative AI models. According to the Post, testing showed promising results, but the company failed to secure major commercial contracts or letters of intent, a problem that hampered investor confidence. One source close to the company told the Post that the founders were talented engineers but lacked the sales acumen to close enterprise deals.

Rain AI\u2019s co-founder,Jack Kendall,acknowledged to stakeholders that the company was rapidly depleting its cash reserves and urgently required a $3 million bridge fund to sustain operations while negotiating a potential acquisition. The Post says that the company has since secured the emergency funding and entered what was described as \u201cgood progress\u201d in acquisition talks with multiple interested parties. These talks involve several high-profile technology firms that view Rain AI's hardware as a strategic foothold in the increasingly competitive chip market. While the company had originally planned to launch its Series B round in December, the raise was delayed repeatedly due to leadership instability and difficulty closing large institutional checks, the Post reports. The company also hired former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) veteranJean-Didier Allegruccito lead chip development efforts, bringing experience from Apple's custom silicon division, the Post says.

Rain AI is now in discussions with multiple technology giants about a potential acquisition. OpenAI, which has begun interviewing Rain employees to assess talent fit, is a top contender. Altman had previously pitched OpenAI investors to support Rain AI's Series B, aiming for a $600 million valuation, according to the Post. Rain AI's uncertain future unfolds against a backdrop of aggressive expansion in the AI hardware ecosystem. The Post reports that Nvidia,Elon Musk'sxAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) are among the giants investing more than $30 billion to build the next generation of AI infrastructure.

The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales. The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing. Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of. GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.

        "header": "Nvidia to launch cheaper Blackwell AI chip for China after US export curbs, sources say",
        "content": "By Liam Mo and Fanny Potkin BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said. The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources. The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements. It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said. They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology. The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported. The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its \"limited\" options. \"Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market.\" TSMC declined to comment. China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development. After the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions. Reuters was unable to determine the product's final name. Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information. According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant. Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei which produces the Ascend 910B chip. Huang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is set to release its first quarter earnings results after the market close on Wednesday, May 28. In the video above, Sean McLaughlin, chief options strategist at All Star Charts, shares how he is using options to play the results. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere. Nvidia set to report first quarter earnings on Wednesday. Options traders tracked by Bloomberg predicting the stock will likely gain or lose as much as 7.4% the following day. That would be a lower level of volatility than what we've seen the last eight quarters with an average swing of over 11%. Joining us now, we've got Sean McLaughlin. He is All Star Charts Chief Options strategist. Sean, great to speak with you. I know you've sent over in your notes that if you were trading Nvidia right now, you'd be positioning for a neutral to positive earnings reaction. Talk to me about why that's your base case. So, what I tend to see happen when earnings events happen is that if there is a surprise move in the market, that surprise move tends to happen in the direction of the underlying trend. And there's no denying that the underlying trend in Nvidia and all the quantum stocks, uh, has been up, uh, coming off the Liberation Day lows. Uh, and so, if there is any surprise, I think Nvidia is going to be higher. Um, I'm not necessarily predicting that we will have a huge pop higher, but I think if there is one to happen, odds are it will be higher. I think more likely Nvidia is going to have maybe a little a muted response, a little underwhelming response, uh, to the market or to the expectations. And therefore, as an options trader, I want to play this, uh, play this earnings event with an option spread that that pays me whether the stock goes up, the stock goes sideways. Really, I I just don't want it to go down very big. That that's the way I'm playing it. Sean, can you operationalize that for me and for our options traders listening in? What exactly is your approach to that? Sure. So I'm going to utilize an in-the-money call spread. A vertical spread that it consists of an in-the-money option or in-the-money call and an at a short and an at-the-money call. So what I'm doing is I'm leveraging the fact that there's a lot of premium at the at-the-money strike. So looking at Nvidia right now, it's trading at 130, in the neighborhood of 130. So I want to be short the 130 strike, but I want to buy the 120 strike. So there's $10 wide difference between those strikes. And I want a position in the options that expire next Friday, that's May 30th. That's the the soonest expiration following earnings. And because I'm getting a lot of premium to sell that 130 strike right now, if Nvidia were to absolutely crash, I don't think it will, but it could, right? It it could happen. Well, playing this event with an option spread, I will be better protected versus say a normal stock trader. If I'm long Nvidia stock and the stock gaps down to, let's say, 110 or 120 following earnings, I'm going to lose a lot more money had I been positioned in stock versus, uh, the options because of the fact that I'm selling premium at the at-the-money strike, which really gives me a lot of cushion.",

        "header": "Is Intel Corp Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "The past few years have been difficult -- to say the least -- forIntel(INTC-2.34%). Competitors likeNvidiahave seen their share prices balloon thanks to the rapid rise of AI technologies. Yet, Intel shares have lost nearly a third of their value over the past 12 months alone. If you've been looking for an undervaluedAI stock, this could be your chance. Intel stock has some important advantages right now, but you'll also want to be wary of some risks. Overall, however, shares could have massive upside potential as aturnaroundstory. On the surface, Intel and Nvidia have a lot in common. Both manufacture graphics processing units (GPUs) -- critical components that make modern computing possible, including most machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks. Yet Intel shares are noticeably cheaper, with the company garnering a much smaller market cap. Intel's profitability, meanwhile, is significantly lower. Why is Intel priced at such a discount to Nvidia? There are many reasons, but the biggest is that Nvidia was more prepared for the AI revolution than Intel.  NVDA PS Ratiodata byYCharts. Bloomberg News calls Nvidia's GPUs the \"workhorse for training AI models\" for a good reason. Nvidia invested in specialized chips designed for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications early. Its CUDA developer suite, launched in 2006, has been allowing developers to customize its chips to create unparalleled performance advantages while also locking them into Nvidia's ecosystem. The result has been superior products that customers are reluctant to abandon, giving Nvidia a 70% to 95% market share for most market segments related to AI, like data centers. Due to a lack of foresight and some strategic mistakes, Intel has been left in the dust. Its GPUs can't match Nvidia's performance, and its developer ecosystem is similarly inferior. But are shares cheap enough to bet on a turnaround? Previous chip wars have seen losers become winners over time. Could the same be true for Intel? Image source: Getty Images. Intel won't compete in a meaningful way with Nvidia when it comes to AI GPUs anytime soon. \"This is not a quick fix,\" Intel's incoming CEO announced earlier this month. The company's research and development budget is still higher right now, but Nvidia is quickly catching up. Given its size, expect Nvidia's innovation budget to surpass Intel's within a year or two. Still, Nvidia's is outcompeting when it comes to creating next-gen AI chips. Its Blackwell architecture, for example, had a 12-month waiting period earlier this year due to excess demand. Its developer suite -- in use for nearly two decades -- will continue to keep developers locked into its ecosystem. If AI spending takes off like it's expected to, however, there will be plenty of room for multiple winners. Intel is investing aggressively in new, higher-performance chips. It's also investing heavily to expand its software suite. Due to industry supply challenges, it also has the opportunity to compete on price, even if its total offerings remain relatively weak compared to Nvidia. Is Intel a worthwhile turnaround bet? It's tough to say. The company is struggling to remain profitable in today's competitive environment, with sales growth expected to be negative for the year to come. With a market capitalization of under $100 billion versus Nvidia's market cap of more than $3 trillion, however, the upside potential is clear. But only investors willing to take on a very long holding period for a high-risk, high-reward stock should consider jumping in.",

        "content": "As the unseasonably warm weather continued, there was a thawing in relations between the UK and its European neighbours after their acrimonious divorce five years ago. News of a wide-ranging post-Brexit deal that cemented ties in defence and trade got the week off to a bright start. This should have lifted the markets, but some gloomy news from the other side of the Atlantic eclipsed any sunshine in the hearts of investors. The US lost its last,highly-prized triple-A credit ratingthanks to a Moody\u2019s downgrade, snuffing out any hopes of astock marketrally in London and Europe. It wasn't all sun and light for the UK either. On Wednesday,inflation came in well above forecastsbecause of a surge in household bills and employers\u2019 expenses in what was dubbed \u2018Awful April\u2019. The 3.5% reading, well above target, gives theBank of Englandsomething to think about, and traders scaled back their bets on further rate cuts in 2025. April was equally awful for fiscal data. Government borrowing came in much higher than expected and \u00a31bn higher than the previous month, despite increased receipts from national insurance contributions by employers. Now, you may have noticed, we almost got through a week with no mention of tariffs. Almost. Perhaps inevitably, the week ended with a market shock courtesy of Donald Trump, who threatened the EU with an eye-watering 50% tariff and declared negotiations between his team and the bloc were \"going nowhere\". At the same time, he said tech behemoth Apple would facea 25% levy on its iPhonesunless they are manufactured in the US. Let's take a look at some of the highlights from an eventful few days, before turning our attention to the week ahead. More interest rate cuts in doubt after surprise inflation surge The stronger-than-forecast inflation reading for April, based largely on a surge in utilities bills and travel costs for households, makes it harder for the Bank of England to ease interest rates. This change in dynamic was reflected in a withdrawal by market traders of bets on rate cuts for the year. Markets are now pricing in just one additional quarter-point cut in 2025, reflecting growing concern that the pace of price rises may prove more persistent than previously thought. According to money markets, the probability of a rate reduction in August has slipped to 50%, down from 60% prior to the latest inflation figures. UK government borrowing hits \u00a320.2bn in April Inflation wasn't the only thing exceeding expectations, unfortunately for the government. Chancellor Rachel Reeves' problems worsened when April's data for UK borrowing came in \u00a31bn higher than the previous month and more than \u00a32bn above forecasts. It all adds up to an increased likelihood of tax rises, according to Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics. \"April\u2019s public finances figures showed that despite the boost from the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, the fiscal year got off to a poor start,\" she said. \"This raises the chances that if the chancellor wishes to stick to her fiscal rules, more tax hikes in the autumn budget will be required.\" Bitcoin price hits all-time high above $111,000 There was at least some good news for holders of the world's leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) broke its price record as institutional appetite and regulatory support for the digital asset continue to grow. Supply dynamics are also playing a part in the price surge. The amount of bitcoin held on centralised cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped to historic lows, indicating a shift towards self-custody and reducing readily available supply. According to CryptoQuant, exchange reserves are at an all-time low. UK 'bargain' stocks that have outperformed the market long-term Some things seem too good to be true, and we're taught not to trust those things. But a number of FTSE 350 (^FTLC) stocks trading at steep discounts and easily outperforming the market are certainly a tempting prospect for would-be investors. These \"hidden gems\" range from household names to industrial firms, and are trading at a significantly lower price-to-earnings ratio, compared to their five-year average. \u201cWith such a heavy focus on US tech and the hugely volatile global macro environment, UK investors may have missed some of the quiet compounders closer to home, something recently noted by BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. You may not be an Elon Musk or a Bill Gates, but have you ever wondered if you actually qualify as being \"rich\"?

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Given the currenteconomic uncertaintyunleashed by President Donald Trump's on-again, off-againtariffpolicy, parking some cash in reserve feels prudent. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or are shifting funds from more volatile investments, it's important to consider how much you can earn from different cash strategies. Fortunately, the options are excellent right now, as returns continue to be buoyed by theFederal Reserve'sbenchmark federal funds interest rateremaining high. Not only that, but it appears likely the central bank will keep the fed funds rate where it is for two more meetings. According to theCME Group's FedWatch Tool, financial markets are currently pricing in more than a 70% probability that the first 2025 rate cut won't come before the Fed's Sept. 17 rate announcement. That would be good news for savers, as the rates that banks, credit unions, and brokerages are willing to pay on your savings are directly impacted by thefederal funds rate. Anytime the Fed cuts that benchmark rate, rates for savings, money market, and CD accounts fall as well. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, as of Friday's market close, and indicate the change from a week prior. The rates below are the top nationally available APYs from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. Note thatsavings and money market account rates are variable, meaning the bank is free to lower them at any time. In contrast, CD rates are locked and guaranteed for the certificate's full term. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed but can change at any time. Treasury securities pay their rate through maturityand can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect, or can be bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage.I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirectand can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account\u2014sometimes called ahigh-yield savings account\u2014that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you16 options that pay 4.35% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type\u2014money market or savings\u2014pays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.37% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includes more than a dozen optionspaying 4.50% APY. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.93% to 4.21% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds \"swept\" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- or 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.96% to 5.04%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsstraight fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect\u2014the U.S. Treasury\u2019s online platform for buying federal government securities\u2014has no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. While you own the bond, your rate will change every six months. I bond rates just went up on May 1, from 3.11% for bonds issued during the previous six months to 3.98% for new bonds purchased between May 1 and Oct. 31, 2025. ForexistingI bond holders, your next six-month rate will also increase\u2014by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe recent rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

        "header": "These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Look Cheap Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence industry is booming, which makes it an attractive sector to invest in. But AI hype has pushed up stock prices for several tech companies and inflated their valuations in many cases. Fortunately, investors looking for AI bargains can still find some. One of these isTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-2.02%), popularly known as TSMC, whichNvidiaemploys to construct its AI chips. Two others areSuper Micro Computer(SMCI-2.90%), commonly called Supermicro, and Google parentAlphabet(GOOGL-1.37%)(GOOG-1.34%). Looking at theprice-to-earnings(P/E) ratio of these three AI stocks compared to Nvidia reveals that they are trading at much lower valuations at the time of writing.  Data byYCharts. These three companies saw downward pressure on their share prices because of various headwinds. A big one is the global economic uncertainty introduced by President Donald Trump'stariff policies. But thesecular trendof AI promises to boost each company's business over the long run. Beyond their relatively cheap valuations, here's why each is a buy. Image source: Getty Images. TSMC is a compelling investment because of its leadership in manufacturing chips used to process AI tasks. Its expertise in efficiently producing 3-nanometer (nm) chips in large quantities is leading to rapid sales growth. This tech contributed 22% of the company's $25.5 billion in first-quarter revenue, up from just 9% in the prior year. Although it's seeing success with its 3nm technology, TSMC is already looking to the next step. The manufacturer is working on its next-generation tech, 2nm, which it expects to enter production later this year. TSMC's technological achievements helped it grow Q1 sales by a strong 35% year over year to $25.5 billion. Moreover, its Q1gross marginrose to 58.8%, up from 53.1% in the previous year, demonstrating efficiency in managing costs. Although the dynamic situation with tariffs introduces possible volatility into TSMC's business in the near term, the company forecast Q2 revenue to reach between $28.4 billion to $29.2 billion. That would be an outstanding increase of at least 37% from the prior year's $20.8 billion. Also, TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion in federal government funding as part of the CHIPS Act to build semiconductor fabrication facilities in the United States. So the company is in a great position to see long-term business growth. Supermicro sells servers and data storage solutions to businesses building AI systems. The company was beset by a series of short-term issues in 2024 that sent its stock tumbling, including the resignation of its auditor, but it has sincesorted out the issues. In its fiscal 2025 Q3 (ended March 31), Supermicro's revenue reached $4.6 billion, a 19% increase year over year. Despite the growth, the result failed to meet the company's forecast for at least $5 billion in sales as customer purchasing delays pushed \"some sales into Q4 and later,\" according to CFO David Weigand. Like TSMC, the current macroeconomic climate induced by tariffs affects Supermicro in the short term, but AI's growth can buoy the company over time. After all, the AI market is forecast to expand from 2024's $184 billion to a whopping $826 billion by 2030. In fact, Supermicro estimates it will close out fiscal 2025 with sales between $21.8 billion and $22.6 billion. That would be a strong increase from the prior year's $14.9 billion. The company already exceeded the previous year's total revenue through the first three quarters of fiscal 2025 with sales of $16.2 billion. That means its revenue goal for the year is within reach. Google parent Alphabet is investing heavily in AI. The company spent $52.5 billion incapital expenditureslast year to build cutting-edge AI systems. Today, every product the company owns with at least half a billion users has incorporated Alphabet's AI. The addition of AI to products such as Google's search engine and itscloud computingbusiness, Google Cloud, contributed to both seeing double-digit year-over-year sales growth in Q1. Google hit $50.7 billion, and its cloud division earned $12.3 billion. This performance helped Alphabet reach $90.2 billion in total Q1 revenue, up from $80.5 billion in 2024. Another example of Alphabet's AI success is Waymo, its self-driving car business. Waymo's service uses AI to make autonomous driving decisions, and now supplies more than 250,000 passenger rides per week, a fivefold increase from last year. Alphabet's stock is down not only because of current macroeconomic conditions; Google also lost two keyantitrust casesover the past year. But the conglomerate has the opportunity to appeal the decisions, so these short-term challenges do not necessarily translate into an impact on its business. Although TSMC, Supermicro, and Alphabet face(d) headwinds that pushed share prices down, the situation has created a buying opportunity for investors with along-term mindset. The AI market's ongoing expansion and the success these companies have already demonstrated with AI position these three businesses to grow in the coming years. Their current compelling stock valuations make now a good time to scoop up shares.",

        "header": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Just Sold Shares of Nvidia and 2 Other AI Powerhouses and Bought Shares of This Nvidia-Backed Company",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has driven stock market gains over the past couple of years, but the momentum may be far from over. Not only do analysts predict an AI market of more than $2 trillion by the early 2030s, but current activity in the space supports that. Technology companies fromMeta PlatformstoAlphabet(GOOG-1.34%)(GOOGL-1.37%)have announced billions of dollars in spending to support AI projects. Data center buildout continues. And there are more AI stages to come, such as the moment of AI agents, when companies will apply AI to handle complex real-world problems. All of this is right up the alley of billionaire Philippe Laffont, who as founder of Coatue Management, focuses on innovators and invests heavily in tech companies. In fact, the biggest positions in Coatue's $22.6 billion portfolio are Meta andAmazon, each with weightings of more than 9%. So, it may seem surprising that right now, with so much ahead for AI, Laffont just sold some shares of top AI chip designerNvidia(NVDA-1.02%)and two other AI giants. But, at the same time, Laffont picked up shares of an Nvidia-backed company that could become the next AI powerhouse. Let's take a look at his moves and consider the potential of this newish player. Image source: Getty Images. First, as mentioned, it's important to keep in mind that Laffont isn't just dabbling in AI, but is someone who specializes in the technology sector and heavily invests in today's leaders and tomorrow's potential leaders. Laffont holds a computer science degree from MIT and went on to hone his investing skills at Tiger Management, one of the world's first hedge funds. He then became known as one of the \"Tiger Cubs,\" Tiger employees who later launched their own funds -- and he founded Coatue in 1999. It's clear that, considering Laffont's experience and investment priorities, he has his finger on the pulse of the AI market. So, he could offer investors inspiration as they look for AI stocks to buy. In the first quarter of this year, Laffont made the following moves: And what Nvidia-backed AI stock did Laffont add to his portfolio?CoreWeave(CRWV2.66%), a company that in late March completed its initial public offering (IPO) and has since seen its stock surge more than 160%, bringing the company's market value to more than $50 billion. Laffont made a decent-sized bet on this player, buying 14,402,999 shares. The IPOitself was considered a flop, as the stock stagnated during its first trading session, then fell before eventually gathering some positive momentum. President Donald Trump's import tariff plans weighed on stocks -- specifically growth players -- and that created a difficult environment for CoreWeave's first trading days. Since, though, optimism about trade deals that won't weigh heavily on the economy and the support of Nvidia have helped CoreWeave stock take off. Nvidia recently said it had a 7% stake in CoreWeave as of March 31. These two tech giants are closely linked because CoreWeave's business is tied to demand for Nvidia'sgraphics processing units(GPUs). This young company offers customers access to its fleet of 250,000 Nvidia GPUs -- in fact, users can even rent access to them by the hour. So, working with CoreWeave brings customers great flexibility along with the power of Nvidia's top AI chips. This helped CoreWeave report a 420% increase in revenue in the recent quarter to $981 million. It's important to keep in mind, though, that to build up its GPU platform, CoreWeave also built up a considerable level of debt. As of the end of the quarter, current debt totaled $3.8 billion, and non-current debt totaled $4.9 billion. Meanwhile, CoreWeave must continue spending heavily to keep growth going and serve demand -- the company forecasts capital spending of as much as $23 billion this year. And CoreWeave expects annual revenue to reach $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. It's clear that for a big tech investor like Laffont, it makes sense to lock in some gains from AI giants that have been in the portfolio for a while -- and bet on a new player that's still in its early growth stages. But before you follow Laffont, it's key to consider your investment style. If you're uncomfortable with risk and prefer stability, you're better off sticking with well-established AI players --such as Nvidia, AMD, or Alphabet. And Laffont, too, continues to believe in their stories as they remain in his portfolio. But, if you're an aggressive investor looking for the next big AI growth story -- and you don't mind some risk and volatility along the way -- you might consider picking up a few shares of CoreWeave. Significant upside could lie ahead as the AI boom continues.",

        "header": "Bitcoin New All-Time High: If History Is Any Guide, This Happens Next",
        "content": "On May 22,Bitcoin(BTC0.31%)hit a new all-time high of nearly $112,000. With a total market cap of $2.2 trillion, it now ranks as one of the five most valuable assets in the world, trailing onlyApple(AAPL-2.88%),Nvidia(NVDA-1.02%),Microsoft(MSFT-0.82%), and gold. Based on the above, it might seem likeBitcoinis a no-brainer investment right now. But is it? Let's take a closer look at the historical evidence for Bitcoin. Given that Bitcoin started trading in January 2009, we now have 16 years of history to examine. And the overwhelming evidence is that Bitcoin tends to trade in fairly well-defined four-year cycles. The cycle begins with a steady accumulation phase, which leads to a growth phase, which leads to a bubble phase, which ultimately ends in a steep decline or even a crash. At which point, the whole cycle starts anew. Image source: Getty Images. The defining moment of every four-year cycle is theBitcoin halving, which takes place -- you guessed it -- every four years. By knowing when the most recent halving event took place, it's relatively easy to know where Bitcoin is in any four-year cycle. That's because the halving is typically the signal for Bitcoin to move from the growth phase to the bubble phase. And that's what has me so concerned right now. Based on the historical evidence, the bubble phase lasts anywhere from 12 to 18 months. So, let's do the math. The most recent Bitcoin halving took place in April 2024, which means that we're more than 12 months into the bubble phase of the cycle. Thus, even though all lights appear to be flashing green for Bitcoin right now, there could be trouble ahead. The time to be most concerned about Bitcoin is when everyone is convinced that Bitcoin is a slam-dunk investment. And that's what's happening now: Retail investors are buying every dip on Bitcoin, corporations are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and even the U.S. government is trying to figure out a way to buy Bitcoin. Still not convinced? Then take a closer look at Bitcoin's chart from the previous four-year cycle, which included a halving event on May 11, 2020. On the date of the halving, Bitcoin was trading at about $10,000. During the next 12 months, it eventually hit a price of $60,000 in April 2021. But then, out of nowhere, Bitcoin suddenly collapsed to the $30,000 level. To most crypto observers at the time, it looked like Bitcoin was done. The dreaded fourth phase of the historical cycle -- the crash -- looked like it had arrived. But, as turns out, Bitcoin once again recovered, regained its all-time high, and then soared all the way to $69,000 by the end of 2021.  Bitcoin / U.S. dollar chartby TradingView After that, you know the ending to the story. Bitcoin collapsed again, falling all the way to $16,000 by November 2022. And then the whole cycle started again. Accumulation led to rapid growth in 2023 and 2024, which led to Bitcoin hitting another all-time high in January 2025, which led to Bitcoin briefly collapsing in value to the $75,000 price level in early 2025 before recovering to hit another all-time high in May. Admittedly, history does not always repeat. And it can be misleading to draw too many lessons from the historical data. But you have to admit one thing: The performance of Bitcoin in 2025 is uncannily similar to its performance during the previous Bitcoin bull market rally in 2021. Back then, its all-time high was followed by an immediate price decline, and then followed by a brand-new all-time high. Trying to predict the future price of Bitcoin in the near-term is a fool's errand. Typically, as soon as Bitcoin hits a new all-time high, it becomes much more volatile. The intraday price swings become much more dramatic, and the price of Bitcoin can bounce all over the place. For all the investors and traders who are convinced that Bitcoin is going to soar to $200,000 from here, you have investors and traders saying that Bitcoin is going to fall all the way back to $69,000. Just about the only thing that you can predict about Bitcoin is plenty ofvolatility. But even if Bitcoin does follow the same four-year historical pattern described above, I'm not worried. It just means that I will have to wait another four years for even more amazing gains from the world's fifth-most valuable asset.",

        "content": "President Trump has made radical changes to U.S. trade policy since taking office. The tariffs imposed by his administration have pushed the average tax rate on U.S. imports to its highest level in decades, causing some investors to lose confidence in American stocks. Consequently, theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.67%), the best gauge for the U.S. stock market, has underperformed benchmark indexes in Asia, Canada, and Europe this year. The index has also underperformed stock markets in emerging economies like Brazil, Mexico, and many African countries. Nevertheless,JPMorganCEO Jamie Dimon recently told Bloomberg the U.S. is still the best place to invest: \"If you were to take all of your money and put it in one country, it would still be America. I mean, it's still the most prosperous nation on the planet.\" Indeed, 21 of the 25 largest companies in the world are American companies. Included on that list areNvidia(NVDA-1.02%)andAmazon(AMZN-0.87%). Here's why those stocks are smart long-term investments. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia earns about half of its revenue from the United States, but that number has trended higher in recent years because the U.S. possesses more than 60% ofartificial intelligence(AI) compute capacity worldwide. The company is the leader in data centergraphics processing units(GPUs), chips that are the industry standard in accelerating AI workloads. Importantly, while generative AI has dominated headlines since ChatGPT launched in 2022, the AI revolution is still in its early stages. Nvidia has the hardware and software needed to develop autonomous robots and self-driving cars. \"We build technology that almost every self-driving car company uses,\" CEO Jensen Huang told analysts earlier this year. Nvidia reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in January. Revenue rose 78% to $39 billion on strong demand for data center hardware driven by the AI boom.Non-GAAP(generally accepted accounting principles) net income increase 71% to $0.89 per diluted share The only disappointment was an 3-point decline ingross margin, but CFO Colette Kress says that figure will rebound asBlackwell GPUsales ramp this year. Importantly, Nvidia is not immune to tariffs because most of its chips are made in Taiwan. However, the extent to which the company may be impacted is unclear because the Trump administration has not finalized duties on imported semiconductors. Nevertheless, Nvidia, with help fromTaiwan Semiconductor, recently started making chips in the U.S., and production will increase next year. Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 37% annually through fiscal 2027. That makes the current valuation of 44 times earnings look quite reasonable, especially because Nvidia beat the consensus estimate by an average of 10% in the last six quarters. Therefore, investors hoping to benefit from the AI boom should own shares. Amazon earns a little more than two-thirds of its revenue from the United States, but the company operates globally. It runs the largest e-commerce marketplace outside of China, it is the third-largestadtech companyworldwide, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud as measured by infrastructure and platform services spending. Amazon is well positioned for long-term growth because those three markets are forecast to expand quickly in the coming years. Through 2030, online retail sales are forecast to grow at 11% annually, digital ad spending is forecast to grow at 15% annually, and cloud computing sales are forecast to grow at 20% annually, according to Grand View Research. Amazon reported solid first-quarter financial results. Revenue rose 9% to $155 billion, andGAAPnet income jumped 62% to $1.59 per diluted share. But management gave cautious guidance. Second-quarter operating income is expected to land between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, which implies growth between negative 11% to positive 19%. The uncertainty is due to tariffs. Importantly, Amazon is not insulated from tariffs simply because it earns most revenue in the U.S.Morgan Stanleyanalyst Brian Nowak estimates 60% of third-party sellers have at least some exposure to China, and that Chinese sellers account for a significant portion of ad spending on the marketplace. But he also believes Amazon's global supplier network will still let the company offer online shoppers the lowest prices in many cases. Wall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 10% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look rather expensive, but analysts may be underestimating the company. Amazon beat the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 22% in the last six quarters, and I think that trend will continue as it leans on AI to boost revenue and efficiency across its business.",

        "content": "Few companies have benefited more from the artificial intelligence (AI) hype cycle thanNvidia(NVDA-1.02%), as it makes billions by designing the hardware needed to run and train these advanced algorithms. However, in recent times, the company has run into challenges as Chinese competition and international trade disputes weigh on investor optimism. Nvidia's shares are currently down by roughly 10% from an all-time high of $149 reached in January. But is this dip a buying opportunity or a signal for investors to stay far away? The company's first-quarter earnings report expected on May 28 will give us important clues about what the future might bring. The hardest part about being a winner is that everyone expects you to keep winning. Expectations are high, and it's easy to see why. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Nvidia's revenue surged by 78% year over year to $39.3 billion, driven by strong demand for its new Blackwellgraphics processing units(GPUs) designed to maximize the training speed of AI models. New product releases are a significant growth engine because, despite their high price tags (Blackwell chips are estimated to cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit), customers are still willing to shell out because better hardware can help them make money by allowing them to run greater workloads more efficiently and save on energy costs. Nvidia has leveraged its dominant market position to earn huge margins. Fourth-quarter profits surged 73% to $22.1 billion. However, while Nvidia's past performance is excellent, this level of growth might not last forever as the company begins running into increasingly challenging comps. Nevertheless, management remains optimistic for the future, guiding for first-quarter revenue of $43 billion (plus or minus 2%), which would exceed analyst expectations of $41.8 billion and represent a jump of 62% compared to the prior-year period. Despite management's optimism, Nvidia is not without long-term challenges. The company's guidance was released in late February before the Trump administration unleashed its \"reciprocal tariff\" policy, which has created significant uncertainty in global markets. Perhaps more importantly, guidance may not account for Nvidia's challenges in China. Image source: Getty Images. According to CEO Jensen Huang, the Trump administration's ban on sales of its H20 chips to China could eventually cost up to $15 billion in sales. And Nvidia expects a $5.5 billionimpairment chargein the first quarter to write down inventory and failed purchase commitments related to the product. With this in mind, Nvidia's first-quarter results may fall on the lower side of guidance or come in lower than expected. Over the long term, Nvidia remains committed to the Chinese market, which Huang believes represents a $50 billion annual opportunity. According to Reuters, the company plans to release a downgraded version of its H20 in China over the next few months. The company has also opened a research and development lab in Shanghai to stay competitive. This is a smart move as Chinese rivals such as Huawei take advantage of Nvidia's regulatory challenges to possibly chip away at its market share with AI chips of their own. With aforward price-to-earningsmultiple of 31, Nvidia goes into first-quarter earnings with a slight premium over theS&P 500average of 24. This valuation is relatively affordable, considering the company's strong growth rate and the continued excitement about the AI industry. That said, Nvidia faces some serious risks to the viability of its China business, and investors may want to wait until first-quarter earnings shed more light on the situation before considering a position in the stock.",

The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.  The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.  It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.  They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.  The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported.  The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.  An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its \"limited\" options. \"Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market.\"  TSMC declined to comment.  China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development.  After the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions.  Reuters was unable to determine the product's final name.  Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information.  According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant.  Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei which produces the Ascend 910B chip.  Huang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips.  The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales.  The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing.  Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of.  GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.",

I imagine nvidia earnings will be great, but outlook is the main problem, stock market is very future oriented. Trump has blocked more of nvidia sales to china, but also brokered more deals in the middle east. Tariffs also increasing prices etc.   My question is what do you think nvidia will report on their future outlook, positive, negative or both?   Currently ai is whats making the market go up, and nvidia is the current leader. If outlook is slightly negative, I believe the market will dump, if its really negative market is going to bleed badly.   Currently have 1 month out calls on Nvda, Smci, Mrvl. Will hedge with qqq puts closer to nvidia earnings. I believe nvda will have both positive/negative outlook news, but positive news greatly outweighing the negatives.",

        "header": "Why Stock Ownership Has Finally Returned to Pre-2008 Crash Levels",
        "content": "After 18 odd years, stocks are finally back in vogue. According to analytics company Gallup, 62% of Americans reported owning company shares in 2024 and 2025, a level previously not seen since 2007, the year the Great Recessionbegan. No reason for this upturn in stock market participation was given, but popular tech stocks delivering bumper returns, greater accessibility thanks to therise of online trading platforms, and increased access to employment-based retirement plans are likely factors. Since 1998, Gallup has been asking Americans once a year whether they owned stock in publicly traded companies, whether personally or with their spouse. That doesn\u2019t just mean directly owning shares in individual companies\u2014investments in mutual fundsor retirement savings accounts like a 401(k) or IRA also count. The readings were consistent during the poll\u2019s first decade, hovering around 60%. Thenthe Great Recession struck, the stock market crashed, many people lost their jobs and their savings, and trust in the financial sector was severely dented. Over the following decade, stock ownership remained well below the prior established norm of about 60%. It hit a low of 52% in both 2013 and 2016 and didn\u2019t bounce back to 60% until 2023.The number again reached 62% in 2024 and 2025, not far off the 63% record set in 2004. Multiple factors could cause stock ownership to fluctuate, includingmarket booms and busts, household finances, and access to employment-based retirement plans. So it's difficult to assign a rise or fall in stock ownership to any one factor. The shock of the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the market crash were likely factors in the decline in ownership in the following years. Many people also may have had to liquidate their accounts to meet expenses in the prolonged, painful recession that followed. In recent years, though, the percentage of employees withaccess to retirement planshas been climbing, from 54% in 2010 to 66% in 2024. The rise accelerated once certain part-time employees were granted the right to participate, which certainly helped drive overall stock ownership figures higher. So, too, therise of more accessible stock trading platformssuch as Robinhood, which offer the ability to buy fractional shares, making it easier and cheaper to trade stocks. More Americans are investing in stocks than at any point since 2007. A lot has happened since that date, including another market crash and recession, a long bear market, and an unprecedented period of low borrowing costs followed by rampant inflation. But perhaps the market's performance is most responsible for the rise in stock ownership. The S&P 500, which touched a record high in February 2025, is now nearly nine times higher than it was at the depths of the 2008 crash, and 2.5 times higher than it was at the lows reached during the 2020 COVID-19 crash. Those kind of gains tend to attract investors.",

The market began to focus on the 30-year Treasury yield. It was a quiet session and the S&P 500 closed slightly lower. Meanwhile, investors turned to gold as a safe haven and pushing price up around 2% to $3,300. \ud83d\udd34  \ud83d\udd38 Wednesday: Before the session, CNN reported that Israel may attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Gold prices rose again and passed $3,300. The stock market opened lower around 0.5% due to both 30-year Treasury yield and Israel attack. During the session, 30-year Treasury yield continued upper trend and back above 5.05%. It's highest level since October 2023. The stock market closed lower more than 1.5%. This is also the worst close so far in May. \ud83d\udd34  \ud83d\udd38 Thursday: After 2-day losing streak, the stock market opened flat. The 30-year Treasury yield hit 5.15% before easing. The House of Representatives passed Trump\u2019s tax and spending bill.

Before the session, Trump proposed a 50% tariff on European Union starting June 1. The future market reacted immediately and dropping more than 1%. He also stated that Apple should move production to the U.S. and he can add 25% tariff on them. The stock market opened lower more than 1%. During the session, Scott Bessent offered some optimism. He said several large trade deals will be announced in the next couple of weeks and the U.S. will resume in-person negotiations with China. This helped the market recover slightly, but the S&P 500 still closed lower more than 0.5% and extending losing streak to 4-day. Additionally, Fed's Goolsbee said that rate cuts are still possible in next 10-16 months due to uncertainty in trade policy. As of now, the stock market expects the earlist in September. \ud83d\udd34  Trump has remained silent on tariffs for a week and the stock market has been trending upward. On April 7, the S&P 500 hit the lowest level at 4,835.04 and then it had climbed at 5,968.61 on May 19. It gained over 20% in just a month.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is preparing to launch a new AI chipset for the Chinese market, priced significantly lower than its recently restricted H20 model, according to a Reuters report. The chip, part of the company\u2019s latest Blackwell architecture, is expected to enter mass production as early as June, the report added. The move signals Nvidia\u2019s effort to retain a foothold in China\u2019s $50 billion data center market amid tightening U.S. export controls on high-performance semiconductors. The report also added that the new GPU will be priced between $6,500 and $8,000\u2014well below the $10,000 to $12,000 range for the now-constrained H20 chip. This week, UBS analysts slashed their Nvidia estimates \"to reflect what may be a bigger impact from the H20 ban that we originally expected.\" While the new product is not yet finalized, and U.S. government approval is still pending, Nvidia\u2019s response highlights the growing complexity of serving a critical but increasingly restricted market. \u201cUntil we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China\u2019s $50 billion data center market,\u201d an Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters.

        "content": "As of the closing bell on May 20, the three major stock market indexes --S&P 500,Nasdaq Composite, andDow Jones Industrial Average-- are all essentially at break-even returns on the year. Under normal circumstances, mundane returns like these might have investors worried. But 2025 has been anything but normal. Over the last several months, financial news has been packed with storylines featuring the potential for a recession, mixed economic indicators, ongoing geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East, and (of course!) tariffs. At one point, each of the major indexes had dropped by double digit percentage points. The Nasdaq fared worst of all, declining by 21% at its low point. While the Nasdaq has bounced back considerably in recent weeks, some technology stocks are still trading for lower-than-usual valuations. Let's explore some of the biggest movers and shakers in the Nasdaq this year. From there, I'll take a look at valuation trends to help suggest if now is a good opportunity tobuy the dipin tech stocks. The chart below illustrates price returns for a number of different technology-themed investments, particularly in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.  QQQdata byYCharts Shares of theInvesco QQQ ETFhave gained roughly 2% on the year. This index fund tracks the Nasdaq-100 -- providing investors with exposure to a number of different AI stocks. Given this diversification, it's not surprising to see the Invesco QQQ outperform a number of individual volatile growth stocks this year. This leads me to the \"Magnificent Seven.\" For much of the last two years, it was pretty hard to lose money investing inMicrosoft,Nvidia(NVDA-1.02%),Amazon,Alphabet,Meta Platforms,Apple, orTesla. While timing mattered to some extent, these companies have largely become the de facto buys for AI investors. Yet this year, their respective performances have been far less predictable. Lastly, there'sPalantir Technologies. Despite a brief dip back in February,shares of Palantir have soaredto new highs -- making it one of the biggest outliers among popular AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images. An important thing to understand is that just because a stock might be outperforming its peers or the broader industry doesn't make it a smart buy. While I am bullish on Palantir, the company's valuation is stretched right now. In addition, even though shares of Tesla may appear deflated, the stock has beenexperiencing a lot of momentum as of late-- despite the company's financial picture looking pretty questionable. One pocket of the AI realm that has remained hot despite uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment is infrastructure. Companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, andOracleare spending hundreds of billions of dollars building data centers and outfitting these structures with the newest chip architectures. If I were considering AI stocks right now, I'd be looking at what companies stand to capture this infrastructure spend. Some of the more obvious names that come to mind are Nvidia,Advanced Micro Devices,Broadcom, andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Per the graphic above, each of these stocks is hovering around break-even levels on the year (essentially on par with the Nasdaq-100).  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts If you look at the forward earnings multiples for each of these companies, there is a clear pattern of compression throughout the year. However, more recent trends illustrate some resiliency -- as theforward price-to-earnings(P/E) multiples are beginning to climb ever so slightly. To me, this signals that some investors are buying the dip -- albeit cautiously. While it may take some time for these companies to begin showing accelerated growth again, secular themes fueling their respective areas of expertise in the AI market (i.e., hardware) suggest the long-run bull thesis holds up. Given how volatile the technology sector can be, it's important for investors to consider valuation before buying a growth stock. The key is to look for value and not chase momentum plays. Given the ideas explored in this piece, I do think now is a good opportunity to buy beaten-down AI stocks -- particularly in the semiconductor space.",

        "header": "Why Your Marital Status Could Influence Whether You Own Stocks",
        "content": "People who are married arefar more likely to own stocks, whether personally or jointly with their spouse, than single adults. The higher household income achieved with two paychecks is a big factor but it isn't the only one. Research finds that economic risk-sharing nudges married couples into the market while many singles remain on the sidelines. We explain below why being married means you're more likely to be in the market. According to Gallup\u2019s latest survey data, 77% of married Americans say they own stocks, individually or jointly with their spouse, whether directly or via mutual funds or retirement accounts. That compares with just 49% of single adults.Married couples are also far more likely to havetax-advantaged retirement accounts. What explains this gap? First, a married couple with two salaries likely enjoyshigher household earningsthan a single individual, and therefore, more money left over to invest. Crucially, having two salaries also reduces risk in one area of a married couple's economic life, enabling them to take on more risk via the stock market. Consider that if one partner loses their job, the other's salary will help carry them, making an unexpected layoff or medical bill less likely to burn through savings or force a fire sale of existing investments. That cushion encourages couples to openbrokerage accountsearlier and keep contributing through downturns. In fact, some economists see marriage as a sort of \u201csafe asset\u201d that lowers overall household risk, especially for women.Households became nearly ten\u202fpercentage points more likely to own equities within two years of marrying. Data also show that separated individuals pair that back again after divorce, suggesting the \u201cspousal safety net\u201d effect fades once the partnership ends. Even if one spouse isn't an investor, social learning is often at work: if the other is, it can bring them into the fold. Recent studies find that when one partner already has stock market experience, the other is far likelier to start investing after moving in together (and single men are more likely to be shareholders than single women).Research from Denmark also finds women\u2019s stock ownership climbs markedly after marriage, with men showing smaller but still positive shifts. But there are some caveats. Behavioral research indicates that single men tend to trade more aggressively\u2014sometimes to their detriment\u2014while married investors, particularly women, may under\u2011diversify by overweighting employer stock or keeping excess cash. Still, the overall direction of the evidence is clear: marriage raises stock market participation, and the couple\u2019s internal dynamics shape how much risk they ultimately take. With higher household incomes and psychological safety nets, marriage stacks the odds in favor of owning stocks. Singles can narrow the gap by automating contributions,building an emergency fund, and seeking outside accountability\u2014from a friend, financial planner, or even aroboadvisorapp\u2014to help replicate the risk\u2011sharing and information benefits couples naturally enjoy. In the end, relationship status should inform, but not dictate, your investing choices.",

        "header": "6 charts that capture Nvidia's AI-fueled rise",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sincethe launch of ChatGPTin late November 2022. Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp (VST). Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself asa cornerstone of the recent bull marketin stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years. Ahead of thecompany's next quarterly earnings release on May 28, we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market. There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's (INTC) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion. Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\"Magnificent Seven.\" The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today. Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets, citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players. As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%. Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips. From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%. Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022. In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

And today, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but some European stocks are currently experiencing explosive growth:  * On one hand, we have shares of major defense companies like **Rheinmetall**, which is becoming a kind of \u201cEuropean Nvidia\u201d in terms of stock market growth. We can also mention **Leonardo** or **Hensoldt**. Indeed, there\u2019s not only Germany\u2019s \u20ac1 trillion defense plan, but also the European Union\u2019s \u20ac800 billion investment plan. Among that, a \u20ac150 billion package was just approved. And beyond these pure defense players, there are also more generalist companies that are heavily exposed to the defense sector through their activities. * On the other hand, **small-cap stocks** are also on the rise. Several small caps are landing major contracts that are expected to double or even quintuple their revenues thanks to these investments. Why? Because they produce essential components or services that are in high demand in the defense sector. Moreover, the European plan emphasizes the involvement of small caps to benefit from the funding.  I personally hold stocks that have gained over **+40% in a single week** following the approval of the \u20ac150 billion plan, and the trend is still upward.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- European stocks climbed along with US equity futures after President Donald Trump extended a deadline on aggressive euro area tariffs, reinforcing a pattern of leaving markets guessing by making trade threats before backtracking. Most Read from Bloomberg NY Private School Pleads for Donors to Stay Open After Declaring Bankruptcy UAE\u2019s AI University Aims to Become Stanford of the Gulf NYC\u2019s War on Trash Gets a Glam Squad Pacific Coast Highway to Reopen Near Malibu After January Fires The Stoxx Europe 600 index erased Friday\u2019s losses sparked by Trump\u2019s threat of 50% tariffs on the European Union. The US President later said he had agreed to delay the date for the levies to July 9 from June 1. Contracts for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 advanced more than 1%. A gauge of the dollar hovered near its lowest level in almost two years. Cash Treasuries didn\u2019t trade due to holidays in the UK and US. The tariff war has returned as the major driver once again after concerns about Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts, and their impact on the US deficit, churned markets much of last week. Trump\u2019s whiplash moves have increased uncertainty in markets and his broadside against Europe on Friday, followed by a backtrack, was a stark reminder of the president\u2019s volatile policy making. \u201cThe stock market seems to dance to Trump\u2019s tune: first a threat, then a pullback, quickly followed by a rebound as speculative investors anticipate a concession from the U.S. President,\u201d said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. \u201cThis morning\u2019s confirmation of such expectations reinforces the so-called \u2018Trump Pattern,\u2019 which is increasingly seen as a successful strategy for risk-tolerant investors.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision to extend the deadline came after a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen, who heads the EU\u2019s executive arm, said earlier Sunday in a post on X that \u201cEurope is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,\u201d but \u201ca good deal\u201d will need \u201ctime until July 9.\u201d That\u2019s the date on which Trump\u2019s 90-day pause of his so-called reciprocal tariffs had originally been set to end. \u201cOne thing that is starting to concern us a bit is the fact that the rebounds that follow these selloffs are losing strength as we go on,\u201d said Frederic Rozier, a portfolio manager at Mirabaud France. \u201cWe can sense investor fatigue about this back-and-forth and there\u2019s a risk sentiment will erode as markets run in circles on tariffs. The only thing we know is that even if there\u2019s an agreement, there will be a cost for European stocks.\u201d Trump\u2019s tariff threats on Friday also included a 25% levy on smartphones if companies including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. failed to move production to the US. Among individual movers in Europe, Thyssenkrupp AG jumped more than 7% after a report that the firms chief executive plans to turn it into a holding company, allowing it to cut overhead costs as it divests further units. Volvo Car AB climbed as much as 4.8% after announcing plans to eliminate around 7% of its global workforce to cut costs and protect profits. The trade tensions and weak demand for US assets are showing up in the dollar. Bloomberg\u2019s dollar spot index was track for its lowest close since July 2023, while the greenback is at or approaching key levels against a host of currencies including the euro, Britsh pound, yen and Swiss franc. Enthusiasm has faded for the world\u2019s reserve currency this year. Speculative traders remained bearish on the dollar but trimmed their positioning to $12.4 billion in the week ending May 20 from $16.5 billion in the week prior, according to CFTC data reported Friday. A key event this week will be Nvidia Corp.\u2019s results on Wednesday. The chip-making giant is seen as a bellwether for so called growth stocks and the sustainability of the artificial intelligence boom. It\u2019s outlook will be crucial given macro risks and tariff uncertainty. Investors are also gearing up for the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the US personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, which will be released Friday. The April reading is forecast to rise 0.1% based on consensus expectations. Elsewhere, signs of port congestion in northern Europe and other hubs suggests trade wars could lead to maritime disruptions around the world, increasing shipping rates. Trump on Friday announced a partnership between United States Steel Corp. and Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel Corp., shocking markets with an agreement he said would keep the once-iconic American firm in the US, but otherwise providing no specifics. Nippon Steel shares jumped as much as 7.4% in Tokyo, while shares in US Steel rose 21% Friday.

        "content": "In May 2025, Moody\u2019s Corp. (MCO) lowered America's sovereign debt rating to Aa1, citing the $36.2 trillion debt pile, rising net interest costs, looming tax cuts, and political gridlock asfactors making fiscal course correction less likely. The cut aligns Moody\u2019s with S&P Global Inc.'s (SPGI)2011andFitch\u2019s 2023downgrades, ending America's triple-A status after more than a century. The ripple effects could affect everything from your 401(k) to the rate on your 30-year mortgage. Moody\u2019s gave the following reasons for the downgrade: Together, these could also cut the federal government's room to maneuver should there be a recession, creating what the agency calls a heightened \u201cevent risk.\u201d A lower credit rating means higher borrowing costs. After the downgrade,yields rose across the Treasury curve: the 10-year flirted with 4.6%, while the 30-year crossed 5% for the first time since late 2023.That pushed the average 30-year fixedmortgage back above 7%, the highest in five months.Credit-card APRs, auto loans, and private student loan rates\u2014most of which re-price off intermediate Treasuries\u2014will also tend to drift higher in tandem. Bond rates and their value move in opposite directions\u2014increasing rates also have a negative effect on bond prices\u2014so the fixed-income segment of your investment portfolio can see declines. But stocks, too, can take a hit as a result. The initial reaction to the downgrade saw major indexes drop, with the S&P 500 falling more than 1% in early trading before rebounding. The Moody's downgrade added to tariff-drivende-dollarizationfears. Treasury yields had already spiked andforeign investors questioned U.S. assetsas safe havens, leaving America more vulnerable to fiscal shocks as its debt burden grows. A one-notch downgrade doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. faces imminent default or problems borrowing. The dollar\u2019sreserve-currency statusstill gives Treasurys unrivaled liquidity. Yet the change reinforces a longer-term message:fiscal inertia is chipping away at America\u2019s creditworthiness, and markets will price in that risk rather than ignore it.",

The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[\u00a0a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)\u00a0in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.  Ahead of the\u00a0[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies \u2014 Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),\u00a0[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) \u2014 formed what would come to be known as the\u00a0[\"Magnificent Seven.\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)  The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[\u00a0three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.  As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.  From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.  Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.  In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.",

Marvell Technology\u2019s overall first-quarter revenues are likely to have benefited from improved performance across the majority of its end markets. The company\u2019s data center division continues to be the primary engine of growth, benefiting from the rising demand for electro-optics products, custom artificial intelligence (AI) silicon and next-generation switches. Our model estimates suggest that first-quarter data center revenues will reach $1.395 billion, implying a 2.1% sequential growth. The growing adoption of 800-gig PAM products and 400ZR data center interconnect solutions is fueling top-line expansion. Additionally, advancements in Compute Express Link technology and increased AI-related investments position Marvell as a key player in the high-performance computing ecosystem. Improved inventory corrections and recovering demand are helping Marvell\u2019s Networking and Carrier segments rebound. Our projections indicate that Enterprise Networking and Carrier revenues will each rise 8.1% and 9% sequentially, reaching $114.4 million and $186.9 million, respectively. Marvell Technology\u2019s carrier segment is benefiting from new design wins in cloud-driven networking solutions. As telecom providers upgrade their infrastructure for AI-driven applications, MRVL\u2019s networking division should continue to see steady improvements. The Automotive and Industrial divisions have been a consistent revenue contributor for Marvell Technology, thanks to the increasing semiconductor content in vehicles and industrial automation growth. For the first quarter, our model estimates for Automotive/Industrial revenues are pegged at $88.9 million, indicating a 3.7% sequential improvement. With automakers ramping up production of connected and electric vehicles, Marvell Technology's automotive ethernet solutions and advanced driver-assistance system technologies should continue to see steady adoption. Despite the strength of Marvell Technology\u2019s data center, networking and AI segments, its consumer end market remains a weak spot. Seasonality in gaming and broader macroeconomic uncertainty might have resulted in weak revenues in this segment. In the past year, MRVL shares have plunged 20.9%, underperforming the Zacks Electronics \u2013 Semiconductors industry\u2019s growth of 14.1%.

MRVL stock trades at a discounted price with a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 5.99X compared with the industry\u2019s 7.54X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Marvell Technology\u2019s custom silicon business is a game-changer, particularly in the booming data center market. Cloud service providers rely on their highly specialized chips to optimize AI computing efficiency, networking speed and energy consumption. Furthermore, Marvell Technology has also formed strong collaborations with industry leaders, includingNVIDIANVDA,Juniper NetworksJNPR andCoherent Corp.COHR, to design high-speed networking technology for AI workloads. Marvell Technology and NVIDIA have collaborated to integrate MRVL\u2019s optical interconnect solutions with NVIDIA\u2019s AI and computing technology. Using the NVIDIA HGX H100 eight-GPU platform, BlueField-3 DPUs, Spectrum-X networking, and Marvell\u2019s interconnects, they have developed NVIDIA Israel-1 to power AI applications with high efficiency. Marvell Technology has collaborated with Juniper Networks and Coherent Corp. to develop 800ZR networking solutions. Together, these companies combined Juniper\u2019s PTX10002-36QDD Packet Transport Router, Coherent\u2019s 800ZR transceiver, and MRVL\u2019s Orion 800G coherent DSP to develop a networking solution to support AI, cloud, and 5G. However, the U.S. government\u2019s recent steps toward China have also been a matter of concern for Marvell Technology as the company generates significant revenues (about 43% of its fiscal 2025 total revenues) from the Chinese market. As Marvell Technology owns research and development facilities in China and outsources to China, the growing geopolitical tension, fear of fresh sanctions and persistent tariff threats have added to investors\u2019 skepticism. However, given the MRVL\u2019s strong fundamentals, investors\u2019 concerns seem overblown. The recent U.S.-China agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other's goods can provide relief to Marvell Technology's business for the near term. Marvell Technology\u2019s upcoming quarterly results are likely to demonstrate the beginning of a multi-year growth story fueled by AI innovation. However, the company also suffers from the U.S.-China trade war as it highly depends on both nations. all these factors, we suggest that investors should retain MRVL stock at present.

Ahead of its quarterly release, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled several of the chipmaker'snew projects at the 2025 Computex conference in Taiwan, including humanoid robotics and the company's NVLink Fusion program to develop semi-customizable semiconductors for customers' AI infrastructure.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Nvidia earnings on tap next week, the 28th. Stacey, what are some of the the questions top of mind for you on that print? Yeah, you there's some near term worries just because of the China bans. You know they were banned from selling this H200 part in China which is meaningful. And it's it's I think I I saw an article just today that said Jensen had kind of sized it, you know, potentially $15 billion and you know that that's kind of in line with what what we had thought and, you know, I think they're supposedly trying to work around some of the new constraints and so it's very possible that some of that revenue comes back. But I mean does it impact in Q2? It it very clearly might. I I don't think that that'd be a shock at this point. I think that's anticipated. But I think some of the noise around China and near term is certainly a concern um and and a question. Um I think there's also some of the supply chain stuff that just this Blackwell transition has been challenging. It does look like they're in production. Jensen made some comments on that last night. So, but the ramp of Blackwell like into the end of the year and into next year I think will will be a a question. And then clearly is this stuff from the Middle East and maybe from other places starts to ramp over the next several years like how can that contribute? You know investors have been worried that 2025 could be a local peak for CAPEX. And I would say the only ones that have really been worried about that are investors. Like the companies that are actually spending the money don't seem to be worried. CAPEX budgets have actually been going up, not down. But to the extent that investors can get confident, there's still more growth to be had as we go forward. Um I think that's sort of like for the long-term thesis I think that's what's most important.",

        "content": "CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) has delivered edge-of-the-seat excitement for investors this year. A gravity-defying one-month gain of 145% in May has brought its YTD tally to around 160%, an impressive performance for a stock in the over $10 billion market capitalization bracket. Indeed, much of this rally has been news-driven (and not speculation), including Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) revelation of a 7% stake (as of March end) and a string of high-profile contracts. The latest being the $4.0 billion expansion deal with OpenAI, which already has an existing agreement with the company worth up to $12 billion, and the signing of a new hyperscaler client. But as Isaac Newton reminded us, what goes up must come down. After such a meteoric rise, some investors are asking the inevitable question: Can the rally continue or even sustain at these levels? Pat Burton, senior managing director at Winslow Capital Management, recently argued that the risk-reward is unfavourable for CoreWeave compared to more stable companies like Microsoft. That cautious view is gaining traction, even as the stock price scales new highs. According to a May 23 Bloomberg report, data from S3 Partners LLC shows that short interest in CoreWeave shares, as measured by the percentage of shares borrowed by short sellers, has surged from 18% in late April to 45% earlier in the week. Theoretically, this increased short interest could result in a short squeeze, in which short sellers are forced to buy additional shares to cover their positions as prices rise. But according to S3 Partners' analysis, a squeeze is unlikely to deter them as the market appears to have ample appetite to initiate new short positions. So, what\u2019s spooking some of these investors despite Nvidia\u2019s backing and rapid topline growth? The most prominent concern is CoreWeave\u2019s balance sheet leverage. The company is piling up massive debt at a relatively higher cost to fund its capital expenditure plans. Bloomberg notes that its debt-to-total assets ratio climbed to 54% by March 31, well above the 30% average of the Nasdaq 100 index. Another growing concern is whether AI demand is beginning to peak after some major tech companies have scaled back their investment in AI infrastructure, sparking fears that CoreWeave\u2019s growth may not be as sustainable as hoped. Among notable names that have made their cautious view clear is D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. Luria downgraded the stock to Underperform (May 15) with a price target of $36, when the stock was trading at around $66. In very blunt terms, he stated the business is not worth scaling because of its lower return on investment. Greg Miller from Citizens JMP, who recentlyinitiated coverage on CoreWeavewith a Hold rating, asked investors to be on the sidelines as the current risks are too high. As of May 23, data from CNN.com shows that 44% of analysts rate CoreWeave a Buy, 50% recommend a Hold, and 6% recommend a Sell on the shares. The consensus 12-month median price target is $67, implying a potential downside of around 35%. Finally, a key date for investors to watch is the lockup period expiry for CoreWeave on September 24, 2025. That\u2019s when the insiders will be free to sell their shares, and the free float will increase. This often tends to increase the trading volume and volatility of the stock. CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) provides AI developers and companies with cloud-based graphics processing unit (GPU) infrastructure, primarily based on Nvidia GPUs. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

While the company has outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) year-over-year, it has underperformed year to date as trade tensions create headwinds.

I'm executive editor Brian Sozzi and also the host of the opening big podcast. One of your favorite companies from the magnificent seven, of course, that's Nvidia, reports earnings this week and how the numbers shake out could dictate the next big move in the AI trade. Wall Street analysts are predicting another positive quarter of earnings growth fueled by demand for all things AI, but while Wall Street's feeling bullish, environmentalists have their concerns. And here's why. Nvidia is the world's most powerful chip maker with a market cap of more than 3 trillion dollars. But behind Nvidia's record revenues and profits is an overlooked cost. The environmental impact of chips powering the big AI boom. Nvidia holds about 80% of the AI chip market. Their GPUs or graphics processing units power things like ChatGPT, autonomous vehicles, and of course, video game graphics. The company designs the chips, then outsources manufacturing to foundries, also called fabs. The bulk of AI chip making happens in East Asia, and that's where energy use is absolutely surging. Fabs are energy intensive, and they're mostly powered by fossil fuels. For example, in Taiwan, over 80% of electricity still comes from coal, oil, and gas. Electricity use from AI chip making jumped more than 350% between 2023 and 2024, according to a recent report from Greenpeace East Asia. In Taiwan alone, the industry now consumes as much electricity as 93,000 Taiwanese households, says Greenpeace. Global electricity demand for AI chip making is estimated to reach nearly 40,000 gigawatt hours by 2030. That's more than the current total of Ireland's electricity consumption. And by 2027, AI electricity needs could be comparable to the current total of Argentina's electricity consumption, according to a recent study by the New York Times. Google, also a mag 7 member along with Nvidia, has said it will likely miss its climate targets due to increasing power demands of training AI models. The world's AI future is being built chip by chip, but as the industry scales, so does its environmental footprint. Keep that in mind as you read Nvidia's financial statements and earnings call later this week. With those profits, there is a cost.",

Take a look at this chart. It shows the median return on the stock depending on how long you hold it before the earnings report. Buying the stock just one day prior has a median return of 2.3%. Joining us now on this, Nancy Tengler, Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO. Nancy, always great to chat. How are you thinking about Nvidia ahead of its earnings report? Have you changed any of your positioning at all? Well, Madison, thanks so much to have, for having me, and happy Memorial Day weekend. Um, yeah, I, we added to the stock during the tariff turmoil. And so we picked it off at a pretty nice level and after dollar cost averaged our positions in. Um, but I still think you want to own this stock for the very long term. Uh, this is a company that's central to, to the AI revolution obviously. And what we've learned from the deep sea, deep fake, as I call it, is that, um, the, the hyper scalers in the US, US companies are doubling down on CAPEX and they are still investing at a really rapid clip. And so this is a name that I think you want to own and take advantage of if they do disappoint on margins and the market isn't expecting that, which is what we expect. What do you need to hear from Nvidia to clearly signal that the demand profile that they've continued to express to the street in quarters past is still there, and not just still there, but has even more room for growth even with some of the international implications that investors have had to factor in? Yeah, so, so Brad, I mean, I think that Jensen Huang announcing that they're opening up their platform is a head nod to, to the capacity constraint that we're hearing about from Microsoft and Amazon and, and that is we could have grown faster, uh, but for the fact that we couldn't get chips and there were, and, and there's an infrastructure, uh, issue. So I, I think we will, what I'd like to hear is that the company continues to innovate and they continue to, continue to adapt to, to the, the constraints, I'll say, that we're getting out of the administration. So we expect in the second half, you will see the new, the newly redesigned China chip adding to, to growth. And so I, I expect to hear a little bit about that. And then because costs, input costs are up, I'd like to hear something about, okay, if margins are in fact down, are they compressing overall or are they just, is this a short-term blip?",

        "content": "The AI gold rush is underway \u2014 but the industry's multibillion-dollar profits come at a steep cost: the environment. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings after market close on Wednesday, andhow the numbers shake outcould dictate the next big move for AI stocks. Wall Street analysts are predicting another positive quarter of earnings growth, driven by demand from companies aggressively building out AI infrastructure.Yahoo Finance data showsabout 87% of the analysts that cover Nvidia rate it a Strong Buy or Buy. \"Nvidia is the one chip player fueling the AI Revolution,\" Wedbush tech analystDan Ivestold Yahoo Finance. But while Wall Street pros are feeling bullish, environmentalists have concerns. Nvidia, which designs GPUs that power everything from ChatGPT to autonomous cars, outsources the manufacturing to foundries, or \"fabs.\" The company holds an estimated 80% of the AI chip market. The bulk of AI chipmaking happens in East Asia, where energy usage is surging. Fabs are energy-intensive, and they\u2019re powered mostly by fossil fuels. For example, in Taiwan, over 80% of electricity still comes from coal, oil, and gas. Electricity use from AI chipmaking jumped more than 350% between 2023 and 2024, according to a 2025 report from Greenpeace East Asia. In Taiwan alone, the industry now consumes as much electricity as 93,000 Taiwanese households, per Greenpeace. Global electricity demand for AI chipmaking is estimated to reach nearly 40,000 gigawatt-hours by 2030, notes Greenpeace. That\u2019s more than the current total of Ireland\u2019s electricity consumption. And by 2027, AI electricity needs could be comparable to the current total of Argentina\u2019s electricity consumption, according to a recent New York Times study. And while data centers stacked with Nvidia's powerful chips are necessary to train and use large language models like OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) ChatGPT or Meta's (META) Llama, they're also energy-intensive. Rival Alphabet (GOOG) has said it will likely miss its climate targets due to the increasing power demands of training AI. The world\u2019s AI future is being built chip by chip. But as the industry scales, so does its environmental footprint. Keep that in mind as you read Nvidia\u2019s financial statements and listen to Nvidia co-founder and CEOJensen Huangon the earnings call. Those profits have a cost, points out the World Economic Forum (WEF). \"To minimize the environmental impact of AI, it is crucial that the rapid expansion in data centres is powered by sustainable and responsible energy sources. The substantial financial investment in this infrastructure in some regions will not be affordable for most countries. Therefore, viable alternatives will be necessary, alongside strong collaboration among energy providers, environmental organizations, technology firms and governments,\" WEF warned in a white paper earlier this year.

Trump\u2019s comments were hislatest pushto ensure that Apple doesn\u2019t expand iPhone production in India as it shifts away from manufacturing in China, which faces among the highest import tariffs of U.S. trading partners. Apple's imports into the U.S. have so far escaped being hit since the Trump administrationexempted smartphones, computers and some other consumer electronic devices from \"reciprocal\" tariffs imposed in early April. Apple shares dropped 3% on Friday to around $195, losing ground for the eighth consecutive session.

        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips laid the groundwork for a massive wave of venture capital investments in AI startups. From the first quarter of 2023 \u2014 following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 \u2014 through the first quarter of this year, venture capitalists have invested $306.5 billion in global AI and machine learning startups and private companies, with $230 billion of that value going to US firms, according to PitchBook data. And over that time frame, AI and machine learning companies accounted for roughly 48% of the total venture capital investments in the US. \u201cChatGPT\u2019s breakout showed that large language models could scale into real products, which sparked a sharp rise in investor appetite,\u201d PitchBook AI analyst Dimitri Zabelin told Yahoo Finance in an email. \u201cNvidia played a central role by supplying the compute backbone.\u201d In the first quarter of 2025 alone, Zabelin explained, global VC investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning totaled $76.5 billion and accounted for over 70% of the value of all venture capital deals during the period. Some $66 billion of those investments were in US AI companies. Artificial intelligence has been around for decades, and AI researchers beganexperimenting with the use of Nvidia\u2019s GPUsin the early 2000s to power the technology, finding that it was more effective than \u201ctraditional\u201d computing chips called CPUs (central processing units). Then in2011and2012, AI computing models powered by Nvidia\u2019s AI-enabled GPUs began attracting widespread attention from both the academic community and Silicon Valley, includingSam Altman, whose startup OpenAI launched the chatbot ChatGPT in 2022 that brought AI mainstream. Nvidia shares have soared over 670% since the debut of ChatGPT, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s more modest 42% gain. \u201cAs GPU demand surged, it reinforced the view that AI represents a durable investment cycle,\u201d Zabelin said. According to Bloomberg estimates, Microsoft and Meta spend roughly 47% and 25% of their capital expenditures on Nvidia\u2019s chips, respectively, on an annualized basis. \u201cThat in turn set off a flywheel of product-market fit, infrastructure buildout, and accelerating capital flows,\u201d Zabelin added. Since the first quarter of 2024, more than 20,000 artificial intelligence deals have closed in private markets, totaling $330 billion. Nvidia is set to report quarterly earnings on May 28. Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to report soaring earnings and revenue for its fiscal 2026 first quarter (the April quarter), though they expect its growth to continue decelerating. Analysts project revenue will rise over 66% to $43 billion in the first quarter and adjusted earnings per share to leap 44% to $0.88. By comparison, in the first quarter of last year, Nvidia reported revenue rising a staggering 262% and earnings per share growing 461%.

        "header": "Tariff Negotiations Could Derail Nvidia's China Business. Here's Why I'm Not Worried About It.",
        "content": "On April 2, President Trump gave a commanding speech at the White House during which he outlined a plethora of new tariffs that would be applied to just about every country around the world. In the grand scheme of things, though, there are only a few geographic regions where the President really wants to rebalance trade relations. Chief among these countries is China. Over the last month and a half, semiconductor powerhouseNvidia(NVDA-1.02%)has been a tangential talking point as it relates to tariff negotiations with China. Let's explore why China is such an important market for Nvidia. Moreover, I'll outline a number of growth opportunities beyond the region and make a case for why I'm still confident in Nvidia's long-term prospects should its business in China begin to contract. Per Nvidia's latest 10-K filing, the company's revenue breakdown by geography is as follows: Data source: Investor Relations. From the figures above, it would appear that China makes up 13% of Nvidia's total revenue base. However, a footnote in the company's filings may offer a clue as to how much is really at stake here. Per the notes in the 10-K, \"Customers use Singapore to centralize invoicing while our products are almost always shipped elsewhere.\" Piggybacking off these details, there have been a number of reports that suggest much of Nvidia's products that are routed through Singapore end up in China. For the sake of this analysis, I'll lump Singapore and China together -- implying that up to roughly 31% of Nvidia's revenue could face some serious headwinds depending on the outcome of U.S. trade negotiations with China and how new policies could impact export controls. I'm not going to deny that Nvidia's exposure to China and neighboring countries isn't a risk. The silver lining I see from the financial profile above is that other regions of the world could emerge as new growth opportunities for Nvidia and perhaps eclipse the company's current business in China. Let's explore some recent developments involving Nvidia and other countries outside of China. Last week, President Trump traveled to the Middle East, and while over there, he helped forge some new deals that could be major catalysts for AI infrastructure players such as Nvidia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's (KSA) public investment fund runs a subsidiary calledHumain, which specifically focuses on making investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Per a recent announcement, Humain and Nvidia are partnering to build AI factories across the KSA. Humain will deploy \"several hundred thousand\" Nvidia GPUs over the next five years, with the initial phase comprising 18,000 of Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture. In addition, Reuters recently reported that a deal has been made between Nvidia andG42, a company located in the United Arab Emirates(UAE). Reports suggest that Nvidia will supply the UAE with 100,000 chips to build a new AI data center scheduled to be up and running as soon as next year. Of note is that Nvidia will be working withOracle,Cisco,SoftBank, and OpenAI as part of this infrastructure project, which is dubbed Stargate UAE. Image source: Getty Images. Depending on what happens with China, it very well could be the case that Nvidia's growth shows some signs of deceleration in the near term. However, I'm encouraged by the fact that some of the new deals with the Middle East are multiyear projects. This suggests that countries such as Saudi Arabia and others in the region are committed to AI infrastructure for the long haul, which should bode well for Nvidia down the road. But right now, compression in Nvidia'sforward earnings multiplecould suggest that investors are concerned about the company's future. I think this is primarily because people are focusing on the China situation.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts I think Nvidia is going to be just fine, regardless of what its prospects in China end up looking like. To me, the deals with Middle Eastern countries underscore how important Nvidia's chips are in the broader AI movement. Another way of saying this is that any business Nvidia might lose in China appears to be getting absorbed by other countries -- and I don't see these dynamics going away. Between its compelling valuation profile and various new relationships unfolding, I'm encouraged by Nvidia's prospects and see the stock as a no-brainer right now for investors with a long-run time horizon.",

        "header": "Amazon Just Sent a Massive Warning to Nvidia Investors",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-1.02%)has seen its sales soar on the back of a few big customers spending heavily to outfit data centers with as many of the chipmaker's GPUs as they can buy. Its top three customers accounted for 34% of sales last year. Amazon(AMZN-0.87%)is likely one of those big customers. Thecloud computinggiant spent over $93 billion in capital expenditures over the last 122 months, primarily focused on building out data centers for artificial intelligence (AI). That number will climb above $100 billion this year. While there's a lot of overhead, including buildings, server racks, networking equipment, and more, a good chunk of that spending goes to Nvidia for its leading-edge GPUs. But Nvidia's chips aren't the only ones Amazon uses in its servers, and the company just sent a signal that a competitor could be taking up more space in its data centers this year. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon was caught flat-footed as generative AI took off in late 2022, but it's invested heavily to catch up with its competitors ever since. It made a $4 billion investment in Anthropic early last year, and it added another $4 billion in November. The most recent deal included a strategic partnership where Anthropic will use Amazon's custom silicon for large language model training and inference. Amazon's custom AI chips are designed in partnership withMarvell Technologies. Marvell also makes networking chips and other data center chips among a broader silicon portfolio. Amazon made a small equity investment in the company in late 2021 well before it chose the chipmaker for its custom Trainium and Inferentia chips. Amazon recently made another AI investment. Its first-quarter 13F filing with the SEC revealed a purchase of 822,234 shares ofAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.25%). Those shares are worth about $90 million at today's price, which isn't a huge investment for a company generating tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow every quarter. However, that's still enough to make it Amazon's third-largest marketable equity holding in its portfolio. AMD is Nvidia's closest competitor when it comes to advanced GPUs. It's also the only companyIntelhas licensed to use its x86 CPU architecture, which is essential for Windows PCs and servers. The chipmaker is well positioned to gain market share on both fronts (GPUs and CPUs), and Amazon's equity investment could signal an acceleration in AMD's sales to the largest cloud computing company in the world. AMD CEO Lisa Su believes the AI accelerator market -- which includes GPUs and custom silicon solutions like Marvell's -- will grow at an average rate of 60% per year from 2025 through 2028 to reach $500 billion. While Nvidia will likely take the bulk of that spend, smaller companies are positioned to gain market share over that period with improved price performance. Not to mention, AMD and other chipmakers offer cloud providers a chance to diversify away from reliance on Nvidia, ensuring Nvidia's chip prices don't balloon out of control. Indeed, AMD recently struck a deal withOracleto deploy a cluster of 30,000 AMD MI355X accelerators, which helped push AMD's data center segment revenue 57% higher year over year in the first quarter. AMD's existing data center partnerships for its EPYC CPUs with all the hyperscalers put it in a great position to expand those relationships with its Instinct GPUs. On top of the opportunity in GPUs, AMD has become a leading provider of CPUs for cloud computing. That can be attributed to Intel falling behind in technological capabilities relative toTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, where AMD prints its chips. As a result, AMD can offer better price performance with its more power-efficient chips. With better CPUs and a competitive GPU lineup, AMD should continue to take up more and more real estate in the hyperscalers' data centers. Investors can buy AMD stock today for 27-timesforward earnings. That's a premium to the overall market, but a discount relative to Nvidia, which trades closer to 32-times earnings. That said, Nvidia continues to grow faster than AMD thanks to its pricing power and scale, so it may deserve a premium to AMD. Amazon very likely bought shares at a better valuation than investors can get today, but its stake in AMD is a strong indication that the chipmaker is continuing to make progress in gaining market share. Given AMD's solid CPU business and the upside potential of gaining share in the fast-growing AI accelerator market, the stock looks less risky than Nvidia at its current price.",
