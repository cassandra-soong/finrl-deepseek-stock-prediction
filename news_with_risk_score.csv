2025-03-15 17:55:00,The situation of the market,"Many stocks in the market are significantly overvalued‚ÄîTesla, Apple, Costco, Palantir, and much of the FMCG and pharmaceutical sectors, considering their sluggish growth. Even Nvidia could see its valuation tumble if China or AMD develop viable alternatives.

Market crashes don‚Äôt worry me; they‚Äôre necessary and often present great buying opportunities. What truly concerns me is the long-term effect of excess liquidity. Inflation is brewing beneath the surface, and we‚Äôll see its full impact in the years ahead. Over time, the velocity of money has declined while the money supply has surged, artificially propping up asset prices. My real fear isn‚Äôt a crash‚Äîit‚Äôs that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.

Bonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn‚Äôt a market for investors‚Äîit‚Äôs a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.

If inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins. After years of zero interest rates and relentless quantitative easing, my biggest concern is that when the real downturn hits, the Fed will have little ammunition left to respond.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc0xk4/the_situation_of_the_market/,5

üî∑ Apple dropped more than 10%.
üî∑ Nvidia surged nearly 8%. 
üî∑ Intel had a strong performance after announcing a new CEO and gaining over 16% in a week.

Overall, this week was negative.

Mar. 7, 2025 Closes,
üî∑ S&P500: 5,770.20
üî∑ Nasdaq: 18,196.22

üî∑ Nasdaq: 17,754.09 (-2.37%)
üî∑ DJI: 41,488.19 (-3.16%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;
Monday: Selling pressure was extremely strong. The Nasdaq dropped 727 points. It's biggest single-day decline since COVID crash on Mar. 16, 2020. üî¥
Tuesday: A quiet day. The stock market awaited key data releases on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. But, it's slightly negative. üî¥
Wednesday: CPI was released. The monthly estimate was 0.3%, but it came to 0.2%. The yearly estimate was 2.9%, but it dropped to 2.8%. This was perfect for stock market, because it's increased expectations of a rate cut. As a result, stock markets are surged more than 1%. üü¢
Tuesday: After CPI, PPI also came in below estimates. Core PPI turned negative (-0.1%) and the yearly dropped from 3.6% to 3.4%. However, tariff concerns created pressure and then the stock market dropped 2%. üî¥
Friday: The government shutdown reduced fears. The stock market jumped 2% to close the week on a strong. üü¢

S&P500 hit 6147 on February 19, 2025, but has now dropped to 5,638.94. The lowest level at this week was 5,504.65. That means, the index dropped slight more than 10%. S&P500 is below the 200-day EMA. 

If we can get 2 day consecutive positive close, some of money from other assets like gold may join the game into the stock market. For now, economic data supports the stock market, but we shouldn't forget that President Trump‚Äôs is more important than all the data and technical indicators.

There, I made an argument why markets were overpriced due to valuations and the actions of the current administration.

I am still worried, and I'm wondering what are the counter-arguments. 

1. Valuations are still high. 
2. Trump admin and Musk are pushing austerity via spending cuts/mass layoffs. 
3. Unstable tariff policy. Companies and consumers can't plan ahead. April 2 is coming. More chaos or clarity?
4. Soft data has been terrible. 
5. High-frequency and corporate data (travel, retail) all point to a rapidly deteriorating consumer. 

All of that makes me worried we are headed for a recession. Banks seem to agree and have upped their forecasts for one. Three months ago this would have been laughable. 

Granted, this can all change on a tweet. The trump team can pivot, make tariffs more clear & targeted, and Doge can become more work and less theater. Then, we can get to beneficial tax policies & deregulation.

I'm concerned that's not gonna happen. 

I'm concerned that Trump tariffs wont make companies move to the US & create jobs as Trump, Lutnick, and Bessent think they will. I'm concerned that people will get fired and become more poor, things will get more expensive, and Trump team will have nothing to show for it. 


Now, to positioning & stocks:

I've been buying things that will benefit from protectionist policies, like INTC and X. I've also bought the dip on several big tech names & then sold them on Friday after the rally. Why? Take Nvidia, for example. Great company, but if chips aren't excluded from tariffs, then Nvidia's profit margins would get slashed. So would the valuation.

I'm sitting on a lump of cash & am waiting for more clarity, whether it's up or down.

On the Nasdaq side, Tesla dragged the index down and dropped more than 6%. It recovered some losses by the end of the day.

2025-03-18 18:40:00,Nvidia announces Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin AI chips,"Nvidia announced new chips for building and deploying artificial intelligence models at its annual GTC conference on Tuesday. 

CEO Jensen Huang revealed Blackwell Ultra, a family of chips shipping in the second half of this year, as well as Vera Rubin, the company‚Äôs next-generation graphics processing unit, or GPU, that is expected to ship in 2026.

Nvidia‚Äôs sales are up more than sixfold since its business was transformed by the release of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT in late 2022. That‚Äôs because its ‚Äúbig GPUs‚Äù have most of the market for developing advanced AI, a process called training.

Software developers and investors are closely watching the company‚Äôs new chips to see if they offer enough additional performance and efficiency to convince the company‚Äôs biggest end customers ‚Äî cloud companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon ‚Äî to continue spending billions of dollars to build data centers based around Nvidia chips.

Tuesday‚Äôs announcements are also a test of Nvidia‚Äôs new annual release cadence. The company is striving to announce new chips on an every-year basis. Before the AI boom, Nvidia released new chips every other year. 

The GTC conference in San Jose, California, is also a show of strength for Nvidia. 

The event, Nvidia‚Äôs second in-person conference since the pandemic, is expected to have 25,000 attendees and hundreds of companies discussing the ways they use the company‚Äôs hardware for AI. That includes Waymo, Microsoft and Ford, among others. 

Nvidia will also showcase its other products and services at the event. 

For example, Nvidia announced new laptops and desktops using its chips, including two AI-focused PCs that will be able to run large AI models such as Llama or DeepSeek. The company also announced updates to its networking parts for tying hundreds or thousands of GPUs together so they work as one.

Vera Rubin

Nvidia said on Tuesday that it expects to start shipping systems on its next-generation GPU family in the second half of 2026. 

The system has two main components: a CPU, called Vera, and a new GPU design, called Rubin. It‚Äôs named after astronomer Vera Rubin.

Vera is Nvidia‚Äôs first custom CPU design, the company said, and it‚Äôs based on a core design they‚Äôve named Olympus. 

Previously when it needed CPUs, Nvidia used an off-the-shelf design from Arm. Companies that have developed custom Arm core designs, such as Qualcomm and Apple, say that they can be more tailored and unlock better performance.

The custom Vera design will be twice as fast as the CPU used in last year‚Äôs Grace Blackwell chips, the company said. 

When paired with Vera, Rubin can manage 50 petaflops while doing inference, more than double the 20 petaflops for the company‚Äôs current Blackwell chips. Rubin can also support as much as 288 gigabytes of fast memory, which is one of the core specs that AI developers watch.

Nvidia is also making a change to what it calls a GPU. Rubin is actually two GPUs, Nvidia said. 

The Blackwell GPU, which is currently on the market, is actually two separate chips that were assembled together and made to work as one chip.

Starting with Rubin, Nvidia will say that when it combines two or more dies to make a single chip, it will refer to them as separate GPUs. In the second half of 2027, Nvidia plans to release a ‚ÄúRubin Next‚Äù chip that combines four dies to make a single chip, doubling the speed of Rubin, and it will refer to that as four GPUs.

Nvidia said that will come in a rack called Vera Rubin NVL144. Previous versions of Nvidia‚Äôs rack were called NVL72.

Blackwell Ultra

Nvidia also announced new versions of its Blackwell family of chips that it calls Blackwell Ultra.

That chip will be able to produce more tokens per second, which means that the chip can generate more content in the same amount of time as its predecessor, Nvidia said in a briefing.

Nvidia says that means that cloud providers can use Blackwell Ultra to offer a premium AI service for time-sensitive applications, allowing them to make as much as 50 times the revenue from the new chips as the Hopper generation, which shipped in 2023.

Blackwell Ultra will come in a version with two paired to an Nvidia Arm CPU, called GB300, and a version with just the GPU, called B300. It will also come in versions with eight GPUs in a single server blade and a rack version with 72 Blackwell chips.

The top four cloud companies have deployed three times the number of Blackwell chips as Hopper chips, Nvidia said.

DeepSeek

China‚Äôs DeepSeek R1 model may have scared Nvidia investors when it was released in January, but Nvidia has embraced the software. The chipmaker will use the model to benchmark several of its new products.

Many AI observers said that DeepSeek‚Äôs model, which reportedly required fewer chips than models made in the U.S., threatened Nvidia‚Äôs business.

But Huang said earlier this year that DeepSeek was actually a good sign for Nvidia. That‚Äôs because DeepSeek uses a process called ‚Äúreasoning,‚Äù which requires more computing power to provide users better answers. 

The new Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin chips are better for reasoning models, Nvidia said. 

It‚Äôs developed its chips to more efficiently do inference, so when new reasoning models require more computing power at the time of deployment, Nvidia‚Äôs chips will be able to handle it.

‚ÄúIn the last 2-3 years, a major breakthrough happened, a fundamental advance in artificial intelligence happened, we call it agentic AI,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúIt can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem.‚Äù

2025-03-19 01:55:00,"Nvidia, GM announce deal for AI, factories and next-gen vehicles","General Motors and Nvidia have agreed to a strategic collaboration that includes the automaker using several products and artificial intelligence services from the tech giant for its next-generation vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems and factories.

The companies on Tuesday announced that the new initiatives include building custom artificial intelligence systems using Nvidia compute platforms, including ‚ÄúOmniverse with Cosmos,‚Äù for optimizing GM‚Äôs factory planning and robotics.

The Detroit automaker also said it will use ‚ÄúNvidia Drive AGX‚Äù for ‚Äúin-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences.‚Äù

GM declined to disclose a cost for the new tools with Nvidia. The tech company has been attempting to diversify its automotive business, which has notably included substantial work in data centers and GPUs.

‚ÄúThe era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we‚Äôre transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they‚Äôre made,‚Äù Jensen Huang, Nvidia founder and CEO, said in a release. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to partner with GM to build AI systems tailored to their vision, craft and know-how.‚Äù

GM has been using Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, for training AI models across various areas of its business, including simulation and validation. The new business expands to in-vehicle hardware, automotive plant design and operations, the companies said.

The automaker also had been testing Nvidia‚Äôs Omniverse since at least 2022. Some of GM‚Äôs testing was in designing a ‚Äúdigital twin,‚Äù or replica, of its new design center and processes to assist virtual vehicle development. It also acted as a single digital environment for employees to work and collaborate in, according to a video last year featuring GM for Nvidia‚Äôs GTC developer conference in 2023.

Nvidia anticipated it would strike a deal with GM mid-last year for Omniverse, according to an internal company email viewed by CNBC. At that time, two sources with GM signaled the automaker wasn‚Äôt sure Nvidia‚Äôs software and GPUs were worth the high cost compared with other companies.

It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear what sealed the deal for GM. But since that time, both companies have experienced increased¬†competition from China¬†and uncertain regulatory changes such as tariffs. GM‚Äôs stock is off roughly 8% during in 2025, while Nvidia is off about 12% this year.

‚ÄúAI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,‚Äù GM CEO¬†Mary Barra¬†said in Nvidia‚Äôs release. ‚ÄúBy merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.‚Äù

The companies announced the new initiatives in connection with Nvidia‚Äôs¬†GTC AI conference¬†this week in California.

Nvidia describes Omniverse as a platform for ‚Äúdeveloping and deploying physically based industrial digitalization applications.‚Äù It‚Äôs essentially connecting a physical environment with a digital, or software, world to optimize processes using a ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù of a physical environment such as a GM design facility or plant.

Users of Nvidia‚Äôs Omniverse have included BMW,¬†Amazon¬†Robotics and Samsung,¬†Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology, said during a media briefing a year ago. He said the company was licensing Omniverse for $4,500 per GPU, per year.

It‚Äôs unclear how many GPUs GM will need. But given the amount of robotics, sensors and other systems needed to operate a modern assembly plant, it would likely be quite a bit.

More than¬†20¬†other automakers have used Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúsystem on a chip‚Äù hardware in the central computing units of their smart vehicles, including Mercedes Benz, Volvo, Audi, Volkswagen and BYD, according to an industry equity research note from Jeffries in November 2023.

In recent years, Nvidia has seen soaring demand for its GPUs, which are used for everything from bitcoin mining to AI inference and training.

2025-03-19 05:55:00,Trump‚Äôs Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I‚Äôm Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I‚Äôve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves‚Äî25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy‚Äîecho his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

‚Ä¢ **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed‚Äôs job harder.

‚Ä¢ **China‚Äôs response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**‚Äîthis could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

‚Ä¢ **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it‚Äôs still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** ‚Äì Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** ‚Äì ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** ‚Äì If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** ‚Äì If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** ‚Äì Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** ‚Äì Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** ‚Äì Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** ‚Äì If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I‚Äôm watching:**

üìå Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

üìå Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

üìå Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

üìå Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

2025-03-20 18:52:00,Nvidia CEO Says He Was Surprised That Publicly Held Quantum Firms Exist,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he didn‚Äôt realize there were publicly traded quantum-computing companies when he made earlier comments that caused industry stocks to crash.

‚ÄúMy first reaction was, I didn‚Äôt know they were public. How can a quantum company be public?‚Äù Huang said at an event Thursday focused on the still-nascent technology.

The executive had said in January that ‚Äúvery useful‚Äù quantum computers are probably decades away, causing shares of IonQ Inc. and other companies to tumble. Thursday‚Äôs event ‚Äî part of Nvidia‚Äôs weeklong GTC conference ‚Äî invited some of those very companies on stage to discuss their prospects with Huang.

The quantum-computing industry aims to use the unique properties of subatomic particles to process data much faster than traditional semiconductor-based electronics. The technical difficulties of building practical systems have meant that the field is still in an experimental stage. In addition to quantum upstarts, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google are also trying find practical uses for quantum systems.

The companies on stage at Thursday‚Äôs event included IonQ and D-Wave Quantum Inc. Huang said it was natural for this new form of computing to take many years to develop since it was so novel. The companies might be able to convince him that quantum computing is happening more quickly than he expected, he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he joked.

‚ÄúThis whole session is going to be like a therapy session for me,‚Äù he said.

The six company leaders on stage gave him a variety of answers. Some argued that quantum computers are already in use to solve difficult science problems. Others posited that the technology is even closer to helping advance traditional computing.

Executives also said it wasn‚Äôt unreasonable to spend a decade honing a technology that will have such a large impact. Loic Henriet, who runs the French company Pasqal, argued that the term ‚Äúquantum computing‚Äù was misleading. Quantum processors will help act as accelerators ‚Äî working alongside traditional computers ‚Äî rather than replacing them, he said.

2025-03-21 00:54:00,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven ‚Äî which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) ‚Äî is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

Don‚Äôt ever get shaken out of your conviction. In trading and life. Tough lesson here but I had to exit this trade due to life circumstances after holding Nvidia for 3 years in sideways action.  I believe these shares would be the equivalent of about $0.43 after splits.

  
I knew the potential of Nvidia in the 90s/early 2000s when I was in high school. I was building gaming computers with their chips after them taking over 3dfx (Voodoo line). My thought was if the GPU is the most important element for gaming and being able to do rapid fire complicated calculations, what is the end game for Nvidia? Well, we know the rest of the story of where that led. So, in 2011 when I started really learning about the stock market, I bought shares and just held it. I had to sell due to a large purchase and at the time, was money better utilized as the frustration of holding no movement in either direction finally got to me.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jha3wo/a_nvidia_trade_from_2011_that_became_one_of_my/,3

Over the last two days, I rolled 30 of 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps (cash secured puts) to NVDA 5/16 120 csps and received an additional $11k premium. Wrote another 30 NVDA 5/16 110 csps for $9k premium. Altogether 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps and 30 NVDA 5/16 120 csps for a total of $35k premium. I picked the expiration to be one week before earnings so the premiums are not inflated by earnings and I would like to have the option to make another earnings play if the price is around $120.

After factoring in premiums, the average cost to purchase is $105 and $115 respectively. I picked $110 and $120 because NVDA‚Äôs lower range is around $110 and upper range is around $140, so in the worst case (of my) scenario, I would be purchasing NVDA at the lower end of the range. If I‚Äôm wrong, then NVDA is a good stock to hold long term.

I don‚Äôt need to bore anyone to list all of the reasons NVDA is a buy including exploding need and revenue from data centers; just beginning to scratch surface on AI in automobiles/partnership with AI companies; growing domestic revenue (47% 63B revenue) that won‚Äôt be impacted by AI restrictions‚Ä¶

Worst case scenario, NVDA tanks below $110 and I am forced to buy 7,000 more shares. In that case I will just hold on to a stock that I am confident will double in 5 years. Best case scenario for me is if the price remains in the 129 range and I will get to write puts again (6th time) and continue to collect premiums.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jkbugr/nvda_110_and_120_516_cash_secured_puts_6th_time/,3

Micron (MU) and Samsung for flash storage (NAND SSDs).

NVIDIA (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) for GPUs and CPUs powering AI workloads.  Nvidia obviously gets all the attention right now.

Arista Networks (ANET) and Broadcom (AVGO) for network hardware.

Supermicro (SMCI) for custom-built servers.

2025-03-28 03:07:00,"CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)","# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).

CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an ‚ÄúAI hyperscaler.‚Äù They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.

CRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services‚Äã. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.

CRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.‚Äã Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver‚Äã.

Companies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past‚Äã. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called ‚ÄúSUNK‚Äù and an optimizer ‚ÄúTensorizer‚Äù) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.

In practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.

**The NVDA Relationship**

NVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.

**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**

Kind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9‚ÄØB for GPU cloud capacity‚Äã. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. 

**The Financials**

CRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8‚ÄØM (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.

By 2024, CRWV neared $2‚ÄØB in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.

The financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \~$600M, and in 2024m \~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).

The S-1 shows operating costs close to \~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.

The cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.

**Customer Concentration**

In 2023, Microsoft accounted for \~35% of CRWV‚Äôs revenue‚Äã. In 2024, that grew to \~62% of total revenue‚Äã. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).

**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.

However, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030‚Äã, which averages out to \~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV‚Äôs revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Beyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.

**IPO Technicals**

CRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation‚Äã. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.

**Valuation/Comparables**

Is a \~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:

|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92‚ÄØB|\~$20B (target IPO)|\~10√ó|
|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41‚ÄØB‚Äã|\~$52‚ÄØB (market cap)|\~15√ó ‚Äã|
|**Databricks**\*|\~$3‚ÄØB by end of 2025|\~$62‚ÄØB ‚Äã|\~20√ó|
|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6‚ÄØB‚Äã|\~$500‚ÄØB|\~4-5√ó|

(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \*Also note that Databricks is a private company

I think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3√ó growth for a couple more years), then an 10√ó multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \~$4‚ÄØB+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.

CRWV‚Äôs valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**

This valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.

**IPO Trading Details**

37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).

Overall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.

**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.

Coreweave managed to skyrocket into the headlines over the past couple of years after solidifying its position as a significant AI player. This parabolic rise was, in part, thanks to a $2.3b loan collateralized by NVDIA GPUs. However, a simple google search of the collateral posted for this loan, Nvidia H100 tensor core gpu, will likely lead you to the same conclusion illustrated below.

When Coreweave secured an initial $2.3b in cash from investors, they posted NVDA chips as collateral. The rapid cash injection buoyed them onto the AI scene relatively quickly. However, that form of collateral has proven itself to be less than fundamentally sound over the past couple of years.
*Source: (https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/)*

When Coreweave posted the NVDA chips as collateral in 2023, the value was marked-to-market at ~$47,000/processor. That same processor is now worth 30% less. For context - their total loan value came in at a whopping $7.6 billion near the end of 2024. Simply put: technology is advancing quickly, and the collateral is rapidly degrading in value. Additionally, the cost to rent these GPUs is falling - why own the asset when you can rent it for 1/100th the price?

In December of 2024, Coreweave breached terms of their $7.6b loan through various ""unspecified"" actions and ""accidents"". However, their primary lender Blackstone was generous enough to waive these shortcomings and amend their loan.
*Source: (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1015.htm)*

Wildly enough, the cause of the near technical default was found to be due to an overstatement of collateral - Coreweave was alleged to not have tangibly held as many GPUs as they reported. The ""administrative accident"" was Coreweave attempting to sure-up it's reserves as to avoid defaulting on it's obligations.

That same company, ""backed"" by NVDA, will now IPO tomorrow. At $40 per share, the implied value is $19b. As it stands today, that $7.6b loan (that they nearly defaulted on 3 months ago) is nearly 1/2 of their entire market cap.

Just keep that in mind before smashing that buy button tomorrow after the buffer period.

Mar. 24, 2025 - Mar. 28, 2025","First of all, I don‚Äôt want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 21 to Mar. 28. This week,

üî∏ Tesla gained 5.93%. The auto tariffs had no impact due to the U.S based production.

üî∏ Ford fell 2.7% and General Motors dropped 6.27% about concerns over supply chains.

üî∏ Berkshire closed slightly positive in the negative conditions. The investors believe Buffett.

üî∏ Semiconductors had significant loses on Wednesday. It's selling pressure on the Nasdaq and the stock market.

Mar. 21, 2025 Closes,

üî∑ S&P500: 5,667.56

üî∑ Nasdaq: 17,784.05

üî∑ DJI: 41,985.35

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,

üî¥ S&P500: 5,580.94 (-1.52%)

üî¥ Nasdaq: 17,322.99 (-2.59%)

üî¥ DJI: 41,583.90 (-0.95%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

üî∏ Monday: The rising continued from the previous week. The indexes broke a 4-week losing streak. The S&P 500 gained over 1.5% and it reached highest rising level for the week. üü¢

üî∏ Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited key data releases on Wednesday and Friday. Consumer Confidence released at 92.9 and its lowest level since February 2021, but it had not impact. The indexes closed slightly positive and extended winning streak to 3-days. üü¢

üî∏ Wednesday: Trump announced new tariff plans for automotive imports. It triggered heavy selling pressure. The indexes lost around 1.5%. üî¥

üî∏ Thursday: The day started with GDP report which decreased from 3.1% to 2.4% (better than the expected 2.3%). There was nothing extra thing and the indexes closed slightly lowered. üî¥

üî∏ Friday: The most important data of the week was PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure). Core PCE was expected at 2.7% YoY, but it exceeded expectations at 2.8%. The PCE is came matched with the expectations. It's 3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. I think, the more important data was 1-year Inflation Expectations. It came 5% and highest value since November 2022. As a result, the indexes lost more than 2%. It was rough day. üî¥

Meanwhile, gold gained over 2% and silver surged more than 3%. Do you invest in them? I bought gold around 2300 and still hold it.

2025-03-31 08:45:00,Will the stock market be in a bearish trend? Probably we will see in this week.,"The debate over whether U.S. stocks have entered a bear market is intensifying. Historically, a pullback of¬†**less than 10%**¬†is seen as a ""healthy correction within a bull market,"" a¬†**15% decline**¬†signals a ""correction phase,"" while a¬†**20%+ drop**¬†typically marks a ""technical bear market.""

The S&P 500 has retreated approximately¬†**10%**¬†from its peak, hovering at a critical juncture. This week‚Äôs performance will be decisive: If this is merely a healthy correction, markets should rebound strongly and reclaim new highs soon. However, futures markets suggest diminishing odds of such a scenario:

* **Nasdaq futures fell 1.2%**¬†amid reports that Trump is pressuring advisors to escalate tariffs, raising fears of a U.S.-led global trade war.
* **Geopolitical risks surged**¬†after Putin‚Äôs armored convoy exploded in central Moscow, potentially worsening Russia-Ukraine tensions.
* **April 2nd**¬†looms as the deadline for the U.S. to unveil new tariff policies, amplifying market anxiety and safe-haven demand.

Amid this uncertainty, Citi outlines three scenarios:

1. **Reciprocal tariffs only**¬†‚Üí Limited market impact.
2. **Reciprocal tariffs + VAT adjustments**¬†‚Üí U.S. dollar could rally 50-100 basis points, pressuring equities.
3. **Reciprocal tariffs + VAT + sector-specific tariffs**¬†‚Üí Deeper equity market correction.

Gold has emerged as the top safe-haven play, while short-term traders are bidding up volatility. ORATS data shows¬†**elevated near-term implied volatility premiums**, signaling investors are pricing in immediate risks.

**Will April 2nd Trigger a Crash?**

A common question in trading communities reflects market sentiment:¬†*‚ÄúIs now the time to long VIX? Should I enter on March 31 or April 1?‚Äù*

But Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett argues the real inflection point may be¬†**April 4th‚Äôs nonfarm payrolls data**. Strong jobs numbers could fuel a rebound, while weak data might push the S&P 500 lower. Hartnett emphasizes that¬†**macro fundamentals**, not short-term policy noise, will ultimately drive markets.

**Technical Analysis: Key Support Levels**

Historically, the¬†**50-week moving average (MA)**¬†has acted as a floor during past corrections. The S&P 500 recently breached this level. A¬†confirmed close below the 50-week MA¬†this week‚Äîespecially if sustained‚Äîwould signal a bearish regime shift, with the next major support at the¬†**200-week MA**.

Savvy investors know:¬†**Trend confirmation is key**. Opportunities exist in any market:

* **Bull market**: Buy dips in tech titans or undervalued growth stocks. e.g. META, GOOGL, AAPL, AIFU, NET, DOCN, IT, ACN, NVDA, TSLA, ACVA, MA, QTWO, DDOG
* **Bear market**: Short overvalued growth stocks.

The HR industry could benefit from it to an extent, but only with intense moderation at first. This eventually will transform the type of jobs available, one of which will be something of the sort of AI moderators.

The most important topic in this month is tariffs which will continue to discuss in the next month. Additionally, concerns about AI, recession fears, and mixed economic datas on the negative side. Occasionally, we had made jumps like government shutdown. In summary, the market faced multiple negative factors and dropped more than 5% in a single month. Today started with selling pressure and hit the 5,488.73. If the index does not recover, we may be looking at more negative month. 

As I mentioned in the title, The S&P 500 extended its losing streak to 2-months. Let's look at the numbers:

Sep. 30 close at 5,762.48 - Oct. 31 close at 5,705.45 üî¥ (-0.99%)

Oct. 31 close at 5,705.45 - Nov. 29 close at 6,032.38 üü¢ (+4.68%)

Nov. 29 close at 6,032.38 - Dec. 31 close at 5,881.63 üî¥ (-2.50%)

Jan. 31 close at 6,040.53 - Feb. 28 close at 5,954.50 üî¥ (-1.44%)

Feb. 28 close at 5,954.50 - Mar. 21 close at 5,611.90 üî¥ (-5.75%)

The stock market story is fully negative for now. However, gold and silver have jumped over 9% this month. The stock market had been shining in 2024. It had made a strong rally.

Dec. 29. 2023 close at 4,769.83 - Dec. 31. 2024 close at 5,881.63 üü¢ (+23.3%)

January started strong, but that momentum has turned. The market needs a new factor for an uptrend, such as decreasing inflation, rate cut, or something. How was your month? Did you catch any winners like Berkshire or stocks in the Health Care sector? What are your thoughts on the next month?

Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate.

The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months.

The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022.

The index‚Äôs first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year‚Äôs gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the ‚Äúmagnificent 7,‚Äù have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year.

The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia‚Äôs late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1joht47/stocks_close_out_their_worst_quarter_since_2022/,4
2025-04-01 02:40:00,Tariffs on Tech,"***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*

***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  


On April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for ""rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America"". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/azbupva7p4se1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=38847b3d9ae4e0c455639abd44c036e1ec923be9

  
***THE POINT:***

  
In 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called ""electronic transmissions"" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the ""internet"".**

  
This ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  
This moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:



[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)

In the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.

  
This framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to ""strike back"":***

***THE PROBLEM:***

Nearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. ""services"" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). 

The problem, then, is derived from the following:

[\>50&#37; of the revenue of the S&P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)

NVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.

***The Endgame:*** 

The tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **->** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **->** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **->** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \~50% of all U.S. spending

2025-04-01 15:01:00,China‚Äôs 5nm Chip Breakthrough ‚Äì Is NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock at Risk?,"China‚Äôs semiconductor industry is making waves with its 5nm chip development, potentially disrupting the global market. Could this be bad news for NVIDIA (NVDA)? Here‚Äôs what investors should know:

Why This Matters for NVDA

Market Share Threat ‚Äì  Chinese firms (e.g., Huawei, SMIC) successfully mass-produce competitive 5nm chips, NVIDIA‚Äôs dominance in AI/data center GPUs (especially in China) could weaken.

US-China Tech War ‚Äì Export restrictions (A100/H100 bans) already hurt NVIDIA‚Äôs China revenue (\~20% of sales). A viable Chinese alternative would make things worse.

Competition Heats Up ‚Äì Huawei‚Äôs Ascend and other domestic chips are closing the gap in AI performance.

Potential Stock Impact

Short-term: Sentiment-driven dip if markets overreact to ""China threat"" headlines.

Long-term: Depends on whether NVIDIA can out-innovate (e.g., next-gen Blackwell GPUs) and retain non-China demand (cloud/AI boom)

Bottom Line: A real risk, but NVIDIA‚Äôs tech lead and global AI demand might cushion the blow. Would you buy the dip or stay cautious?

Discussion Points:

Is China‚Äôs 5nm chip a real competitor, or just hype?

2025-04-02 06:47:00,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Hidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/,3
2025-04-02 14:02:00,Nvidia-backed CoreWeave is the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021,"We've got a fresh IPO that just hit Nasdaq last Friday and options already trade on this! CoreWeave / $CRWV is a Nvidia-backed cloud AI services provider. $CRWV is one of the first pure-play AI IPOs, offering AI technology in the cloud. It's backers: Nvidia, Fidelity, and Magnetar. Nvidia even anchored the IPO with a $250 million order. 

Financials: CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion in its IPO, the most for a U.S. tech offering since 2021. Revenue last year was $1.92 billion, up 737% from the year before. Growth is undeniable, but there's also a net loss of $863 million reported last year. (D'uh).

Strong Customer Base: Microsoft, Meta, IBM, and Cohere are all customers. Microsoft alone accounts for 62% of CoreWeave's revenue.

The IPO priced below the expected range, opening at $39 and closing at $40. Friday was a shitty day (-3% nasdaq) to IPO.

So, what's the play?

This isn't a short-term YOLO imho, IV is so high it's only good for writing puts. Shares for me, but you do you. Also do your own DD, obviously. Current market price is still kinda close to IPO range.

Positions: 500 shares @ about $54. IV is 170% for April, so good luck if you buy options on this, you'll need it.

Well, here we go again. Trump just dropped a massive tariff plan, and the market is in full panic mode. A 10% baseline tariff across the board, plus brutal rates on China (54% effective!), the EU (20%), Vietnam (46%), and Taiwan (32%). The result? Dow futures tanked nearly 1,000 points, the S&P 500 is down big, and tech stocks are getting destroyed. Apple and Tesla? Down 7%. Nvidia? -5%. Even retailers like Dollar Tree and Gap are getting hammered.

If this feels like a rerun of 2018-2019, that‚Äôs because it basically is‚Äîbut worse. Back then, the trade war rattled markets, hurt supply chains, and slowed global growth. Now? We‚Äôre already dealing with sticky inflation and a shaky economy. Traders were hoping for some stability, but instead, they got another wildcard move. (trolling a bit, The market will bounce back sooner or later!)

The real gut punch is China‚Äôs 54% tariff rate. That‚Äôs not a slap on the wrist‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-blown economic war. European stocks are taking a hit too, especially companies like Adidas (-8.6%) and Volvo Cars (-9%). The global reaction is clear: this isn‚Äôt business as usual; this is escalation.

Now the big question: what‚Äôs next? If China and the EU retaliate, things could get uglier fast. The market hates uncertainty, and this is serving it up on a silver platter.

Are we looking at another 2019-style rollercoaster, or is this just an overreaction? Buckle up‚Äîthings are about to get wild. What‚Äôs your take?

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[¬†reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html)¬†the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India ‚Äî all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important¬†[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[¬†like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.¬†[So if this tips us into recession,¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/,4

But I don't think fabless chip designers really have any options outside of TSMC for cutting edge chips, so at least in the short to medium term I don't see designers flipping to other fabs. 

ASML is another one, unless these tariffs absolutely tank demand for chips (which is certainly plausible), I don't see much impact to them because there are no other alternatives

LIVE UPDATES

U.S. markets suffered their steepest declines since 2020 on fears President Trump‚Äôs new tariff plans will trigger a global trade war and drag the U.S. economy into recession.

Major stock indexes [dropped as much as 6%](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/wall-street-faces-toughest-test-in-years-49174a8b) on Thursday. Stocks lost roughly $3.1 trillion in market value, their [largest one-day decline](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/u-s-stocks-are-headed-for-biggest-wipeout-in-market-value-since-march-2020-VKjYNvHUTrb8kS0D0mG1) since March 2020. Stock-index futures drifted lower Thursday evening, and [stocks in Japan](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/asian-markets-extend-declines-in-wake-of-wall-street-s-plunge-iAuC1BOJfjkdS73r4WBN) were hit for a second day as Friday trading began.

In Thursday's market plunge, the Dow industrials dropped 1679 points, or 4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which powered the market higher for years, was down 6%, pulled lower by big declines in Nvidia, Apple and Amazon.com. The S&P 500, which fell 4.8%, and the other benchmarks suffered their sharpest declines since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The dollar meanwhile tumbled, with the WSJ Dollar Index [suffering its sharpest decline](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-tariffs-us-dollar-217b3dc9) since 2023. The 1.3% fall brought the greenback to its lowest level since October, a sign of unease over the growth outlook and fears that the flow of funds into the country will be sharply curtailed.

Fears that the tariffs will tip the economy toward recession sent investors to the safety of Treasurys. JPMorgan analysts raised their forecast of [the likelihood of a recession](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/jpmorgan-raises-recession-risk-to-60--clWSymXLSyvXZ7fPu6g6) to 60% after the new tariffs were announced.

Some of America‚Äôs allies came out swinging after the details of the U.S. president‚Äôs tariff plans were disclosed late Wednesday. French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe [is weighing retaliation](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/macron-suggests-retaliation-against-u-s-tech-services-for-trump-tariffs-DUYsoG9KHWwS7r6VgwAM) against U.S. tech firms, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country [will match](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/canada-to-hit-u-s-autos-with-retaliatory-tariffs-CH1c2YbcTCDFfbrALCzO) President Trump‚Äôs auto tariffs with 25% tariffs of its own.

Trump took the selloff in stride. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going very well,‚Äù Trump said in response to a question about his tariffs Thursday afternoon. ‚ÄúThe markets are going to boom.‚Äù He left the door open [to making deals](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/trump-on-whether-he-d-make-a-deal-on-tariffs-it-depends--oZod5dqUDqzjtDCuyymX) to lower tariffs, while also [promising new ones](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/trump-previews-chip-pharma-tariffs-q1WBoRT9sCDkcPGkVNlU) on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.

Dozens of household-name stocks posted double-digit declines, including HP, Nike and Target. Stellantis also fell sharply. The Jeep maker said it is [temporarily halting production](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/jeep-maker-stellantis-idles-canadian-mexican-factories-in-response-to-tariffs-SQxpCxe6c8MBWHu02Y3z) at its auto assembly factories in Mexico and Canada.

The turmoil spread beyond stocks, with [oil prices dropping](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/oil-prices-are-crashing-rVu8yDmkuGEWemhrqLYP) more than 6% and investors selling gold after its sharp run over the past year to fresh records.

So far, traders said, selling has been orderly and, though the scale of U.S. tariffs came as a shock, few investors are surprised to see stocks pull back following their gains over the past two years.

Still, the decline sets up financial markets for one of their most precarious periods in recent years, as the tariffs and international reaction test that faith of investors used to sticking with stocks.

**The details on tariffs:**

**All U.S. imports will be subject to a** [**10% tariff**](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/what-to-know-about-trumps-latest-tariff-policy-moves-8d9f8b37), effective April 5.

**Trump will impose even higher rates** on some nations that the White House considers bad actors on trade. For example, Japan faces a 24% duty and the European Union faces a 20% levy, effective April 9.

**China will be hit with** **a** [**new 34% tariff**](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/china-calls-trump-s-tariffs-unilateral-bullying-and-vows-countermeasures-c6ZKGMTXruL01dID4Moe), adding to previous duties, like the 20% tariff Trump imposed over fentanyl. That means the base tariff rate on Chinese imports will be 54%, before adding pre-existing levies.

**The tariffs are pegged** to amounts Trump says other countries impose on the U.S. [Here‚Äôs the math](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/math-behind-new-tariffs-points-to-trade-imbalance-as-key-issue-W4I7vbzaO5qFZS43hAjc) behind the levies

[**Hundreds of products will be exempted**](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/white-house-publishes-hundreds-of-tariff-exemptions-N7o4V7gxmuRUWOROnhqX) from the tariffs, according to a list published by the Trump administration Thursday, including energy products, a variety of minerals, and chemicals used in energy and manufacturing, vaccines and some metals..

**Canada and Mexico** **are excluded** **from the reciprocal tariff regime.** They are still subject to plans to impose 25% tariffs on most imports to the U.S., though the administration has given an exemption for autos and many other goods. Here‚Äôs a list of the [products and countries exempt](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/what-products-and-which-countries-are-exempted-from-trump-s-tariffs--qN2fmWrIFejrHBSVD8g5) from the tariffs.

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 üî¥ (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

üî¥ Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

üî¥ DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

üî∏ Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. üü¢

üî∏ Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. üü¢

üî∏ Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‚ÄòLiberation Day‚Äô events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. üü¢

üî∏ Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. üî¥

üî∏ Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn‚Äôt respond well and selling pressure intensified. üî¥

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China‚Äôs response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can‚Äôt afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn‚Äôt make any trades this week. What‚Äôs your prediction for next week?

2025-04-09 03:40:00,Here‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think China will cave,"It's kind of the body of evidence the last ~10 years or so.

First we have the Huawei and BYD situation. We (the US) basically locked some of their biggest companies out of the US market and guess what happened. Huawei took a hit but they came roaring back. They went ahead and dominated all the other markets. 

Then we have TikTok. The US has been pressuring China to sell TikTok for almost half a decade now. Not once have they moved an inch on this. We keep saying the sale is close and keep push it back 75 days. Even if a deal eventually gets done, I bet China's (Bytedance) is still going to own a major stake in it.

Then we had the Nvidia chips ban which was a total flop. Don't sell them the best chips. Well they went ahead and made DeepSeek anyway. What we should have done instead is sell them the chips but add a tariff. We basically forced their hand and now they are making their own chips to rival Nvidia. We inadvertently strengthened their semi production capability by imposing this ban.

And let's not forget COVID. Long after the world opened up because of economic, societal pressure ... China held on to their own detriment. They endured excruciating economic pain in the process, they also had the property collapse. This tells me the country has an unusual amount of tolerance for economic carnage.

It kind of reminds me of the Office where Michael Scott is negotiating the sale of his company with David Wallace: ""I don't need to wait out Dunder Mifflin, I just need to wait out you.""

2025-04-09 16:49:00,Trump administration backs off Nvidia's 'H20' chip crackdown after Mar-a-Lago dinner,"When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a¬†$1 million-a-head dinner¬†at Mar-a-Lago last week, a chip known as the H20 may have been on his mind.

That's because chip industry insiders widely expected the Trump administration to¬†impose curbs on the H20, the most cutting-edge AI chip U.S. companies can legally sell to China, a crucial market to one of the world's most valuable companies.

Following the Mar-a-Lago dinner, the White House reversed course on H20 chips, putting the plan for additional restrictions on hold, according to two sources with knowledge of the plan who were not authorized to speak publicly.

The planned American export controls on the H20 had been in the works for months, according to the two sources, and were ready to be implemented as soon as this week.

The change of course from the White House came after Nvidia promised the Trump administration new U.S. investments in AI data centers, according to one of the sources.

American lawmakers have been pressuring the Trump administration for weeks to place stricter curbs on cutting edge technology related to artificial intelligence. In February, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo.,¬†jointly¬†called¬†for export controls on the H20 chip after Chinese tech company DeepSeek¬†unveiled¬†a breakthrough AI chatbot that stunned the world in January.

The Trump administration's decision to allow Chinese firms to continue to purchase H20 chips is a major victory for the country, said Chris Miller, a Tufts University history professor and semiconductor expert.

""Even though these chips are specifically modified to reduce their performance thus making them legal to sell to China ‚Äî they are better than many, perhaps most, of China's homegrown chips,"" Miller said. ""China still can't produce the volume of chips it needs domestically, so it is critically reliant on imports of Nvidia chips.""

The White House and the Commerce Department did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Nvidia declined to comment.

The Trump administration has reversed course on plans to restrict exports of Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after CEO Jensen Huang attended a Mar-a-Lago dinner last week, NPR reported on Wednesday.

The reversal comes despite months of work on new export controls and mounting national security concerns from both sides of the aisle. Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chip is currently the most advanced AI hardware legally allowed for export to China, and Chinese firms like ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent have reportedly placed around $16 billion in orders just in Q1.

Sources suggest the about-face was tied to Nvidia‚Äôs promise of new AI investments in U.S. data centers - effectively trading access to Chinese markets for domestic tech growth.

2025-04-10 07:12:00,Trump Tariffs Wiped $10 Trillion From Stock Markets. It's 50% Of EU Economy,"      Trump has denied that he backtracked on the tariffs      Washington:  The stock market rout triggered by US President Donald Trump's punishing tariff wars wiped over $10 trillion off major markets across the globe. The financial destruction, historic in scale, was equivalent to just over half of the GDP of the European Union, according to a report by Bloomberg.¬†After Trump announced sweeping tariffs last week, markets remained volatile for days, with stocks, bonds, and commodities fluctuating wildly due to fears of a recession and a global trade war.American Markets Most HitAfter President Trump announced the sweeping tariffs, Wall Street was hit hard. For the first time in nearly a century, the S&P 500 saw three consecutive declines of 4 per cent, its worst performance since the end of the Second World War and rivaled by the 1987 Black Monday stock market rout.Losses during this time surpassed damages unleashed by the 2020 Covid pandemic, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers or the losses of 1998, according to a report by El Pais.¬†Though markets were impacted globally, the US stock market bore the biggest brunt, with tech giants referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven""-Apple, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla-- being hit hardest.¬†Per the El Pais report, ""Magnificent Seven"" lost staggering $1.6 trillion since last Thursday, with Apple bearing the biggest brunt and losing over half a trillion dollars, or about 16.8 per cent of its worth during this time. This was mainly because the tariffs directly impacted the company, whose devices are entirely manufactured in Asia.¬†Nvidia reportedly came next, losing $385 billion, followed by Amazon, with $262 billion lost during the rout. Other than that, giants of the traditional US economy like JP Morgan, Eli Lilly, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, and Bank of America also hemorrhaged more than $54 billion in three days, El Pais report said.Impact Beyond USThough US stocks were hardest hit, the other nations also witnessed financial losses. Saudi Arabia's state oil behemoth, Aramco, lost ¬†$138 billion or 8 per cent of its market value in three days. European companies, though smaller in size than American ones, are not left untouched either. Companies like HSBC and Shell (UK), Siemens (Germany), LVMH (France), Total (France), SAP (Germany), Accenture (Ireland), and Novo Nordisk (Denmark) are reportedly on the list of the biggest losers.¬†Asian companies, including China's Alibaba, Japan's Toyota and Mitsubishi, Taiwan's TSMC, which lost &#8364;78 billion in value in just one session (last week was partly a holiday in the country), and South Korea's Samsung lost billions of dollars in three days.Trump Tariff Pause And Market ReboundDays after registering little to no concern for the market bloodbath, US President Trump on Wednesday abruptly paused tariffs on most countries, sparking euphoria on global markets. However, he upped the ante on a brutal trade war with superpower rival China and raised tariffs on Beijing to 125 percent because of a ""lack of respect.""After days of turmoil, stocks on Wall Street and across Asia saw huge surges in reaction to Trump's announcement that he was halting a levy hike for almost all nations for 90 days.Meanwhile, Beijing hit back with retaliatory levies of 84 percent on US imports, which came into effect just after midday on Thursday, the latest salvo in an escalating standoff between the world's two largest economies.Trump has denied that he backtracked on the tariffs, telling reporters that ""you have to be flexible.""He said he had been watching the ""very tricky"" state of the crucial US bonds market before his decision.""I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,"" he said, as US bond yields rose during the stocks sell-off -- a major economic red light as American sovereign government debt is normally seen as a safe haven for investors in troubled times.Trump also predicted that trade deals will be made with all countries, including China, which has for now refused to roll back retaliatory tariffs on US goods.

2025-04-10 10:00:00,"Meet The Tiny Startup Building Stargate, OpenAI‚Äôs $500 Billion Data Center Moonshot","Crusoe Energy got its start harnessing oilfield flare gas to mine bitcoin. So how did cofounders Chase Lochmiller and Cully Cavness end up building the first phase of the world‚Äôs biggest AI datacenter ‚Äì $500 billion Project Stargate ‚Äì for OpenAI and Oracle?  It‚Äôs a windy, 80-degree, early March day at the 1,000-acre construction site in Abilene, Texas codenamed Project Ludicrous, where 2,000 workers toil over what will soon be one of the world‚Äôs largest artificial intelligence datacenters. Here under its official name ‚Äî The Stargate Project ‚Äî OpenAI will team with Oracle and Microsoft to create what they claim could be the first generation of AI models to fully surpass human cognition. It will be a ‚Äúfactory of factories,‚Äù says Chase Lochmiller, CEO of lead developer Crusoe Energy. What he means is that AIs trained here will be used to develop more such systems down the line, producing an endless stream of intelligence-as-a-service.  By the end of this year Crusoe expects 100,000 Nvidia graphic processing units (GPUs) to be installed into each of the first two 500,000 square foot ‚ÄúH‚Äù-shaped buildings. Lochmiller, just has to find the right path, both for 8-year-old, $300 million revenue Crusoe, as well as for the Polaris jeep navigating around cranes and trucks on the dusty site. ‚ÄúIt's hard to keep up with the topography of this site. I was here three weeks ago, it didn't look anything like this,‚Äù he says. Crusoe cofounder and COO Cully CavnessCody Pickens for Forbes Each Stargate datacenter building will draw 100 megawatts of electricity, enough for a city of 100,000. Most of that power will come from the hundreds of 300-foot-tall wind turbines spinning in west Texas, which on most days generate far more electricity than the region needs. Windmill owners with a surplus sometimes even sell power into the grid at a loss, making it up by collecting federal green energy tax credits. ‚ÄúNot a great use of those electrons,‚Äù says Lochmiller, 38, who is working to arbitrage that cheap juice for Stargate, which could eventually consume several gigawatts in Abilene. And in case the wind should stop blowing or the Texas grid goes down, Crusoe has set up five gas turbines from General Electric Vernova for backup.  Crusoe raised $3.4 billion in joint venture funding with asset management company Blue Owl Capital and data center-focused investment firm Primary Digital Infrastructure for these first two buildings. But that‚Äôs only a sliver of the $500 billion Oracle founder Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promised in January to invest over the next five years to build the future of AI and secure America‚Äôs global advantage. Sharing a drone shot of the site on X, Altman enthused over the ‚Äúbig, beautiful, buildings.‚Äù That‚Äôs the kind of thing that appeals to President Trump, who in his February speech to Congress lauded the investment, ‚ÄúWhich they wouldn‚Äôt have done if Kamala had won,‚Äù he said.   But why pick relatively unknown Crusoe to build it? Oracle, Microsoft and OpenAI wouldn‚Äôt comment, but it‚Äôs clear, at least to Crusoe‚Äôs investors and partners, that Lochmiller and cofounder Cully Cavness had the drive to build datacenters bigger and faster than they ever had before, and faith that they would find enough energy to power them. A successful outcome is far from assured, and some Crusoe clients are frustrated about what they say is the company‚Äôs less-than-reliable existing cloud computing offerings. Even if this first phase of Stargate, which will eventually comprise 10 buildings, representing 1.2 gigawatts of computing power at a cost of an estimated $15 billion goes off without a hitch, how could Crusoe possibly keep up the momentum and supply chains for AI‚Äôs insatiable appetite for compute and power?Forbes Forbes 2025 AI 50 List The Forbes Artificial Intelligence 50 List of 2025 spotlights promising AI-driven businesses. See the leaders driving the future of the industry.  VIEW THE FULL LIST Another hitch: President Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariffs imposed on some 90 countries last week (now paused), which could make key materials like aluminum and structural steel more expensive and ratchet costs for datacenter developers like Crusoe. The company says it sees it as a competitive moat. ‚ÄúFrom the beginning, Crusoe made the decision to onshore the manufacturing of critical electrical components including switchgear because we believe in building things in America,‚Äù Lochmiller says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a shiny factor with Crusoe,‚Äù says consultant Daniel Golding, who calls them ‚Äúthe flavor of the month.‚Äù After all, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have separately earmarked more than $200 billion for AI infrastructure. Not all will get built, says analyst Zach Krause at East Daley Analytics in Denver. For instance, Microsoft in March announced a slight pullback in datacenter leasing. Krause figures those that do get completed will add some 80 gigawatts of electricity demand nationwide by 2030, an unprecedented 10% growth, or as much as all of Texas uses on a hot summer day. Anyone who remembers Internet 1.0 will recall the vast overbuilding in fiber optic cables and datacenters that evaporated billions when boom turned to bust.  Lochmiller and Cavness, 37, went to high school together in Denver, spending weekends rock climbing. Lochmiller, 6-foot-1 with a shock of black hair, got into AI when he went to Stanford for grad school in 2013. He was struck by Professor Andrew Ng‚Äôs contention that ‚ÄúAI is the new electricity‚Äù soon to be just as widely distributed and relied upon by civilization. AI also consumes massive amounts of power, a truth Lochmiller experienced first hand when running up bills to power the stock forecasting and trading algorithms he built at hedge fund KCG Holdings in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, Cavness had become obsessed with locating the world‚Äôs cheapest, greenest energy sources, visiting 25 countries like Chile and Argentina, even looking at geothermal in Iceland. On a hiking adventure in 2017, the duo decided to join forces to tap ‚Äústranded‚Äù energy sources that would otherwise be wasted to power computing. They named their company after Robinson Crusoe, a fictional 18th century character who was marooned on a Caribbean island and used his resourcefulness to survive. Their first target: redirecting so-called flare gas from oil field operations. Sometimes when new oil wells get drilled, the owners opt to burn off relatively small amounts of natural gas rather than go to the expense of hooking up a pipeline. This wastes energy and produces harmful carbon dioxide. Crusoe‚Äôs big idea was to redirect the natural gas from flares and instead use it to power reciprocating engines to make electricity ‚Äî to mine bitcoin. Early backers were skeptical; Stefan Cohen at Bain Capital led Crusoe‚Äôs $4.5 million seed round in 2019, but initially even he wasn‚Äôt 100% sold: ‚ÄúThe business model itself was not overwhelmingly obvious to us.‚Äù Determined to prove it could be done, Lochmiller put in $600,000 of his own money to build out a shipping container crypto mining rig and set it up in a gas field near Denver. Over time, Crusoe began building compute infrastructure in harsher terrains. Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity Partners, an early backer of Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla, SpaceX and most recently OpenAI rival xAI, first met the team in 2018 when they were installing their first containers in North Dakota‚Äôs Bakken oil field. In the middle of a snowstorm, Gracias flew in to see what they were doing. The weather didn‚Äôt phase Lochmiller, an accomplished mountaineer who had climbed Everest two weeks earlier. Gracias, who almost set himself on fire on one of the heaters, says, ‚ÄúIt was crazy at the time, which is what I loved about it.‚Äù Another early investor, Lee Jacobs of Long Journey, could tell Crusoe had foresight because their original pitch deck, from when the company was focused on bitcoin mining, declared they would forge ‚Äúthe future of compute.‚Äù Jacobs doubled down last December, joining Crusoe‚Äôs $600 million fundraise. ‚ÄúThey always saw what was happening ‚Äî intelligence as a service delivered down a pipe like electricity.‚Äù The company almost came to a standstill in 2020, when lockdowns spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic temporarily dried up demand for gasoline. Oil companies shut down drilling and with it the supply of to-be flared gas that was core to Crusoe‚Äôs business. The company scrambled to find new locations and found a solution in focusing on greener sources of energy. That set up Crusoe for its leap to AI. In 2023, Crusoe borrowed $200 million to purchase coveted Nvidia H100 GPUs to expand its nascent cloud computing services and hired talent from the likes of datacenter giants 365 Main and Digital Realty. They topped off the year by partnering with Iceland‚Äôs AtNorth data center developer to set up their Crusoe Cloud services in the frigid country (making it easier to cool off GPUs). ""Crusoe is building datacenters larger than Digital Realty ever did,"" marvels former CEO Bill Stein, now a Crusoe board member. Key to their longterm success, he says, will be ""signing 15 year leases where counterparty risk is minimal,"" like with Stargate. Crusoe‚Äôs shot at the big time came in the first quarter of 2024. Lochmiller had learned that some tech giants, believed to be OpenAI and Microsoft (he declines to say who) were shopping for contractors to build an AI-specialized, hyperscale datacenter, and do it fast. Other developers balked at the ludicrous timetable of less than two years. Land acquisition, permits, supply chain lead times, all looked impossible. But Lochmiller and Cavness jumped on the RFP. It was less of a pivot, more of an evolution. They already had manufacturing centers in Denver and Tulsa, relationships with important suppliers like G.E. Vernova and new advisors. They were confident Crusoe could build it. As for where, they quickly subleased 1,000 acres in Abilene from developer Lancium, which had already permitted the site and intended to build a crypto mining center. By June 2024, OpenAI and Oracle had announced a partnership where the artificial intelligence giant would use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to integrate AI into Microsoft‚Äôs Azure platform. Jared Sheiker, managing director at datacenter investor Blue Owl Capital ($250 billion assets) was impressed with the ‚Äúaudacity‚Äù of Crusoe. ‚ÄúLocking up a long-term lease with Oracle made this project overnight abundantly attractive to us,‚Äù he says. Blue Owl contributed to Crusoe‚Äôs $600 million 2024 fundraise and helped arrange $2.3 billion in project financing from JPMorgan for the first two buildings and 200 megawatts of compute. All told Crusoe has now raised $1.82 billion in equity and was last valued at $2.8 billion. The datacenter buildings will include four data halls of 25 megawatts of compute each. Factories in Denver and Tulsa will manufacture server racks and install GPUs into skid-mounted units that are trucked to Abilene for installation. It‚Äôs far better to do this in a controlled environment than a dusty, noisy construction site, says Lochmiller; ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want tradesmen stacked on top of each other.‚Äù The GPUs will use liquid cooling. Two-foot diameter water pipes course around the inside of the building; they will continuously recirculate 1 million gallons of chilled water through a network of pipes reaching into the racks of GPUs like capillaries to draw off heat. It‚Äôs a lot of water, but they only have to fill up the system for each building once. By comparison, 1 million gallons is less than what shale gas frackers use to complete a single well. Crusoe and Co. are far from the only ones building facilities like this right now. Others are building bigger and faster. Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI managed to build a massive ‚Äúgigafactory of compute‚Äù in Memphis in just 122 days. Dubbed Colossus, it now has a network of 200,000 GPUs to support its AI supercomputer. Lochmiller says Musk‚Äôs facility is starkly different from what Crusoe is doing: building from the ground up or what‚Äôs known as greenfield development. ‚ÄúThe xAI datacenter, they took an existing building and then retrofitted it to sort of meet the internal electrical needs of the compute racks,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was very creative, but just a very different project than what we've done here.‚Äù Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he‚Äôll invest $65 billion into AI, mostly for datacenters, this year. His biggest is the Sucr√© project in northern Louisiana, a 4 million square feet datacenter with 2 gigawatts of compute expected to cost about $10 billion. Over the longer term, datacenter developers are looking to advances in nuclear power to displace fossil fuels. Amazon has promised $100 billion of AI spending and last year invested $500 million into nuclear startup X-Energy, which aims to build 5 gigawatts of small, modular reactors on datacenter grounds. OpenAI and Softbank are big backers of nuclear fusion developer Helion, which has already presold electricity to Microsoft. The big question: does training AI truly require so much datacenter capacity? The viral launch of Chinese AI darkhorse DeepSeek, which claimed it built cutting edge AI models that rivaled OpenAI‚Äôs top systems at a fraction of the cost and far less compute, has surfaced concerns about the billions of dollars being plunged into AI infrastructure, at a time when companies are yet to reap real ROI. Lochmiller insists more cost-efficient AI training will unlock new use cases. ‚ÄúWhat couldn‚Äôt be improved by adding intelligence?‚Äù he says. He also envisions people will soon pay for intelligence the same way they now do for water or electricity. But is Crusoe ready? Some customers worry Crusoe‚Äôs cloud system is unreliable. In early March one of its centers experienced an outage that lasted 45 hours. One customer, which uses Crusoe Cloud to access GPUs and asked not to be named, was affected by the outage, forcing them to fall back to other cloud providers. ‚ÄúThis was a big deal. We were pretty unhappy about it,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThey're not as reliable.‚Äù An industry expert raised an eyebrow as well.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs less differentiation in Crusoe than they would want you to believe,‚Äù they explained. ‚ÄúBut there's enough demand where anybody that can provide power on site, which is a differentiator.‚Äù Crusoe says its service maintains an uptime of up to 99.98%. And other customers appear to be perfectly happy. ‚ÄúCrusoe is faster than a lot of companies right now,‚Äù says Varun Mohan, CEO of AI coding company Windsurf (formerly Codeium.) Crusoe is able to get its customers access to hardware in a matter of three to four hours, and speed is the need of the hour amid a fierce race to launch more capable AI models. Hyperscalers like AWS and Google Cloud, on the other hand, would take three weeks and bind them in years-long reservations. Nor is Lochmiller immediately concerned about the threat to datacenter demand from new more efficient AI models like China‚Äôs DeepSeek. An AI that uses less ‚Äúcompute‚Äù and therefore less energy to achieve similar results could imply weaker future demand for datacenters. That risks datacenter overbuild, and bust ‚Äî like the bankruptcy-inducing overcapacity in servers and fiberoptic cables at the end of the first Internet boom 25 years ago. Not to worry. After all, Crusoe financed Project Ludicrous on the back of a 15-year contract with Oracle and Microsoft. Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, argued on X this year that AI datacenter growth is immune to normal capital cycles due to something called the Jevons paradox. It‚Äôs named after William Stanley Jevons, the British economist (d. 1882) who determined that lowering the cost of a fuel (coal in his case) will only cause demand for it to rise. ‚ÄúJevons paradox strikes again,‚Äù Nadella wrote in January. ‚ÄúAs AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can‚Äôt get enough of.‚Äù Looking toward Interstate-20 on the southern part of the site and the town of Abilene beyond, Lochmiller marvels at the procession of earth movers hauling tons of north Texas red dirt. They‚Äôre working to flatten what used to be known as Rattlesnake Ridge, where the next set of datacenters will be built. It takes an ironically vast amount of manual labor to accomplish the end goal of the AI revolution, which Lochmiller describes as ‚Äúfreeing up all of that mind space, that creative brain power to focus on higher level abstractions.‚Äù He expects to more than double the number of workers on site to 5,000 at peak next year.

President Donald Trump raised tariffs on China to 125% after China retaliated against Trump's ... More ""Liberation Day"" tariffs.  (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images  Key Facts   Mao Ning, spokesperson for China‚Äôs ministry of foreign affairs, posted a meme on X Thursday morning depicting the cost of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hats spiking by more than 50%, presumably because of Trump‚Äôs tariffs.    The meme depicts the hat with a ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù tag, but official MAGA hats are actually made in the United States, though some unofficial knock-off merchandise may be made in China.    Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the United States, doubled down on Mao‚Äôs meme, posting a meme of MAGA hats spiking in price by more than 100%, which he says was first posted by a user on the Chinese social media app Rednote.    Some AI-generated memes that have circulated on Chinese social media depict Americans working in factories‚Äîin some videos, making Tesla products‚Äîas an apparent nod to Trump‚Äôs desire to reinvigorate American manufacturing through his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs plan.   These memes have gone widely viral on X, with one video of Americans, depicted as overweight, working in a textile factory, which has been viewed nearly 20 million times on X with more than 227,000 likes.   Liu and many other social media users had also posted memes targeting Trump‚Äôs widely mocked tariffs against Heard Island and McDonald Islands, uninhabited territories that were slapped with a 10% tariff, depicting penguins protesting Trump‚Äôs duties on the remote islands.     What‚Äôs Happening With Trump‚Äôs Tariffs In China? China has become Trump‚Äôs biggest tariff target and is exempt from his 90-day pause on tariffs to many nations Trump announced on Wednesday. Trump, instead, raised tariffs on China to 125%, which he says is because of the country‚Äôs retaliatory tariffs imposed on the United States. Trump slammed China‚Äôs ‚Äúlack of respect‚Äù for global markets in a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing increased duties, while criticizing the nation for ‚Äúripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries.‚Äù China had previously retaliated with 84% tariffs on the United States. China‚Äôs commerce ministry spokesperson He Yongqian said Thursday the ‚Äúdoor to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on an equal basis with mutual respect.‚Äù China issued a travel warning to the United States on Wednesday, citing the ‚Äúdeterioration of China-US economic and trade relations.‚Äù Key Background Trump‚Äôs chaotic tariff rollout has roiled global markets and quickly caused some of the stock market‚Äôs worst days in years. Trump touted his tariffs as ‚Äúliberation‚Äù for the United States and announced tariff hikes on nearly every country last week, accusing them of ripping off the United States in global trade. The tariffs sparked international criticism, as well as some bipartisan pushback in the United States, and caused stocks to instantly tank, with economists voicing fears the U.S. would head toward a recession. Various billionaires, including close Trump ally and Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk, have spoken out against the tariffs. Trump announced a 90-day pause on many tariffs Wednesday, bringing down tariffs to a universal 10% rate, prompting stocks to surge. Stocks dipped again Thursday morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 744 points, or 1.8%, with tech companies Apple, Nvidia and Tesla falling 3%, 4.9% and 5%, respectively.

2025-04-10 17:18:00,Nvidia Stock Could Fall If 125% China Tariff Drives Price Increases,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las ... More Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images Updated, April 10, 2025: This post has been adjusted to reflect the change in U.S. tariffs on China to 145%.  Nvidia stock has fallen 30% from its January 2025 peak of $153, evaporating $1.03 trillion from the company‚Äôs market capitalization, according to Google Finance.   One thing contributing to the drop is the results of the 2024 presidential election which brought Donald Trump back to the Oval Office. Since April 2, his tariff policy has thrown markets into turmoil.  And despite Trump‚Äôs trumpeting of a 90-day pause on most tariffs, Nvidia could be in worse shape. That‚Äôs because tariffs are high on countries where Nvidia products are built. More specifically, Taiwan faced a 34% tariff ‚Äì reduced Wednesday to 10% ‚Äì while China‚Äôs rose to 145% on April 10, according to the Wall Street Journal.   Is the drop in Nvidia‚Äôs stock a buying opportunity? I see no reason to buy now because although orders may have soared in the current quarter in anticipation of tariffs, I expect the company‚Äôs May 2025 earnings report to feature a disappointing growth forecast as a result of tariff uncertainty. More specifically, the uncertainty is due to the difficulty of answering precisely the following questions:  How much will tariffs on Taiwan and China increase Nvidia's costs? Will Nvidia pass those cost increases on to customers? If so, will Nvidia be able to meet its growth targets for the current quarter and the year? If Nvidia decides to hold prices constant, how much will the company's margins decline? In light of economic uncertainty caused by the ongoing tariff tit-for-tat, are companies cutting back on capital expenditures? If so, how much is that reducing demand for Nvidia GPUs?  Nvidia remains bullish. In March, CEO Jensen Huang said tariffs would not cause meaningful short-term harm to the company due to the company‚Äôs agile supply chain; demand for AI would drive demand, and TSMC was building a plant in Arizona, according to Barron‚Äôs.

A spokesperson referred me to a March 2025 company statement from Huang, which said. ‚ÄúTariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we‚Äôre going to have manufacturing onshore.‚Äù Read on for why Nvidia‚Äôs costs could rise significantly, whether Nvidia will pass along those costs to customers, and how the uncertainty around future moves in the global tariff wars may crimp consumer spending and company‚Äôs investments in generative artificial intelligence.  What To Expect From Nvidia‚Äôs Next Earnings Report Nvidia will report quarterly financial results next month featuring slower top-line growth and thinner margins based on the company‚Äôs forecasts when it last reported in February.    First quarter fiscal 2026 revenue: $43 billion ‚Äì plus or minus 2%, according to a company release ‚Äì which is up 65% from the year before and $700 million more than estimates, according to SeekingAlpha. First quarter fiscal 2026 gross margin: 70.6% plus or minus 0.5 percentage points ‚Äì an 8.4 percentage point drop from the year before, according to a company release.  Nvidia expressed enthusiasm about its prospects. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,"" said Huang in a statement. ""AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.‚Äù Analysts were underwhelmed by Nvidia‚Äôs results ‚Äì which lacked ‚Äúthe positive shock value of some of last year‚Äôs reports,‚Äù Sungarden YARP Portfolio Investing Group Leader Rob Isbitts told SeekingAlpha. Nvidia‚Äôs stock is likely to trade ‚Äúmore on raw demand and supply, rather than on some sort of surprise element,‚Äù Isbitts added. ‚ÄúGuidance was slightly underwhelming,‚Äù Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said in a report featured by Bloomberg. ""We think it will be challenging for management to continue to significantly beat expectations for future growth,‚Äù Purk added. How Tariffs Could Affect Nvidia‚Äôs Growth Prospects Tariffs could increase significantly the prices of some Nvidia products. However, it is unclear whether Nvidia will pass all of its increased costs on to customers and whether the higher prices would lower demand. A more significant question for Nvidia‚Äôs future is whether companies will view the high investment in generative AI as being worth the $1 trillion Goldman Sachs estimated. If the technology enables companies to do better work with fewer people, demand for generative AI may remain strong in the event of a recession. How Tariffs Could Raise Nvidia‚Äôs Prices Not all of Nvidia‚Äôs products are vulnerable to being harmed by Trump‚Äôs tariffs. For example, fears of a Trump administration crackdown on Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chip ‚Äì which the company has been exporting to China ‚Äì may not be realized. The reason? ‚ÄúNvidia promised the Trump administration new U.S. investments in AI data centers,‚Äù according to a report from NPR. However, tariffs could raise consumer personal computer prices by as much as 50%, according to WCCFTech. These estimates were made April 3 when the tariff on Chinese goods was a mere 54% ‚Äì a far cry from the 145% tariff imposed on April 10. Tariffs could raise manufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price prices on the following Nvidia gaming machines by at least 50% ‚Äì based on the latest triple-digit tariff:  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 from $1,999 to $2,998.50, according to WCCFTech. Applying the 145% tariff would send the price to $4,897.75. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 from $999 to $1,498.50, WCCFTech noted. The 145% tariff would send the price to $2,447.75.  It remains unclear whether Nvidia will be able to avoid tariffs on GPUs for now. The tariffs could be avoided if actual products are assembled in the U.S., noted Tom‚Äôs Hardware. For now, Nvidia may be able to ship ‚Äúactual GPUs and processors/chipsets to the U.S. without paying import duties along with half-finished logic boards ‚Äì but paying an import tariff -- then assemble actual products in the U.S.,‚Äù reported Tom‚Äôs Hardware. Tariffs Could Lower Demand For AI Generative AI has been in search of a killer app, as I wrote in the Boston Globe. There has been no obvious progress on this goal and the investment required for the technology is enormous ‚Äì potentially totaling $1 trillion. Prior to the tariff announcement, the largest hyperscalers ‚Äì Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft ‚Äì announced plans to spend $270 billion on generative AI data centers in 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal.  However, that spending could take a hit ‚Äì especially for companies like Meta and Google which are dependent on advertising for much of their revenue. If tariffs and the resulting uncertainty cause a recession ‚Äì due to rising prices and fear of declining demand and higher unemployment ‚Äì companies could decide to cut back on their generative AI spending. The reason for cutting back would be a simple realization that the return on investment in generative AI is not yet compelling. Amazon‚Äôs cloud-computing arm historically has generated $4 of incremental revenue for every $1 of capital spending, TD Cowen John Blackledge tech analyst told the Journal. Generative AI‚Äôs ratio ‚Äúis currently something like 20 cents for every dollar,‚Äù Blackledge added. Microsoft, which plans to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in the current fiscal year, is slowing construction ‚Äì including a $1 billion project in Ohio. Microsoft canceled leases in the U.S. and Europe -- partly due to an oversupply of data-center space relative to the company‚Äôs demand forecast, noted TD Cowen analysts. However, ‚Äúthe moves signal a more cautious stance in the longer term,‚Äù the Journal reported. All that could be painful for Nvidia investors ‚Äì unless surviving with fewer people during a long period of stagflation becomes the killer app for generative AI.

2025-04-10 21:19:00,Retail investors are running head first into this topsy-turvy market," / Source: CNBCBy Alex Harring, CNBCWhile Wall Street spent the past week sweating over whether President Donald Trump‚Äôs¬†now-altered tariff plan¬†would push the economy into a recession or ignite a bear market, Rachel Hazit knew exactly what to do.The Philadelphia-based marketer used cash she had on the sidelines to buy equities like the¬†Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)¬†and the¬†Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQM)¬†last week. After learning about investing last year, the 32-year-old felt like she was seeing her first big drop in the market as someone with skin in the game.‚ÄúI see this time now as an opportunity,‚Äù Hazit said in an interview with CNBC this week. When the market declined last week, she remembers thinking: ‚ÄúThis is on sale.‚ÄùHazit‚Äôs investments are part of a flood of money totaling billions of dollars from everyday investors who have entered the stock market in recent days. These retail traders appear to following the conventional market wisdom of ‚Äúbuying the dip,‚Äù which refers to a strategy of purchasing stocks when they decline because they‚Äôre considered discounted.Trump‚Äôs¬†April 2¬†announcement of broad and steep tariffs sent the stock market reeling as investors feared the taxes on imports would hamstring consumer spending and drive up inflation. Several Wall Street strategists¬†cut their outlooks¬†for the¬†S&P 500, a benchmark index of the largest public companies in the U.S., while multiple economists for these firms¬†hiked¬†the likelihood for a recession.That all came to a head exactly one week later: Trump on Wednesday¬†rolled back¬†most of his planned levies, citing investor fears as one driver of the decision. An afternoon rally following the news pushed the S&P 500 up more than 9% in the session, marking its best day since 2008.Institutional investors ran for the hills during that week, causing the S&P 500 to briefly dip into bear market territory, which refers to a 20% drop from recent highs. But data from market insights firm Vanda Research, a trusted authority on retail investor trends, showed mom-and-pop traders like Hazit doing the exact opposite.‚ÄúWhat marks an equity drawdown? It‚Äôs usually retail capitulation as the final shoe to drop,‚Äù said Marco Iachini, vice president of research at Vanda. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre clearly not seeing that.‚ÄùConsider that on April 3, while the S&P 500 cratered nearly 5% in the wake of Trump‚Äôs initial announcement, self-directed retail investors pushed more than $3 billion into U.S. stocks on balance. That‚Äôs the largest daily net haul on record, per Vanda data going back to 2014.Small investors continued to buy stocks on balance over the following three days as the market tanked. In total, retail traders sent around $8.8 billion in net inflows to the U.S. stock market between last Thursday and this Tuesday, per Vanda.Those purchases took place during an especially rocky stretch for the market. In the period between the April 2 close and the end of trading on April 8, the¬†Dow Jones Industrial Average¬†lost more than 4,500 points and the S&P 500 tumbled 12%.Similarly, JPMorgan found retail traders bought around $11 billion in equities over the past week ended Wednesday. That‚Äôs about 2.5 times higher than the average seen over the past year, the firm said.What retail investors wantSome trading during this period appeared tied to speculation on if Trump would roll back the levies he slapped on foreign countries, Vanda‚Äôs Iachini said. But Vanda has also seen strong inflows into exchange-traded funds tracking the broader market like Vanguard‚Äôs VOO and State Street‚Äôs¬†SPY.Purchasing these diversified indexes can signal individual investors are looking to buy into the market and hold onto their positions for a longer-term period, Iachini said. That‚Äôs a strategy retail trading experts favor over stock picking and day trading.This drive into broad market funds reflects the sentiment among the retail crowd that ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù is a successful strategy, Iachini said. The logic, he said, goes something like this: If it‚Äôs mostly worked and produced great returns over the last 15 years, why stop now?To be sure, these investors are raising their exposure to an increasingly risky market. The¬†CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street‚Äôs ‚Äúfear gauge‚Äù known in short as the VIX, closed at levels this week not seen since early 2020. The Dow, a blue-chip index closely followed by everyday traders, saw¬†its largest intraday point swing¬†in its history on Monday.Retail investors have stood firm despite the turbulence. Mark Malek, investing chief at Siebert Financial, said his firm‚Äôs team that handles retail traders saw strong demand to buy on Wednesday, even as Trump‚Äôs announcement of pared-back import taxes¬†catapulted¬†the market higher.Malek said there‚Äôs been significant interest in megacap technology names. In this vein, JPMorgan said¬†Nvidia¬†received about 6 of every 7 retail dollars sent into individual stocks on balance between April 2 and April 9.Investing-focused influencers have tried to spread the word about the buying opportunity and dissuade panic-selling during the recent market decline. Tori Dunlap, who runs a platform focused on teaching women and minorities how to build wealth through investing,¬†reminded followers¬†that ‚Äúmillionaires are made during market downturns.‚ÄùBut there‚Äôs also some key reasons for retail to sit out at this moment. One retail investor told CNBC that while he would have liked to buy the dip, he needed to save his cash on hand to pay the IRS by the April 15¬†federal tax filing deadline.'Along for the ride'While Hazit has been sending cash into the market when it slides, she¬†isn‚Äôt happy¬†with the overall economic outlook. For example, she‚Äôs concerned about how Trump‚Äôs tariff policy could affect her spending power when she wants to buy a new phone in the future.‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something that I‚Äôm out here celebrating. I‚Äôm quietly just buying one stock at a time when I can,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely not a good time. It‚Äôs scary.‚ÄùEven as¬†consumer confidence declines¬†and¬†recession fears swirl, this cohort of market participants knows that recent days have provided a good time to deploy cash into stocks.Namaan Mian moved up his timeline to make his annual investments, knowing the decline in recent days provided an entry point. He bought shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF on Tuesday, which aligns with his strategy of focusing on broad market indexes.The 33-year-old said he wasn‚Äôt thinking about the potential for an economic downturn or what would ultimately happen with Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Because Mian looks longer term and has been investing since his teen years, he‚Äôs learned to detach emotion and always plans to keep holdings for at least several years. With this mindset, he said it can even become ‚Äúfun‚Äù to watch the market gyrate.‚ÄúIf I was 65 years old, I‚Äôm giving you a different answer,‚Äù Mian, the operations chief at a consultant training firm, told CNBC. ‚ÄúBut because I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm kind of just along for the ride.‚Äù‚Äî CNBC‚Äôs Sarah Min contributed to this report.More from CNBC:How the mother of all ‚Äòshort squeezes‚Äô helped drive stocks to historic gains Wednesday Freight surges on tariff reversal: Trade whipsaws from ‚Äòsuper cautious‚Äô to ‚Äòships are filling up‚Äô See if you qualify for the $1,400 IRS stimulus check before the deadline Alex Harring, CNBC",News,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/retail-investors-are-running-head-first-topsy-turvy-market-rcna200754,3
2025-04-11 00:36:00,I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months. I finally sold.,"First off, I would like to preface this with saying my condolences to those who have incurred any losses lately. It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.

As many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent ""Yen Carry Trade"" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.

Last year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.

\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.

\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.

\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work. This article was one example:  
[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555)

\- Suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy: In 2024, we reached one of the highest rate in the decade [https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades)

\- Trump winning the presidential election: I was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign, and I knew that if he actually did implement these, it would shock the market. It was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not, which he did.

With all these reasonings in mind, I had a 90% confidence that the market would crash soon, so I YOLO'd my whole portfolio into UVIX after election.

https://preview.redd.it/ovma6m9vj3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd719e0b6d0ff7892d07461aa3eae2312d52caea

Holding this ticker was mentally tough, the market kept rallying from 580 to 620 post-election, and my position was decaying and I was holding a -200k loss for the vast majority of the time. Many people discouraged my position, and some think I should cut my losses. I even isolated myself for a while because I was so sure of my bet. There were two moments when I could have sold to break even: Federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and Trump's initial Canada/Mexico tariffs. But UVIX didn't rise as much as I anticipated, so I kept holding.

https://preview.redd.it/e5e6xfsxj3ue1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f45917088fa769ca5123420f1fec427851fbb2f

Fast forward to last week, Trump announced a severe blanket tariff, which crashed the market as we know it. This was finally the moment I've been waiting for as UVIX went from $20 to $100 in the span of 4 days. I kept my eyes on the news, set my alarm to 6 am to watch the market open. UVIX could rapidly drop/rise in matter of seconds, and I did not want to sell too early/late, so I was shedding 1k shares a day to be safe. 1k at 70, 1k at 90, 2k at 100 on Tuesday. At this point, I had 3k remaining, and I was hoping that UVIX would maybe rise to 140, but then Trump sent out the tweet that he's basically cancelling the tariffs, which shot the market back up, and plummeted UVIX to 40, luckily I was able to salvage and sell at 56 on the way down. It wasn't quite the finish I was hoping for, but overall, I did get to gain roughly 250k off of my 400k bet.

https://preview.redd.it/k4bzie1sk3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=f788c3fce00964a3a5e9f9202b6db85d3f5bda4a

Now that I've been able to cash out on the big -20% SPY crash I've anticipated, I am completely out of UVIX for now. Even if the market continues to fall, I have full confidence that we'll eventually recover back to our previous 620 ATH, so I'll be DCAing into SPXL/TQQQ from this point on until we reach that price.

https://preview.redd.it/8j48yvnul3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68d62402c4fdc3ec905d7c036fcd3cee5ff37f1

In the end, I would not encourage anyone else to do what I did. Even with my conviction and accurate market reading, I had to hold UVIX for 6 months, which ended up being one of the most stressful thing I could do. I've lost sleep, became disillusioned with the economy/government, and absorbed more bad news than I could handle. I've internally cheered for bearish news, despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people.

I was somewhat lucky that Trump did indeed enact his tariffs, otherwise I may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted.

In the end, I'm just relieved that I could finally exit my large UVIX positions, and I will never all-in again the way I did. I hoped you all enjoyed my perspective/story and I wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i_allind_and_held_400k_in_uvix_for_6_months_i/,3

More for the app for Chinese AI company DeepSeek alongside the logo for the ChatGPT app on January 29, 2025 in Bath, England.  (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)Getty Images Trefis  Question: Why would someone pay 30 times earnings for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) when Nvidia stock is available at 33 times earnings? It may not seem logical, especially when considering these three key factors:   Growth: Nvidia‚Äôs revenue has been expanding at a significantly higher pace‚Äîover 80% annually over the past three years‚Äîwhile Microsoft has reported growth of approximately 12%. Margins: Nvidia maintains profit margins above 60%, allowing more of its revenue growth to convert into profits. Microsoft‚Äôs operating margins remain solid at 45% but still trail Nvidia‚Äôs. Tariffs: Microsoft‚Äôs expansive cloud services and large enterprise customer base could offer some insulation from the adverse effects of tariffs. Nvidia, on the other hand, currently enjoys a semiconductor exemption from tariffs. Moreover, leading tech firms such as Amazon, Google, and Meta are expected to sustain their investments in AI infrastructure despite current macroeconomic conditions.  Is Nvidia A Safe Bet? Although Nvidia may appear to be a ‚Äúsafe haven,‚Äù its historical performance during market disruptions suggests caution. During the 2022 inflation shock, NVDA plunged over 65%. In 2020, amid pandemic-driven uncertainty, the stock declined more than 35%. Most notably, it lost 85% of its value during the 2008‚Äì2009 financial crisis. So, NVDA doesn‚Äôt exactly qualify as a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers detailed insights into how Nvidia has performed during and after past market crashes.   Still, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has already corrected meaningfully, dropping from nearly $150 earlier this year to under $110 currently. Investors seeking a potentially more resilient alternative may want to explore the Trefis High Quality portfolio, a strategy that has returned more than 91% since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics.  Nvidia‚Äôs AI Dominance For investors who believe in the long-term growth of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be a compelling choice at its current valuation. The company holds a crucial position as an ‚Äúarms supplier‚Äù in the AI revolution. Investing in Nvidia is effectively backing the infrastructure that powers AI development across major companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon.   As the AI boom is still in its early phases, companies continue to invest heavily in supporting infrastructure. For instance, Meta‚Äôs projected capital expenditures for tech infrastructure stand at around $65 billion‚Äîillustrating the magnitude of ongoing AI investments.

Earnings may fall short of projections, and growth could decelerate from the current 50% rate to a more modest 30%, especially if firms begin conserving cash.  There‚Äôs also a possibility that Nvidia‚Äôs clients will prioritize building more efficient AI models, reducing their need for an ever-expanding volume of chips. Moreover, unexpected developments can adversely affect the stock. Investors should be aware of the potential for a 40% drop in share price under adverse conditions. However, selling amid such a downturn could undermine long-term investment goals.   Long-Term Perspective Preserve & Grow Wealth with Risk-Focused Quality Portfolios Despite these headwinds, long-term investors with a 3‚Äì5 year horizon who are comfortable with market volatility may find Nvidia attractive at current levels. For those interested in strategies designed to navigate downturns, the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio has consistently outperformed a blended benchmark of all-cap stocks, including the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Alternatively, investors could consider consulting with an advisor experienced in bear market strategies. Staying calm and strategic during turbulent markets can lead to significant long-term gains.

2025-04-11 12:01:00,Forbes Daily: China Hikes Tariffs On U.S. As Trade War Heats Up,"Relief on interest rates could still be coming, even as President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are expected to make inflation worse. But one key Federal Reserve official says there‚Äôs no ‚Äúgeneric playbook‚Äù for the current situation.  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee told reporters that Trump‚Äôs 10% global tariff will cause inflation to ‚Äúmaterially increase,‚Äù but said he still believes the Fed will lower rates in the next 12 to 18 months. The target federal funds rate remains at 4.25% to 4.5%, higher than it‚Äôs been in recent history as the central bank aims to combat inflation.   But markets are still flailing, as stocks pared down Wednesday‚Äôs gain on Thursday. And the White House confirmed tariffs on China are actually even higher than previously announced, with a rate of 145% for many goods.  FIRST UPAnadolu via Getty Images China raised its tariffs on all U.S. imports to 125% on Friday in retaliation against the Trump administration‚Äôs latest escalation of its trade war with the country, though Chinese officials indicated they do not plan to respond to any further increases in the tariff rate by the U.S. Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly commented on the worsening trade conflict for the first time, urging the European Union to side with it in pushing back against Washington.  A sightseeing helicopter crashed in the Hudson River in New York City on Thursday, killing all six people onboard‚Äîthe latest in a series of aviation disasters and near misses in the past few months. Earlier in the day, two American Airlines planes clipped wings while on the runway at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and though no one was injured, it was the latest alarming incident at the airport.  This is a published version of the Forbes Daily newsletter, you can sign-up to get Forbes Daily in your inbox here. BUSINESS + FINANCE  There was good news on the inflation front last month, as consumer prices increased less than expected year-over-year in March, though the 2.4% rate remained above the Fed‚Äôs target. Still, the numbers don‚Äôt reflect any impacts on prices from increased tariff rates, and even with the 90-day pause on many levies, the effective tariff rate will still increase by 15 percentage points, Goldman Sachs economists estimated Wednesday. TECH + INNOVATIONAFP via Getty Images Amid the recent political controversy surrounding Tesla, the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs sales of its Cybertruck fell sharply in the first quarter of the year. According to Cox Automotive, the company delivered just 6,406 Cybertrucks this year through March, less than half of what it delivered in the third and fourth quarters of last year. MONEY + POLITICS U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA)  and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD)Getty Images The House passed a budget plan Thursday after the vote was delayed earlier in the week as some Republicans wanted steeper cuts in spending. It‚Äôs the first step in executing President Donald Trump‚Äôs signature policy priorities, but Democrats have warned that Congress would have to slash entitlement spending to pay for the proposed tax cuts. Members of Congress traded as much as $1.27 million worth of Tesla stock after Elon Musk endorsed Trump, the latest in a slew of conflict-of-interest concerns as Musk plays a key role in the administration. At least nine House members and one senator bought or sold Tesla shares after July 13, the day the world‚Äôs richest man endorsed Trump, and they represent both parties. TRENDS + EXPLAINERS As more Americans turn to side hustles in the face of rising costs, social media is flooded with videos that promise ‚Äúeasy‚Äù paths to wealth. But many of the creators behind such videos are earning income from teaching others, reselling popular courses that promise to teach the foundations of building an online business. President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs led to market panic, but are they legal? Conservative lawyers argue Trump is exceeding his authority by enacting tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives presidents power to take major economic steps and impose sanctions during national emergencies. But it does not say anything explicitly about tariffs. DAILY COVER STORY Meet The Tiny Startup Building Stargate, OpenAI‚Äôs $500 Billion Data Center MoonshotCrusoe cofounder and CEO Chase LochmillerCody Pickens for Forbes  Through the Stargate Project, soon to be one of the world‚Äôs largest artificial intelligence datacenters, OpenAI will team with Oracle and Microsoft to create what they claim could be the first generation of AI models to fully surpass human cognition. Each Stargate datacenter building will draw 100 megawatts of electricity, enough for a city of 100,000. Most of that power will come from the hundreds of 300-foot-tall wind turbines spinning in west Texas, which on most days generate far more electricity than the region needs. Lead developer Crusoe Energy raised $3.4 billion in joint venture funding with asset management company Blue Owl Capital and data center-focused investment firm Primary Digital Infrastructure for these first two buildings. But that‚Äôs only a sliver of the $500 billion Oracle founder Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promised in January to invest over the next five years to build the future of AI and secure America‚Äôs global advantage. But why pick relatively unknown Crusoe to build it? Oracle, Microsoft and OpenAI wouldn‚Äôt comment, but it‚Äôs clear, at least to the startup‚Äôs investors and partners, that Crusoe CEO Chase Lochmiller and cofounder Cully Cavness had the drive to build datacenters bigger and faster than they ever had before, and faith that they would find enough energy to power them. A successful outcome is far from assured, and some Crusoe clients are frustrated about what they say is the company‚Äôs less-than-reliable existing cloud computing offerings. Even if this first phase of Stargate‚Äîwhich will eventually comprise 10 buildings, representing 1.2 gigawatts of computing power at a cost of an estimated $15 billion‚Äîgoes off without a hitch, how could Crusoe possibly keep up the momentum and supply chains for AI‚Äôs insatiable appetite for compute and power? WHY IT MATTERS ‚ÄúAI companies that were once constrained by the supply of advanced Nvidia chips face a new roadblock: power,‚Äù say Forbes reporter Rashi Shrivastava and senior editor Chris Helman. ‚ÄúSystems like ChatGPT consume tons of electricity, enough for tens of thousands of homes. That has translated into more opportunity for Crusoe, the $2.8 billion-valued company with a knack for finding untapped energy sources in remote places like North Dakota and Iceland and building datacenters to power compute-heavy tasks, starting with cryptocurrency mining and now running and training AI models.‚Äù MORE Forbes 2025 AI 50 List FACTS + COMMENTS Elon Musk backed down from his latest claim that DOGE would find $1 trillion in savings before his tenure at the agency was up.

2025-04-11 17:43:00,SMTC DEADLINE ALERT: Semtech Corporation (SMTC) Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact Hagens Berman¬†Before Apr. 22nd Deadline in Securities Class Action," SAN FRANCISCO, April  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ: SMTC) is navigating a turbulent period, facing a securities class-action lawsuit alleging investor deception regarding its CopperEdge product line. Recent comments from the company‚Äôs CEO during the Q4 2025 earnings call have brought the company's close relationships with key customers into sharper focus, raising questions about prior awareness of product-related challenges. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased Semtech securities and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Aug. 27, 2024 ‚Äì Feb. 7, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Apr. 22, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/smtc Contact the Firm Now: SMTC@hbsslaw.com ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†844-916-0895 Semtech‚Äôs Customer Relationships at Center of CopperEdge Delayed Ramp: The lawsuit, Kleovoulos v. Semtech Corporation, et al., centers on claims that Semtech misled investors about the readiness and projected ramp-up of CopperEdge, a critical component for advanced data center interconnects. During the March 13, 2025, earnings call, CEO Hong Hou acknowledged delays, stating, ""We are disappointed that the expected volume ramp would not materialize for FY ‚Äô26 due to rack architecture changes as we previously announced.‚Äù Crucially, CEO Hou also highlighted the company's extensive collaboration with potential and ""anchor"" customers. ‚ÄúWe remain engaged with over 20 potential customers, including hyperscalers, switch makers and the cable suppliers,‚Äù Hou stated. ""Lastly, based on continued collaboration with our anchor customer [reportedly Nvidia], we expect our CopperEdge portfolio to be included in their future generation rack designs."" The Pending Semtech Securities Class Action CEO Hou‚Äôs acknowledgement of close collaboration, specifically regarding ""rack designs,"" has drawn attention in light of the lawsuit's claims that Semtech failed to disclose necessary rack architecture changes. The suit, filed in the Central District of California, claims the company overstated the product's market readiness and projected ramp-up timeline. The complaint alleges claims on behalf of investors who purchased Semtech securities between August 27, 2024, and February 7, 2025. During this period, Semtech allegedly promoted its CopperEdge portfolio, designed for 400G and 800G data center applications using copper cable and backplane interconnects, asserting it provided ""valuable solutions"" to meet customer demands. The complaint alleges Semtech made ""false and misleading statements"" by failing to disclose key information. Specifically, the suit contends the CopperEdge products did not meet the needs of a key server rack customer, required significant rack architecture modifications, and would not achieve the previously forecast fiscal 2026 ramp-up. The revelation of these issues on February 7, 2025, triggered a sharp market reaction. Semtech disclosed that CopperEdge sales would not ""ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026"" due to ""feedback from a server rack customer,"" ""discussions with end users,"" and the need for ""certain rack architecture changes."" The company further revised its sales projections, indicating CopperEdge revenue would fall below the previously stated $50 million floor. The market‚Äôs response was immediate and severe. On February 10, 2025, Semtech‚Äôs stock price plunged by more than 30%, resulting in a loss of over $1.4 billion in market capitalization in a single trading day, according to market data. The lawsuit seeks damages for investors who suffered losses as a result of the alleged misrepresentations. ‚ÄúThe CEO‚Äôs statements regarding close customer collaboration suggest a need for thorough investigation into the timeline of information sharing between Semtech and its customers,‚Äù said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

2025-04-11 18:13:00,"Treasury Yields Are Soaring Like It's 2008, and Experts Aren't Sure Why","Treasury yields soared on Friday, extending a weeklong run-up that has defied expectations and threatened the Treasury market's status as a safe haven in times of stock market turmoil. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences interest rates on all kinds of consumer loans, rose as high as 4.59% on Friday before retreating slightly. The yield recently stood at 4.5%, 6 basis points above yesterday's close. Treasury yieldssoared this week even as tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, battering the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown. The 10-year yield has skyrocketed more than 50 basis points‚Äîor half a percentage point‚Äîin the last five days, its largest weekly increase since 2008. The bond sell-off‚Äîbond yields and prices are inversely related, meaning yields rise when prices fall‚Äîhas defied standard market logic. Bond prices usually increase when stocks fall as investors pivot to the relative safety of U.S. Treasurys. Bond prices also tend to increase as therisk of recessiongrows more acute; investors, expecting theFederal Reserveto cut interest rates in response to a slowdown, purchase Treasurys to lock in today's comparatively high rates. Experts have pointed toa few possible culpritsfor the bond market's recent volatility. Some point to the potential for Trump's tariffs to nudge inflation higher, which could force the Fed to keep interest rates elevated. Others have speculated that Trump's antagonistic trade and foreign policy has reduced global demand for Treasurys, the world's most widely held sovereign debt. China is one of the largest holders of U.S. debt, and some experts warn it could wreak havoc on the Treasury market by dumping bonds.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/treasury-yields-are-soaring-like-it-is-2008-and-experts-arent-sure-why-11713680,3
2025-04-11 18:18:00,Trump's Unpredictable Tariff Policies Create Stock Market Confusion‚Äîand Opportunity,"President Trump's unpredictable trade policies have pushed stock volatility up to its highest level in years, creating substantial uncertainty and, some say, opportunity on Wall Street. Stock volatility jumped last week when President Trump announced sweeping tariffs that would raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest level in more than a century. TheCboe Volatility Index(VIX), sometimes referred to as the fear index, nearly tripled between Trump‚Äôs tariff announcement last Wednesday andMonday morningwhen stocks opened at their lowest level in more than a year. The VIXhas remained elevateddespitea historic stock rallyon Wednesday when Trump delayed nearly all of the tariffs. The index traded above 40, a level it hit only once in all of 2023 and 2024, for a sixth consecutive day on Friday. The stock market‚Äôs volatility matches the unpredictability of the White House‚Äôs trade policy. Trump has announced, delayed, escalated, and watered down his tariff threats repeatedly during the first months of his presidency, putting businesses and consumers on tenterhooks. Mentions of ‚Äúchaos‚Äù on earnings calls and at corporate conferences haveskyrocketed in recent weeks, according to analysis from data provider AlphaSense. The 90-day pause eliminates some of the risk hanging over markets, according to Kristian Kerr, Head of Macro Strategy at LPL Financial, who noted countries and companies could negotiate lower rates over the next three months. ‚ÄúSo in essence uncertainty has been reduced a bit,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut the erratic nature of US policy will remain an overhang and keep uncertainty elevated versus norms until we get more definitive clarity on trade policy.‚Äù Wall Street expects more twists and turns in the coming months. The 90-day pause ‚Äúmay provide companies with a clearer backdrop for their guidance, offering some relief to a market hungry for direction,‚Äù wrote Gina Bolvin, President of Bolvin Wealth Management in a note on Wednesday. ‚ÄúHowever, uncertainty looms over what happens after the 90-day period, leaving investors to grapple with potential volatility ahead.‚Äù Kerr and Bolvin both recommend investors take the long view. Trading volume hit a record high last Friday and again on Monday, evidence that ‚Äúemotional selling had firmly taken over,‚Äù according to Kerr. ‚ÄúWhen valuations overshoot to irrational extremes, opportunities emerge for investors willing to think long-term,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDislocations like this can present chances to buy solid assets at prices that reflect panic rather than reality.‚Äù ‚ÄúI empathize with those who sold out yesterday and are now watching the rebound from the sidelines,‚Äù Bolvin wrote on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThis underscores the importance of staying fully invested, particularly in a market as reactive and headline-driven as this one.‚Äù",News,https://www.investopedia.com/trump-tariffs-stock-market-volatility-buying-opportunity-11713537,3
2025-04-11 20:01:00,Will Inflation-Weary Consumers Make The Fed‚Äôs Job Harder?,"The ups and downs of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff policies have consumers feeling down and out, a closely followed survey showed Friday. Consumer sentiment fell for the fourth straight month in April, dropping 11%from March, according to theMichigan Consumer Sentiment Index.The reading of 50.8 was well under the 54.6 expected by economists surveyed byDow Jones NewswiresandThe Wall Street Journal,as a wide swath of the U.S. public raised worries about the state of the economy. ‚ÄúConsumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,‚Äù said Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan‚Äôs Survey of Consumers. And that could be bad news for Federal Reserve policymakers, who look at consumer expectations to give them an idea of what's to come. Worries of a growing trade war were the source of the anxiety, Hsu said, coming as President Donald Trump has initiated a number of new tariffs on foreign trading partners, some of which werelater paused. The proposals have generated various responses, fromroller-coaster movementsin the stock market toretaliatory tariffs from Chinaand other trading partners. The report showed that it‚Äôs causing anxiety for nearly everyone. ‚ÄúThis decline was, like the last month‚Äôs, pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation,‚Äù Hsu said. Consumers‚Äô primary worry about tariffs seems to be inflation, as year-ahead expectations for price increases jumped to 6.7%, almost two percentage points higher than last month. This is the worst consumers have felt about inflation since 1981. The increasing consumer inflation expectations defy past historical trends, where people generally became more worried about higher prices as inflation rates rose, noted Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein. However, recent inflation readings show thatprice increases are slowing, including declines in consumer andwholesale inflation ratesthis week. ‚ÄúConsumers are growing increasingly concerned about the coming price environment given how widely tariffs are reaching,‚Äù the Wells Fargo note said. ‚ÄúEven as inflation has moderated over the past year, consumers are more price sensitive today, leaving less cushion for them to take price hikes.‚Äù Elevated inflation worries could be a problem for the Federal Reserve. Officials follow consumers‚Äô feelings about inflation because those inflationexpectations can become self-fulfilling. While tariffs are expected to cause prices to jump for some items, the one-time event could have a limited effect since inflation measures price increases compared to similar points in time, usually looking at the prior month and the past year. ‚ÄúMonetary policymakers may look through a temporary pop in price growth when it comes to setting policy if it feels confident that longer-term inflation expectations are ‚Äòanchored,‚Äô‚Äù the Wells Fargo note said. The inflation expectations are poorly anchored when ""the public reacts to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation by marking up their long-run expectation considerably,"" according to former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke. These decades-high inflation expectations could be a problem, economists said. ""We may not have seen price pressures in the official data in March, but the Fed will have to deal with containing or putting a lid on inflation expectations while, at the same time, dealing with slower growth and, perhaps, potential challenges to their independence,"" wrote BMO Senior Economist Jennifer Lee.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/will-inflation-weary-consumers-make-the-fed-s-job-harder-11713725,4
2025-04-11 20:08:00,Would You Pass Warren Buffett's Hamburger Quiz?,"In a letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) shareholders, legendary investorWarren Buffettonce posed a deceptively simple question: ""If you plan to eat hamburgers throughout your life (and are not a cattle producer), should you wish for higher or lower prices for beef?""The answer is lower, of course. Yet, according to Buffett, this question cuts to the heart of how investors should also think about markets and investing. The ""hamburger quiz"" illustrates Buffett's gift for making complex financial concepts accessible through everyday analogies. His point was clear: just as consumers should prefer lower prices for items they buy regularly, long-term investors should try to see market declines as opportunities, not disasters. We discuss why below‚Äîand it's not about timing the market. Buffett's analogy connects our understanding of consumer behavior to counterintuitivemarket psychology. We instantly recognize that lower beef prices benefit hamburger consumers. Yet when stock prices fall, most investors tend to panic rather than scope out the bargains. He continues with another metaphor: ""Likewise, if you are going to buy a car from time to time but are not an auto manufacturer, should you prefer higher or lower car prices? These questions, of course, answer themselves."" However, Buffett says many investors have the wrong answer when faced with their own version of the hamburger test. ""Even though they are going to be net buyers of stocks for many years to come, they are elated when stock prices rise and depressed when they fall. In effect, they rejoice because prices have risen for the 'hamburgers' they will soon be buying."" Many investors regularly check theirportfolio, feeling better or worse as markets rise and fall. Fighting this natural response demands both intellectual understanding of Buffett's principles and emotional resilience. There are, of course, fundamental differences betweenconsumingandinvesting, with each having entirely different purposes and the means for doing so. Consumption goods like hamburgers provide immediateutilitybut no future return. Their value is realized through use, with nothing left over. Even a car, which can last for many years, steadily loses value and eventually becomes worthless, except maybe for someresidual scrap value. Meanwhile, investing sacrifices the ability to consume today since you're putting that money into a portfolio to generate future returns. The purpose, then, is to create more wealth over time. In short, consumption is about the present; investing is about the future. When you buy a hamburger, your concern ends with a full stomach. But with investments, timing matters tremendously. Market declines only benefit you if prices eventually recover during yourinvestment horizon. Retirees or those short on cash might need to sell off their investments to pay the bills. Thus, when the market declines, that's a real problem, not an opportunity. While Buffett's hamburger principle highlights the opportunity in market downturns, it doesn't mean you should try to time the market. Instead, you can use strategies likedollar-cost averaging‚Äîinvesting fixed amounts regularly no matter the market conditions‚Äîto naturally capitalize on price dips. The hamburger analogy does help focus attention on the psychological reality of watching markets decline. Even long-term investors can struggle to maintain perspective when their portfolio values plummet. Buffett's message thus directly challenges how most people instinctively respond to downturns. ""Smile when you read a headline that says 'Investors lose as market falls,'"" he told Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders. ""Edit it in your mind to 'Disinvestors lose as market falls‚Äîbut investors gain.'"" The hamburger quiz teaches people to treat market downturns as buying opportunities. The challenge it highlights grows more difficult when market declines persist for extended periods. While Buffett's hamburger principle remains insightful, the emotional toll of multiyear bear markets tests even disciplined investors' resolve.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/warren-buffett-s-hamburger-quiz-11712560,3

They upgraded the stock, but cut their price target to $274 from $325 to reflect lowered revenue and earnings forecasts as they expect consumer spending to slow. Bank of America is now one of six ""buy"" ratings among the 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, along with five ""hold"" and two ""sell"" ratings, while its price target is now below the $308.67 consensus. The stock was up 2% at $252 in late trading Friday. ""The macro environment is uncertain and GDP growth is likely slowing,"" the analysts wrote. ""This is a headwind for revenue growth. But we think Amex's high-quality customer base should drive more durable earnings while keeping credit losses in-check."" American Express shares have lost about 15% since the start of the year, which the analysts said ""offers long-term oriented investors an opportunity to buy a high-quality company at a reasonable valuation."" The analysts noted that in prior downturns like the COVID pandemic and the first Trump administration's trade war, American Express stock ""outperformed not only other card issuers but also the S&P 500."" The card issuer is set to report first-quarter earnings on Thursday, and Bank of America analysts said the company's outlook for the rest of 2025 will likely be more important than whether its first-quarter results beat or miss estimates.

Casey's General Stores shares added over 4% Friday to close at $457.25 amidbroader market gains. They have risen nearly 50% over the past year. KeyBanc analysts wrote that Casey's may scoop up more competitors‚Äîit has acquired nearly 470 stores in the past five years‚Äîandbolster their salesby introducing pizza and prepared foods. ""Looking forward, we see balanced growth driven from organic store openings, small acquisitions ... and (at a store level) from its investments in its food innovation pipeline,"" the analysts said. The convenience store industry, which KeyBanc estimates generated 2024 sales of $825 billion, ""has little direct tariff risk,"" it said. But the field is also fragmented and ripe for consolidation, with KeyBanc estimating 75% of chains may go out of business or be acquired by competitors. Much of the sales growth in the gas station sector has come in recent years from snacks, drinks, tobacco and items sold inside convenience stores, KeyBanc said, adding that this is Casey's strength. The company is the fifth-largest pizza chain in the U.S. and growing, analysts said. ""Despite being a convenience store and operating in rural and lower-population markets, Casey's prepared food business produces impressive volume, with (average unit volume) better than Subway,"" the note said, adding: ""Its food innovation pipeline is also gaining sophistication and should drive comp growth.""

Several Fed officials said they expect consumer prices to rise and economic growth to slow, worsening the outlook for both sides of the Fed's ""dual mandate"" to keep inflation low and employment high.Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, spoke withYahoo! FinanceFriday. She said she expects inflation of ""well over 3%"" this year. That would be a setback, considering the Fed's goal is to get inflation to a 2% annual rate, as measured by core Personal Consumption Expenditures. Core PCE increased 2.8% over the year in February.In a separate interview with theFinancial Times, Collins said the central bank ""would absolutely be prepared"" to stabilize financial markets if they became disorderly.Stocksandbondprices have swung wildly in recent days in response toTrump's steep tariffsand his subsequent announcement on Wednesday that he wouldpause most of them for 90 days.Alberto Musalem, president of the St.Louis Fed, said the central bank could use its monetary policy to ""lean against"" tariff-driven price increases. Speaking at a bankers' convention in Arkansas on Friday, Musalem said he was skeptical of the ""textbook"" view that the Fed should ignore tariff-driven price increases because they are, in theory, one-time events.Musalem acknowledged high inflation and a slower economy would put the Fed in a ""challenging"" position.The Federal Reserve's main tool to fight inflation and keep the labor market afloat is changing thefederal funds rate, which influences borrowing costs on all kinds of loans. The Fed can lower the rate to boost the economy with easy money, preventing unemployment. Or, it can raise the rate to reduce borrowing and inflation by allowing supply and demand to rebalance. But it can't do both at the same time. The Fed has kept its rate high in recent months to smother out the last embers of the post-pandemic surge of inflation, which has come down considerably since 2022 but is still more than the Fed's 2% annual target.Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, said the tariffs were likely to cause inflation and economic stagnation at the same time, an economic condition known as ""stagflation.""""Prices are going up while jobs are being lost and growth is coming down,"" Goolsbee said at the Economic Club of New York Thursday.""There is not a generic playbook for how the central bank should respond to a stagflationary shock.""Jeff Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he would prioritize fighting inflation if the Fed were forced to choose between keeping price increases in check and preserving the labor market.""There is a growing possibility that in setting policy, the Fed will have to balance inflation risks against growth and employment concerns,"" Schmid said in a speech to business leaders in Kansas City on Thursday.

After fluctuating for much of the trading day, the S&P 500 rallied in the afternoon to close 1.8% higher. The Dow added 1.6%, and the Nasdaq gained 2.1%. Shares of power management chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) added 10% on Friday, posting the highest increase of any S&P 500 stock. Before its bounce at the end of the volatile week, Monolithic stock had surged 23% Wednesday after President Trump announced a widespread 90-day tariff suspension, but given back a big portion of those gains on Thursday. The price of goldsurged to a record highas the uncertainties surrounding global trade helped lift demand for the precious metal, which is often considered a ""safe haven"" investment. Shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, jumped 7.9%. Goldman Sachs analysts upgraded shares of military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls (HII) to ""buy"" from ""sell"" and lifted their price target. The double upgrade for the stock came in the wake of an executive order signed by President Trump that could that could boost investments in domestic shipyards, with analysts suggesting that upcoming defense budgets could prioritize the construction of U.S.-made Navy vessels. Huntington Ingalls shares steamed 7.4% higher on Friday. Texas Instruments (TXN), which manufactures chips in the U.S., posted the S&P 500's weakest daily performance as shares sank 5.7%.

Here Are Your Highest-Yield Options Right Now,"President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs have rocked the stock market, leading many to bolster their cash reserves. Luckily, cash havens are offering great returns these days. Here are some top rates today: We track returns on all these options every week, letting you choose which ones make the most sense for your money now. The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Giventhe stock market rollercoaster unleashedby President Trump's announcement last week of globe-spanning tariffs, building a solid cash reserve seems increasingly wise. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or shifting funds from stocks into cash vehicles, it's important you consider how much you can earn from different strategies. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds or timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, as well as indicate the change from a week ago. Need to better understand the pros and cons of these different savings vehicles? Below the tables, we describe each one and provide links to more detailed information. This week saw improved rates for several cash instruments, which you can see noted below. The highest yield across categories is the 20-year Treasury bond, which is up to 4.91% today, while 30-year bonds are offering 4.85%. After that, the highest rate comes from two 7-month CDs thatguarantee 4.65% APY. But you can earn upward of 4% with almost all of the options below, giving you plenty of opportunities to put your cash where it makes the most sense for you. Note that the ""top rates"" quoted for savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research of hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is very different from the national average, comprising all institutions offering a CD with that term‚Äîincluding many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, national averages are always low, while the top rates we present are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account‚Äîsometimes called ahigh-yield savings account‚Äîthat lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you15 options paying 4.32% to 4.60% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type‚Äîmoney market or savings‚Äîpays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.40% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includesoptions paying up to 4.65% APY. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.99% to 4.23% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds ""swept"" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- to 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.96% to 4.91%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsdirectly fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect‚Äîthe U.S. Treasury‚Äôs online platform for buying federal government securities‚Äîhas no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. Every six months you own the bond, your rate will change. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

The Monolithic Power Systems class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the class period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits were suffering from significant performance and quality control issues; (ii) these defects had, in turn, negatively impacted the performance of certain products offered by Nvidia in which such products were used; (iii) Monolithic Power Systems had failed to adequately address and resolve known issues affecting the performance of the power management solutions Monolithic Power Systems supplied to Nvidia; (iv) Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô relationship with Nvidia had been irreparably damaged due to the significant performance and quality control problems affecting the products it supplied to Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô failure to adequately address such issues; and (v) as a result of the above, Monolithic Power Systems was acutely exposed to material undisclosed risks of significant business, financial, and reputational harm. On October 30, 2024, Monolithic Power Systems announced financial results for its fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, revealing a sudden and surprising slowdown in Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô critical Enterprise Data segment. Specifically, Monolithic Power Systems reported that quarterly revenue within Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô Enterprise Data business declined sequentially to $184 million, down from $187 million in the prior quarter, missing consensus estimates of $211 million by nearly 13%. On this news, the price of Monolithic Power Systems common stock fell more than 17%. Then, on November 11, 2024, Edgewater Research analysts published a report revealing that Nvidia had cancelled half of its outstanding Monolithic Power Systems orders and intended to eliminate Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô allocation to most variants of its next-generation Blackwell chips due to ‚Äú[p]erformance issues‚Äù with Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô products. The report further disclosed that Nvidia engineers had ‚Äúlost confidence‚Äù in Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô products and decided to turn to Monolithic Power Systems‚Äô competitors as Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúprimary suppliers.‚Äù On this news, the price of Monolithic Power Systems common stock fell nearly 15%.

2025-04-12 12:00:00,Wall Street Is Souring on the S&P 500‚ÄîHere's Where Forecasters See Stocks Ending the Year,"President Trump‚Äôs tariffs haven‚Äôt just rattled the stock market; they‚Äôve also made it nearly impossible to estimate where stocks are headed. Stock volatility jumped to fresh heights when President Trump on Wednesday, just hours after sweeping ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs went into effect, announced a 90-day pause to most of the charges. The pause sparked the S&P 500‚Äôsbiggest rally since 2008days after the index suffered itsworst rout since 2020. The president‚Äôs unpredictable and unprecedented trade policy has amplified uncertainty among investors, businesses, and consumers, leading to sharp declines in each group‚Äôs economic confidence. Wall Street analysts have responded by slashing their stock market forecasts. Four major firms‚ÄîBank of America, Evercore ISI, Oppenheimer, and JPMorgan Chase‚Äîcut their targets on Monday before tariffs were paused. Bank of America and Evercore both lowered their year-end S&P 500 forecasts to 5,600 from 6,666 and 6,800, respectively. Oppenheimer cut its forecast by more than 16% to 5,950. JPMorgan became the most bearish of them all when it slashed its S&P 500 target to 5,200 from 6,500. The uncertainty stemming from tariffs hasn‚Äôt just weighed on expectations; it has also made forecasting more difficult and contributed to a widening gulf between Wall Street‚Äôs optimists and pessimists. At the start of 2025, the 14 firms tracked by CNBC‚Äôs Market Strategist Survey were projecting the S&P 500 would end the year anywhere between 6,500 and 7,100. By this week, the delta between the low and high forecasts had tripled in size from 600 points to 1,800 points. Excluding firms that haven't updated their year-end forecasts, the range has still expanded by 50% to 900 points. On average, analysts still expect stocks to post a third consecutive positive year. The average forecast of 6,056 is about 3% above the S&P 500's level at the end of 2024 and about 13%above its close on Friday. However, updated forecasts tell a different story. Excluding firms that have yet to change their forecasts in light of Trump's tariff and the recent sell-off, the average S&P 500 target is just 5,733, nearly 3% below where the index started the year and 7% above its current level.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/wall-street-is-souring-on-the-s-and-p-500-where-analysts-see-stocks-ending-the-year-now-11713991,4

2025-04-12 22:26:00,Trump administration says it will exclude some electronics from tariffs,"The Trump administration late Friday said they would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren‚Äôt usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia and sets the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won‚Äôt be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It‚Äôs the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The exemption seemed to reflect the president‚Äôs realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration‚Äôs predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What‚Äôs more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump‚Äôs decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech‚Äôs ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point earlier this week, the combined Magnificent Seven‚Äôs combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries.    Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. Now, the stage is set for another tech rally Monday when trading resumes in the U.S. stock market, with Apple likely leading the way because the iPhones made in China remain the company‚Äôs biggest money maker. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It‚Äôs the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech‚Äôs hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration‚Äôs and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump‚Äôs first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off ‚Äúa huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,‚Äù said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

2025-04-13 12:18:00,Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?,"President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined.getty Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4.  Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced.  Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950Glenview Trust, Strategas Market Performance The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week‚Äôs rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high.  Market PerformanceGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Bond Yields Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was ‚Äúgetting a little queasy‚Äù when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday.  MORE FOR YOUNetflix‚Äôs Best New Show Nabs A Perfect 100% Critic ScoreFed Official Confirms Trump Tariff Bailout Is Ready Amid $30 Trillion Market ‚ÄòPanic‚Äô WarningGmail And Microsoft 2FA Security Bypass ‚Äî Take Action Now, Users Told  Why Did U.S. Treasury Yields Rise? Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield DecompositionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg   Unwinding Of Large Treasury Swap Trades The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher.US Swap SpreadGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023.US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse PeriodGlenview Trust, Bloomberg There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. Selling By Other Countries The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries‚Äô currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.US Dollar WeaknessGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. What To Watch This Week The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday‚Äôs retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter‚Äôs earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation.S&P 500 Earnings SeasonGlenview Trust, FactSet The Only Thing We Have To Fear Is Fear Itself ‚Äî Franklin D. Roosevelt The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside.Volatility RiskGlenview Trust, Bloomberg What‚Äôs Next For Stocks? Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time.Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day GainsGlenview Trust, Strategas Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing.Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day GainsGlenview Trust, Strategas It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock‚Äôs dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

2025-04-13 16:27:00,Could the exemption actually be bad for big tech,"Lutnick said today that the exemptions were done so that the exempted items could be included in the coming semiconductor tariffs (in the next month or two), and that the metric for this was so that those tariffs would not be negotiable because they are important for national security. And that this same situation applies to pharmaceuticals.

To me this sounds like he is saying everything not exempted (the stuff still tariffed at 145%) is negotiable, but semiconductors and pharmaceuticals won‚Äôt be negotiable when their new tariffs come.

Like the rest of the world I think Monday will be big green for AAPL, NVDA, etc.  and that the rising tide will probably lift all ships, but in the long run this actually sounds like really bad news for big tech.  There is practically no chance to manufacture those things in the US anytime soon or for a reasonable price and if these tariffs are truly non-negotiable these companies longer term outlook may be very bad.

I have long straddles on tech, pharma, airlines, and some defense btw, so I don‚Äôt really care if things go up or down just that things continue to swing.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jybkss/could_the_exemption_actually_be_bad_for_big_tech/,4
2025-04-13 21:58:00,Special chip tariffs coming,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. ‚Äî Tariff exemptions announced on electronics like smartphones and laptops last week are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they‚Äôre included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,‚Äù Lutnick told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù on Sunday. President Donald Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no ‚Äúexception‚Äù at all because the goods are ‚Äújust moving to a different‚Äù bucket and will still face a 20% tariff as part of his administration‚Äôs move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer¬†devices that aren‚Äôt usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won‚Äôt be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It‚Äôs the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick‚Äôs comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was ‚Äútaking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.‚Äù    The administration has predicted that the trade war would prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What‚Äôs more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech‚Äôs ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven‚Äôs combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning¬†when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech‚Äôs hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump‚Äôs first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes ‚Äúa huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,‚Äù said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick‚Äôs comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House ‚Äúis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.‚Äù Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Originally Published: April 13, 2025 at 5:58 PM EDT",News,https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/13/special-chip-tariffs-coming/,4
2025-04-14 02:31:00,"Trump & Lutnick‚Äôs Semiconductor Tariff Chaos: A Bull Trap, Insider Trading, and Market Manipulation Exposed","Alright, Reddit, buckle up because we‚Äôre diving into the absolute rollercoaster that is Trump‚Äôs tariff policy on semiconductors, spearheaded by his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This is a wild ride of mixed signals, market swings, and what smells like blatant manipulation to make billionaires richer while the rest of us get played. If you‚Äôre in the markets or just curious about how the sausage gets made in DC, you need to read this. Monday‚Äôs announcement is going to be a doozy, and I‚Äôm calling it now: we‚Äôre staring down a potential disaster for the semiconductor industry, a textbook bull trap, and some seriously shady insider trading vibes.

Let‚Äôs start with the Friday bombshell. On April 11, 2025, the **Trump administration** dropped a *memo* that had Wall Street doing cartwheels: semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, and a bunch of other electronics were exempted from the massive ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs Trump slapped on China (we‚Äôre talking 125% levies‚Äîinsane). The U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin listed **20 product categories, including memory chips, disc drives, and flat panel displays, all getting a free pass.** Tech stocks like Apple, Dell, and NVIDIA went nuts. The S&P 500 was already down 10% since Trump took office, so this felt like a lifeline. Futures soared, X was buzzing with ‚Äúbull market confirmed‚Äù takes, and everyone thought we were headed for a recovery rally. I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt be bullish? It looked like Trump was giving Big Tech a massive break.

But then, Sunday morning hits, and **Howard Lutnick** goes on ABC‚Äôs This Week and basically says, **‚ÄúPsych!‚Äù** He clarified that those exemptions? Yeah, they‚Äôre *temporary.* Semiconductors and electronics are still getting hit with **‚Äúsector-specific‚Äù** tariffs in **‚Äúa month or two,‚Äù** tied to national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These aren‚Äôt negotiable, unlike the reciprocal tariffs. Lutnick‚Äôs exact words: ‚ÄúThese are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.‚Äù Suddenly, the whole narrative flips. The Friday exemption wasn‚Äôt a win‚Äîit was a head fake. And now, Monday‚Äôs announcement is looming, where Trump‚Äôs expected to double down on these semiconductor tariffs, potentially spelling chaos for the industry.

Let‚Äôs talk about why this is a big deal for semiconductors. The global chip supply chain is insanely complex. Most semiconductors are designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan (TSMC, anyone?), and assembled or finished in places like China. If Trump slaps tariffs on chips coming from China‚Äîor worse, starts a national security probe that messes with the whole supply chain‚Äîprices are going to spike. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm are going to take a hit, not to mention downstream players like Apple, who assemble iPhones in China. Lutnick‚Äôs pushing this ‚Äúre-shore to America‚Äù narrative, but building chip fabs in the U.S. takes years and billions of dollars. TSMC‚Äôs Arizona plant isn‚Äôt even fully online yet! In the meantime, costs go up, supply chains choke, and consumers get stuck with pricier gadgets‚Äîor straight-up shortages.

Now, let‚Äôs get to the bull trap. Friday‚Äôs exemption announcement was like **catnip for traders.** Everyone piled into tech stocks, thinking the tariff threat was gone. But Lutnick‚Äôs Sunday comments yanked the rug out. Posts on X were already screaming about it: ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs exemptions weren‚Äôt surrender‚Äîthey were a setup,‚Äù one user said. Another called it a ‚Äúheadline-driven market‚Äù where the administration is ‚Äústeering price action.‚Äù If Monday‚Äôs announcement confirms heavy tariffs, those bullish bets from Friday are going to get crushed. We could see a brutal sell-off in semiconductor stocks, dragging the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down with it. The market‚Äôs already been a mess‚Äîwildest swings since COVID, down 10% since January 20. This could be the trap that catches all the dip-buyers off guard.

And here‚Äôs where it gets really ugly: the insider trading and market manipulation angle. Let‚Äôs rewind to April 9, when Trump posted on Truth Social, **‚ÄúTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,‚Äù** just hours before he announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries (except China). The S&P 500 surged 9%, Nasdaq jumped 12.2%, and Trump Media‚Äôs stock shot up 22%. Coincidence? Democrats like Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters aren‚Äôt buying it. They‚Äôre calling for SEC investigations, saying Trump‚Äôs post reeks of insider trading. Schiff‚Äôs letter to the White House asked who knew about the tariff pause beforehand and whether anyone traded on it. When Trump was asked when he decided on the pause, he was cagey: ‚ÄúOver the last few days‚Ä¶ probably came together early this morning.‚Äù Yeah, right.

Fast forward to this weekend‚Äôs semiconductor flip-flop, and it‚Äôs d√©j√† vu. Friday‚Äôs exemption pumps the market, Lutnick‚Äôs Sunday reversal sets up a crash, and Monday‚Äôs announcement could be the knockout punch. The timing is too convenient. Billionaires like Bill Ackman, who‚Äôs been cozy with Trump but criticized tariffs, are probably sitting pretty, knowing the playbook. Meanwhile, retail traders who went all-in on Friday are about to get smoked. It‚Äôs not just Trump‚Äôs Truth Social posts‚ÄîLutnick‚Äôs been all over TV, hyping tariffs one day, backtracking the next. The mixed signals aren‚Äôt just chaotic; they‚Äôre starting to look deliberate. As one X post put it, ‚ÄúThe biggest rally of the year would come on the day Lutnick gets fired.‚Äù That‚Äôs the vibe right now.

Why does this matter? Because semiconductors are the backbone of everything. Your phone, your car, your fridge‚Äîthey all need chips. If Trump and Lutnick tank the industry with tariffs, it‚Äôs not just stock prices that suffer. Inflation‚Äôs already a worry (economists have been screaming about tariffs spiking prices), and chip shortages could make 2021‚Äôs supply chain mess look like a picnic. Plus, China‚Äôs not sitting still‚Äîthey hiked their own tariffs to 125% on Friday and are ‚Äúevaluating‚Äù Trump‚Äôs exemptions. This could spiral into a full-blown trade war, and guess who pays the price? Not the billionaires with their offshore accounts‚Äîus.

So, what‚Äôs the play here? Brace yourself. Monday‚Äôs announcement could confirm tariffs that gut semiconductor stocks and ripple through tech. If you‚Äôre holding NVIDIA or TSMC, maybe hedge with some puts. Cash is king if the market tanks. And keep an eye on X and Truth Social‚ÄîTrump‚Äôs posts are basically market signals now, legal or not. The bigger picture? This administration‚Äôs tariff policy is a clown show, and Lutnick‚Äôs either in over his head or part of the game. Either way, the semiconductor world‚Äôs about to get rocked, and not in a good way.What do you all think? Are we headed for a crash? Is this insider trading staring us in the face?

Drop your takes below‚ÄîI‚Äôm all ears.

**TL;DR:** Trump‚Äôs Friday exemption for semiconductors was a head fake that pumped the market. Lutnick‚Äôs Sunday reversal sets up a brutal Monday announcement that could crush the chip industry. This smells like a bull trap, with insider trading and market manipulation letting Trump‚Äôs billionaire buddies cash in while retail gets screwed. Semiconductors are about to take a beating‚Äîwatch out.

2025-04-14 05:42:00,Today Trump Wakes Up to a Green Market. Bulls Might Regret It.,"Don‚Äôt be surprised if Trump wakes up tomorrow, sees the market green, and thinks: ‚ÄúGuess I didn‚Äôt scare them enough.‚Äù

No one really reacted to his half-denial about removing tariffs on chips, semiconductors, and computers which, let‚Äôs be honest, sounded more like confusion than policy. If anything, it only made things murkier. And when Trump gets ignored, what does he usually do? Doubles down. More tariffs? Wouldn‚Äôt be shocking.

Meanwhile, China just pulled the plug on rare earth exports. You know, the critical materials needed to make every chip, missile, EV, and iPhone. Trump tried to get Ukraine to help supply these metals last year. It didn‚Äôt work. And China knows exactly how vital this is to U.S. tech dominance.

All major tech players from NVIDIA to Apple rely on these resources. So yes, while the market is green for now, don‚Äôt mistake silence for safety. This might be the setup ‚Äî not the relief.

Bulls are walking into a trap with smiles on their faces.
I hope some of you at least get out with a profit before the hammer drops.

Good luck everyone.

More March 06, 2025 in Barcelona, Spain. (Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images)Getty Images Trefis  Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) has reached a critical support level that has held historical significance. This price range saw nearly ten years of consolidation from 2004 to 2014 before the stock began trending higher, indicating strong buying interest around current levels.  This support seems solid, as shown by the stock‚Äôs ability to hold up following a sharp 30%+ decline in August 2024. While the length of this consolidation is unknown, Intel at $20 presents a compelling value case, though investors should remain mindful of associated risks.   For those seeking gains with lower volatility than individual stocks, check out the High-Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception. INTC Stock Price HistoryTrefis  INTC is available dirt cheap Intel‚Äôs current valuation reflects its recent performance struggles. The company is facing negative revenue growth, while competitors AMD, QCOM, and NVDA are enjoying double-digit increases. With negative earnings, Intel trades at a Price to Sales ratio of just 1.8, versus 6.5 for AMD, 4.2 for QCOM, and 20.3 for Nvidia. This may make Intel more appealing as a long-term value play than a short-term growth bet.  Where is that value going to come from? There are several potential catalysts that could unlock value for Intel:  Recent leadership changes could refocus efforts on Intel‚Äôs core CPU operations and enhance its role in the AI sector. See ‚Äì Is A New CEO Enough To Get Intel Back On Track?

2025-04-14 11:57:00,The Most Important Number on Your 401(k) Statement (It's Not Your Balance),"Your 401(k) balance is important, but it‚Äôs not the best indicator of whether you‚Äôre on track for retirement. Instead, yourrate of returntells you how efficiently your investments are growing over time. A strong return means your money is working harder for you‚Äîregardless of short-term market fluctuations. Understanding this number can help you make smarter decisions and maximize your savings. Here‚Äôs why your rate of return matters, how to interpret it, and what to do if yours seems a bit low. Your401(k) balanceonly tells you how much money is in your account today. It‚Äôs a snapshot in time. Your rate of return, on the other hand, reflects how your investments have performed over time. It accounts for market fluctuations and is typically calculated on an annual basis. Even if the market dips, a solid rate of return means you're still on track. ""I don't want to minimize the importance of balance because, ultimately, if your balance isn't big enough, you may not be able to spend enough,"" said Chris Kampitsis, a Wealth Advisor and Financial Services Executive atBarnum Financial Group. ""But rate of return ultimately indicates how hard your money is working for you. As investors, we want our money compounding, earning interest, and growing over the years."" Many investors misjudge their returns, often comparing them to others or to benchmarks like theS&P 500. Here are some common mistakes: ‚ÄúVery often investors will focus on their rate of return in comparison to the person at the cubicle or office next to them. They might compare in comparison to a benchmark like the stock market, i.e., the S&P 500. But they don't necessarily give context to their particular asset allocation,"" Kampitsis explained. ""So that's not a fair measuring stick to hold yourself to."" Instead of comparing your rate of return to others, focus on whether your investments align with yourlong-term retirement goals. Your personal comfort level withrisk toleranceand the stage of life you're in can directly influence how aggressive or conservative your portfolio should be. You may face a choice between taking on more risk for higher long-term returns or opting for a more conservative approach that sacrifices some growth for stability. ""In general, our rate of return should compensate us for the level of risk we‚Äôre taking on over the long term,"" Kampitsis explained. ""A more aggressive, more equity-focused investor should have a higher long-term rate of return, but they will also have much more deviation from that long-term average in any one or two given years."" Adjusting yourrisk tolerancebased on short-term market conditions can backfire. Selling assets in a downturn locks in losses, while staying invested allows for recovery. If you‚Äôre concerned about your rate of return, consider these steps. ‚ÄúNumber one, we want to figure out why it's under-performing,"" says Kampitsis. He recommends that investors look at their invested funds and how each is performing versus their benchmarks, not just the S&P 500. Also, check if your plan includes high-fee or under-performing funds. ""Most 401(k) plans havefiduciary oversight, so funds should be monitored for reasonable fees and performance,"" says Kampitsis. ""But it's not always the case. Not every menu is going to be perfect. Some funds will under-perform, that's just how that works."" Make sure yourinvestment mixaligns with your risk tolerance. Asset allocation refers to how your portfolio is divided among asset classes, like stocks, bonds, and cash. Be cautious withtarget-date fundsas they may shift too conservative, too soon. Your 401(k) is designed for decades, not short-term gains. Try to avoid‚Äúemotional investing,‚Äùwhich can lead to buying high and selling low. ‚ÄúWhat is your distance to retirement and how long do you anticipate your retirement lasting once you're there? While some of your money you will spend the first day of retirement, it's important to remember that this is still a very long term journey,‚Äù Kampitsis warned. Even a strong rate of return can be eroded by fees and taxes. 401(k) fees reduce your earnings over time, especially if your plan hashigh expense ratios. Taxes on withdrawals can also impact your net income, especially if you‚Äôre in a higher tax bracket. ""Fees are definitely a major component because ultimately that does represent a drag on our rate of return that, when compounded over many years, is a substantial number,"" Kampitsis noted. ""Taxes similarly can ultimately be a huge impediment to us netting the right amount of money that we need."" If you‚Äôre unsure about your 401(k) fees or tax implications, a financial planner can help you optimize your strategy. Your 401(k) rate of return is one of the most important numbers on your statement because it shows how effectively your money is growing. Rather than comparing your returns to others, focus on your own investment mix and long-term goals. If your returns seem low, take a closer look at your fund choices, risk level, and fees. To reduce the impact of taxes and fees, considerRoth contributionsanddiversification. If you review your 401(k) regularly and make thoughtful adjustments, you can stay on track and build a more secure retirement.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/importance-of-rate-of-return-in-401k-11701096,4

(Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)VCG via Getty Images Trefis  Why would you pay 38x earnings for IBM stock when Microsoft stock is available at just 30x? The comparison becomes even more favorable for Microsoft when considering three key factors:   Superior Growth Trajectory: Microsoft has delivered strong growth averaging over 12% annually for the past three years, significantly ahead of IBM‚Äôs sub-3% rate. This growth gap indicates a more promising return outlook for Microsoft shareholders. Impressive Profit Margins: Microsoft boasts operating margins above 45%, meaning a greater portion of revenue reaches shareholders. In contrast, IBM‚Äôs figure stands at just 16%. Tariff Resilience: Both Microsoft and IBM are less exposed to tariff risks compared to hardware-centric tech firms, thanks to their substantial software businesses. This offers some protection from global trade tensions. Furthermore, the Trump administration recently announced tariff exemptions for several high-tech imports, such as smartphones, laptops, semiconductor gear, and other electronics. Microsoft too boring? Consider this - Tesla Stock Plummets 50%: More To Go?  Is Microsoft A Safe Bet? Microsoft is not immune to market volatility. The stock dropped from nearly $450 in January to under $360 last week, though it has since recovered to around $390. It also declined 36% during the 2022 inflation shock and 28% in the 2020 Covid-19 selloff. Thus, MSFT is not exactly a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù stock. For a more balanced strategy, the Trefis High Quality portfolio has delivered strong results, returning over 91% since launch‚Äîoutpacing broader benchmarks.   Strategic Position In AI And Cloud Microsoft plays a central role in the AI revolution through its Azure cloud services. Just as Nvidia powers AI with GPUs, Azure supplies the necessary infrastructure‚Äîprocessing power, storage, and networking‚Äîthat enables AI innovation across enterprises, including key customers like OpenAI.  By investing in Microsoft, shareholders gain exposure to the broader AI trend without needing to predict which applications will dominate. Microsoft underpins the technological foundation of AI growth, making it a strong contender for long-term value creation.

2025-04-14 12:15:00,Will You Outlive Your Savings? Here's How to Boost Your Longevity Literacy,"As Americans juggle the rising cost of living, the decline of pensions, longer lifespans, and other complex factors, median retirement savings stand at only $82,000‚Äîfar below the $1.5 million that Americans believe is enough to retire comfortably. Taking the time to improve your longevity literacy can be worth the effort‚Äîit could help you get your retirement on track. Here's what you need to know. Longevity literacy is knowing how long you're likely to live, particularly in relation to retirement planning. It includes knowing not just life expectancy averages but also the likelihood of living past certain ages and the financial implications of an increased lifespan for your quality of life in retirement. Some experts believe that those with low longevity literacy tend to be less financially secure than they might think. In fact, a 2023 TIAA Institute survey found that most American adults have poor longevity literacy‚Äîmeaning they couldn't tell you the life expectancy of a 60-year-old in the U.S. The TIAA Institute says its mortality tables factor in a tendency toward longer life expectancy due to factors such as education level, type of work a person did, the amount they made, and their access to medical care. According to their data, they assume a 67-year-old will live, on average, another 23 years, with a 25% chance of living 28 years and a 10% chance of making it all the way to age 100. That means saving more for retirement than many people do. To answer the question of how long you're going to live, you can use a life expectancy calculator, like the oneprovided by the Social Security administration. Simply enter your sex and date of birth, and you'll learn how many years, on average, you have left, and the age you'll be when you die. This information, while a bit morbid, is crucial forretirement planning. But be aware it may underestimate your number based on all the same factors that TIAA takes into account. Knowing your number will help you build financial resilience and cultivate a stronger quality of life. ‚ÄúThe years you spend planning for and living in retirement are two fundamentally different seasons of your life‚Äîand can be equally long,‚Äù says Michael Kuplic, CRPC, a financial advisor at Ameriprise. The following tips can help you build a healthy nest egg and be better prepared for the number of years you'll be in retirement. While it‚Äôs easier said than done, contributing more to your savings account will help bridge the gap between your targeted amount and the actual outcome. To do so, it‚Äôs important to set up a plan based on how you would like to live in retirement. ‚ÄúWhile having enough money for retirement is important, it is also imperative to ask yourself,What am I retiring to?‚Äù, Kuplic says. ‚ÄúKnowing what you truly want and need out of retirement is the first step in designing a specific plan to turn those wishes into action.‚Äù Auto-enrollment plansare another avenue for building your retirement savings. You can structure these so that contribution amounts auto-escalate over time. As a general rule of thumb, try to contributeat least 15% of your paycheck. At minimum, contribute enough to qualify for your employer'smatching contribution. Working for longer is a great way to build financial stability in retirement. You might expand your skillset, move into a consultant-type role, or take on part-time opportunities. Working in your '60s isn't uncommon. According to a study from the Pew Research Center, about one in five (nearly 20%) of American workers are 65 or older. That's nearly double what it was three decades ago.And those age 65 and older report greater job satisfaction compared to younger generations. Making the most out of your retirement savings involves adjusting your investment strategy based on your life stage. ‚ÄúThese two phases have fundamentally different goals, risks, and complexities, often needing separate investing and financial planning strategies,‚Äù Kuplic says. Equities historically offer higher returns than bonds. You can afford to place more of yourdiversifiedportfolio in stocks when you're younger. As you age, you'll need to shift the mix toward bonds. For example, short-term bonds can provide an income stream in retirement. It may be a good idea to consult a financial professional to guide you. As lifespans grow longer, the average expected retirement age among people who haven't retired yet is rising. In 2022, it was 66 years old (compared to 60 years old in 1995), according to a Gallup poll.By contributing more to your retirement account(s), working longer, and investing based on yourlife stage, you can improve your chances of success during your retirement years.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/longevity-literacy-11707394,4

2025-04-14 12:36:00,Semtech (SMTC) CEO Acknowledges CopperEdge Delays Amid Investor Lawsuit ‚Äì Hagens Berman," SAN FRANCISCO, April  14, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ: SMTC) is navigating a turbulent period, facing a securities class-action lawsuit alleging investor deception regarding its CopperEdge product line. Recent comments from the company‚Äôs CEO during the Q4 2025 earnings call have brought the company's close relationships with key customers into sharper focus, raising questions about prior awareness of product-related challenges. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased Semtech securities and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Aug. 27, 2024 ‚Äì Feb. 7, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Apr. 22, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/smtc Contact the Firm Now: SMTC@hbsslaw.com ¬†¬† 844-916-0895 Semtech‚Äôs Customer Relationships at Center of CopperEdge Delayed Ramp: The lawsuit, Kleovoulos v. Semtech Corporation, et al., centers on claims that Semtech misled investors about the readiness and projected ramp-up of CopperEdge, a critical component for advanced data center interconnects. During the March 13, 2025, earnings call, CEO Hong Hou acknowledged delays, stating, ""We are disappointed that the expected volume ramp would not materialize for FY ‚Äô26 due to rack architecture changes as we previously announced.‚Äù Crucially, CEO Hou also highlighted the company's extensive collaboration with potential and ""anchor"" customers. ‚ÄúWe remain engaged with over 20 potential customers, including hyperscalers, switch makers and the cable suppliers,‚Äù Hou stated. ""Lastly, based on continued collaboration with our anchor customer [reportedly Nvidia], we expect our CopperEdge portfolio to be included in their future generation rack designs."" The Pending Semtech Securities Class Action CEO Hou‚Äôs acknowledgement of close collaboration, specifically regarding ""rack designs,"" has drawn attention in light of the lawsuit's claims that Semtech failed to disclose necessary rack architecture changes. The suit, filed in the Central District of California, claims the company overstated the product's market readiness and projected ramp-up timeline. The complaint alleges claims on behalf of investors who purchased Semtech securities between August 27, 2024, and February 7, 2025. During this period, Semtech allegedly promoted its CopperEdge portfolio, designed for 400G and 800G data center applications using copper cable and backplane interconnects, asserting it provided ""valuable solutions"" to meet customer demands. The complaint alleges Semtech made ""false and misleading statements"" by failing to disclose key information. Specifically, the suit contends the CopperEdge products did not meet the needs of a key server rack customer, required significant rack architecture modifications, and would not achieve the previously forecast fiscal 2026 ramp-up. The revelation of these issues on February 7, 2025, triggered a sharp market reaction. Semtech disclosed that CopperEdge sales would not ""ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026"" due to ""feedback from a server rack customer,"" ""discussions with end users,"" and the need for ""certain rack architecture changes."" The company further revised its sales projections, indicating CopperEdge revenue would fall below the previously stated $50 million floor. The market‚Äôs response was immediate and severe. On February 10, 2025, Semtech‚Äôs stock price plunged by more than 30%, resulting in a loss of over $1.4 billion in market capitalization in a single trading day, according to market data. The lawsuit seeks damages for investors who suffered losses as a result of the alleged misrepresentations. ‚ÄúThe CEO‚Äôs statements regarding close customer collaboration suggest a need for thorough investigation into the timeline of information sharing between Semtech and its customers,‚Äù said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

2025-04-14 15:40:07,Forbes Recession Tracker: White House Promises No Recession This Year‚ÄîAs Hedge Fund Billionaire Warns Of ‚ÄòSomething Worse‚Äô,"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday the bank‚Äôs research team does not expect to see a recession in 2025 after President Donald Trump‚Äôs ever-changing tariff policies accelerated fears of a sharp downturn, though some of the most trusted observers of the economy say the U.S. is far from able to declare victory on a tariff-driven recession. NEW YORK, NEW YORK: Bank Of America CEO Brian Moynihan is interviewed by Jack Otter during ""Barron's ... More Roundtable"" at Fox Business Network Studios on January 09, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images)Getty Images  Key Facts   Moynihan cautioned that much could ‚Äú potentially change given the uncertainty around the tariffs and other policies in the future path of the economy,‚Äù and noted that the bank still lowered its GDP forecast for the year and does not expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates in 2025.    Other big banks‚Äô economic models still indicate the chance of a recession remains a tossup, as Morgan Stanley forecasts 40% odds of a recession in 2025, Goldman Sachs places 45% likelihood of a recession over the next year and JPMorgan Chase projects 60% chance of a 2025 recession.    National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business' ‚ÄúMornings With Maria‚Äù Monday he is ‚Äú100% not‚Äù expecting a recession in 2025, explaining recent discussions with CEOs indicated the ‚Äúuncertainty over tariffs‚Äù won‚Äôt be ‚Äúa big drag‚Äù on the economy.    Though the Trump administration‚Äôs backdown last week from its most aggressive tariffs alleviated concerns the U.S. was on the cusp of a recession, Hassett‚Äôs confidence is far from a consensus view among Wall Street bigwigs and prominent economists.   Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said in a Sunday interview with NBC News: ‚ÄúRight now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession, and I‚Äôm worried about something worse than a recession if this isn‚Äôt handled well.‚Äù   Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary during President Bill Clinton‚Äôs term, said in a Monday editorial podcast in The New York Times he believes it‚Äôs ‚Äúsix in 10 or better that a recession will start this year,‚Äù explaining: ‚ÄúThe pause is certainly better than if we had simply charged along on the catastrophic path that we‚Äôre on, but anybody who thinks the genie is back in the bottle and that it‚Äôs all now OK should reconsider their position.‚Äù   Last week, Summers predicted such a downturn would leave an additional 2 million Americans unemployed, a more than 28% increase from the 7.1 million unemployed Americans in March, and a $5,000 or greater decline in annual household income.   Moody's Analytics Mark Zandi said Monday on ‚ÄúCNN News Central‚Äù he sees the U.S. sinking into a recession over the next ‚Äúthree, four‚Äù weeks if the policy uncertainty is still ‚Äúvery thick,‚Äù saying he hopes ‚Äúthe president and the administration kind of finds an off ramp here and the trade war de-escalates.‚Äù     News Peg ‚ÄúThe prospect of a recession has increased,‚Äù Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a Monday earnings call. ‚ÄúOur clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors are concerned by the significant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions,‚Äù continued Solomon. Jamie Dimon‚Äôs Recession Warnings Influenced Trump‚Äôs Pause In a Wednesday morning interview just hours before Trump paused many of the more than 10% country-by-country levies, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told ‚ÄúMornings With Maria‚Äù he believed a tariff-spurred recession is ‚Äúprobably‚Äù a ‚Äúlikely outcome,‚Äù adding he‚Äôs heard ‚Äúrecessionary talk‚Äù in conversations with other business leaders. Trump said the comments from Dimon, the head of the nation‚Äôs largest bank by assets and market value, partially inspired his pause. Economists at JPMorgan had labeled Trump‚Äôs policies as the ‚Äúlargest tax increase‚Äù since 1968 which will ‚Äúfall heavily on the US consumer.‚Äù In JPMorgan‚Äôs earnings call Friday, Dimon repeated his pushback against Trump‚Äôs targeting of allies in his trade war, explaining the ‚Äúmost important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically.‚Äù  Stock Market Signals Slowdown Fears Stock prices don‚Äôt completely correlate with economic growth, but equity investors are clearly pricing still in significantly increased odds of a down stretch for the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 briefly dove into a 20% bear market last week, wiping out about $10 trillion in market value, led by stocks considered the most vulnerable to a slowdown, including artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla. But markets are still pricing ‚Äúnowhere close to the worst case‚Äù scenario, Bhanu Baweja, UBS Investment Bank‚Äôs chief strategist, said last Monday. Even after the post-pause recovery, the S&P is still down 12% from its February peak. Trump Administration Prepared Americans For The Possibility Of A Recession Ahead of the ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù announcement last week, Trump braced Americans for a possible recession. In a Fox News interview aired March 9, he would not rule out the possibility of a recession, cautioning Americans for a period of economic ‚Äútransition‚Äù as his policies take hold and noting he‚Äôs paying little attention to stock market losses. In subsequent media appearances, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent similarly declined to dismiss a potential recession and said the U.S. will go through a ‚Äúdetox period.‚Äù Bessent told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù in an interview he believes it ‚Äúwould have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes‚Äù on ahead of the Great Recession. ‚ÄúBe Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!,‚Äù Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Monday. What Needs To Happen To Gdp To Trigger A Recession (it‚Äôs Not Negative‚Äîyet) The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, a comprehensive measure of all goods and services produced in a country. The official quarterly GDP stats haven't turned negative yet, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve's real-time model ignited concerns by calling for -1.8% annual GDP growth in 2025's first quarter, which would be the worst reading since 2020‚Äîthough the estimate is likely skewed by its methodology, including how it accounts for a surge in gold imports. Bond Market Is Shaky‚Äîbut Yield Curve‚Äôs Still Intact Elsewhere in financial markets, a flight to government-issued debt is evidence of a thirst for safer returns in the face of a potential recession, as yields for benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds have dropped by 40 basis points over the past three months (lower yields mean bonds got more valuable). But the most common bond market signal of a recession, the inversion of the yield curve, in which longer-term bonds have lower yields than shorter-dated ones, has actually normalized in recent months. The New York Fed‚Äôs bond-linked recession model calls for just 30% recession odds over the next year, down from the more than 70% odds in late 2023, a period which failed to materialize into a full-blown recession.  Consumer Confidence Signals Americans Bracing For Tough Times Perhaps the most concerning signal over the last is a breakdown in everyday Americans‚Äô conviction in the economy, as the Conference Board‚Äôs closely watched consumer confidence survey tumbled this month to its lowest level since 2021. That tracks with weaker spending, as February retail sales grew by just 0.2% from January to February, according to a report released March 17 by the Census Bureau, far worse than the 0.6% month-over-month increase projected by economists. Unemployment Rate Is Still Fine One of the most important hallmarks of the American economy, the labor market has shown some cracks in early 2025 as job creation slowed and layoffs spiked, but remains overwhelmingly strong, as March‚Äôs 4.2% unemployment rate sits well within the healthy historic norm. A key labor market recession indicator, the Sahm rule, flashes a far lower likelihood of a recession than it did when it peaked last summer, inspiring a short-lived market selloff in August. Gold And Oil Prices Hint At Potential Global Slowdown Trading in two of the world‚Äôs most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 10% this year to a record $3,200 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. What To Watch For Bessent and Trump have made clear they are lasered in on lowering interest rates, which are determined by the politically independent Fed. Typically, rates are only drastically cut during periods of economic distress, as lower rates typically stimulate economic growth as households and businesses are more likely to borrow with lower interest costs, though that uptick in loan activity can simultaneously lead to higher inflation as demand rises. The Fed is likely to hold off on further rate cuts ‚Äúuntil tariff policy becomes clearer,‚Äù according to David Mericle, Goldman‚Äôs chief U.S. economist.

2025-04-14 16:28:00,Intel to Sell 51% Altera Stake to Silver Lake Amid Cost Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. has agreed to sell a 51% stake in its programmable chips unit Altera to Silver Lake Management, making good on plans to start spinning off non-core assets. Most Read from Bloomberg The Secret Formula for Faster Trains NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City‚Äôs Housing Shortage The transaction values Altera at $8.75 billion, according to a statement on Monday, about half what Intel paid for it a decade ago. Intel will continue to hold a 49% stake in the business. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Bloomberg reported previously on the talks between the two companies. Intel will receive about $3.4 billion in cash from Silver Lake as part of the deal, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Altera will be run by Raghib Hussain, replacing Sandra Rivera as chief executive officer. Hussain will join from Marvell Technology Inc., where he‚Äôs president of products and technologies. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,‚Äù said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. Silver Lake has a track record in investing in semiconductors companies. It was an early backer of Broadcom Inc‚Äôs acquisition strategy. ‚ÄúThis investment represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in a scale leader in advanced semiconductors,‚Äù said Kenneth Hao, chairman and managing partner of Silver Lake, who added that under new leadership Altera will be focused on investing in ‚Äúemerging AI-driven markets such as edge computing and robotics.‚Äù Shares of Intel rose as much as 6.6% after markets opened in New York. Intel agreed in 2015 to pay $16.7 billion for Altera, whose multiuse chips are primarily deployed in telecommunications networks. In 2024, the US chipmaker said it would look to sell a stake in Altera ‚Äî part of a broader plan to turn its business around. Altera drew interest from Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and a group of buyout firms, Bloomberg News has reported. Intel has lost market share to rivals in recent years and missed the shift to artificial intelligence accelerators, a market now dominated by Nvidia Corp. Intel‚Äôs board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger last year after his comeback plan was slow to gain momentum. Tan, who recently stepped into the role of CEO, said about two weeks ago that the chipmaker will spin off assets that aren‚Äôt central to its mission, and create new products including custom semiconductors to try to better align itself with customers. Intel needs to replace the engineering talent it‚Äôs lost, improve its balance sheet and better attune manufacturing processes to meet the needs of potential customers, Tan told attendees at a company conference. He didn‚Äôt specify which parts of Intel were no longer key to its future. A transaction for Altera comes at a time when deal activity has been crippled globally due to repercussions from US President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade tariffs. Still, private equity firms sitting on more than $700 billion in dry powder are hunting for targets that are more resilient to a trade war than manufacturers. --With assistance from Swetha Gopinath, Brody Ford, Ryan Gould and Dana Wollman.

Wiley believes that Nvidia's exposure to tariffs is quite low, while its valuation is attractive. During the same segment, Wiley praised JPMorgan (JPM) and its first-quarter results which it recently unveiled. Wiley has led companies that have been involved with financial markets since 1996, according to his LinkedIn profile. NVDA's Exposure to Tariffs Is Low, Wiley Says ""Nvidia's exposure to tariffs is less than 5%, some say less than 2%,"" Wiley stated. Moreover, in the low-$90s, the shares ""were on sale,"" he believes. Although the stock's decline naturally generates fear, such declines have historically been good buying opportunities, according to the veteran investor. ""Anytime the Vix exceeds 40, there's a 90% chance that you'll make money in the next three years,"" Wiley told Schwab.¬† And the average return during that period is 50%-80%, he added. JPM Reported Good Results, Wiley Said Asserting that JPM delivered good Q1 results ""across the board,"" Wiley noted that its revenue from equity trading jumped 48% year-over-year, while its earnings climbed significantly. Additionally, its return on tangible equity came in at 7.8%, up from ""closer to 5%"" in March 2023, he added. ""JPM looks safe and sound,"" he said. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2025-04-14 17:49:00,Here's Why Citi Downgraded US Stocks on Monday,"Citi became the latest investment firm to voice skepticism about the outlook for U.S. stocks on Monday as tariff uncertainty continues to weigh on sentiment. Citi analysts on Monday downgraded U.S. stocks to ""neutral"" from ""overweight,"" citing ""still-high valuations and mounting downgrade pressures.""¬†The analysts also upgraded Japanese and U.K. stocks to ""overweight,"" joining continental Europe in Citi's group of preferred regions. Tariffs, the analysts said, are likely to reduce both U.S. GDP and corporate earnings, undermining two of the core drivers of the ""U.S. exceptionalism"" of the past decade-plus. At the same time, Citi estimates U.S. stocks as a whole are historically expensive, ""trading at c80th percentile valuation multiple vs. history"" even after the recent sell-off. U.S. stocks have outperformed their global peers for most of the past 15 years. The post-Global Financial Crisisorder of low interest rates and low inflation favored the fast-growing tech stocks that have come to dominate the U.S. stock market. As a result of Wall Street's outperformance, international investors have bought far more U.S. stocks than the other way around. Citi warns that, against this backdrop, ""small shifts in allocation decisions can have an outsized impact."" As U.S. stocks have lost their sheen, international equities have taken on a fresh luster. European and Japanese equities, Citi says, trade at attractive valuations. Japanese equities appear to be pricing in a more substantial earnings contraction than other markets, but ""Japan seems as likely as any market to see reprieve from US tariffs,"" the analysts note. Citi also forecasts that the U.S. market is made even less attractive relative to Europe and Japan by the White House's unpredictability. ""While tariff risks have abated, macro/policy uncertainty remains elevated. ... Investors have also shown signs of shunning other US assets, with the dollar weakening and US Treasury yields rising,"" the analysts wrote.

White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won‚Äôt eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they‚Äôre included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,‚Äù U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù on Sunday.

2025-04-14 18:06:00,Trump‚Äôs Tangled Tariffs Sow Confusion as Negotiators Line Up,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff exclusions for smartphones and other tech products have added to a growing set of confusing signals for companies and trading partners digesting how to engage a White House still promising to negotiate dozens of new deals in America‚Äôs favor. Most Read from Bloomberg The Secret Formula for Faster Trains NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City‚Äôs Housing Shortage The dizzying weekend saw Trump exclude popular consumer electronics from 125% tariffs on China and a 10% baseline global tariff. The move exempted more than $101 billion in US imports from China alone and was seen as a short-term win for US tech champions like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Trump and top aides on Sunday, though, declared that the reprieve was only a procedural maneuver to ultimately hit those tech products with a different, sector-specific tariff. Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Then on Monday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he was ‚Äúlooking at something to help car companies‚Äù as they worked to set up manufacturing facilities in the US, ahead of a May 3 tariff deadline on parts. For financial markets handicapping the economic spillovers, that again made finding clarity hard in a strategy the White House insists is carefully constructed but critics see as subject to the whims of a transactional president. An early stock rally on Monday lost momentum and Treasuries extended gains as volatility persisted after seven sessions of big Wall Street swings. Most megacaps fell as the Nasdaq 100 briefly erased what had been a 2.2% jump. For countries sending delegations to Washington to negotiate ‚Äî like the European Union‚Äôs trade chief is aiming to do Monday ‚Äî fresh questions arose about whether talking is even the best approach. And for international companies operating in an environment where rules can change overnight, inactivity during the turmoil is emerging as the safest bet. ‚ÄòAct First‚Äô ‚ÄúThe Trump team continues to follow an approach of act first, then make adjustments as needed,‚Äù said Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade negotiator who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. ‚ÄúThis approach contributes to more unpredictability for investors and our trading partners, who may no longer conclude that rushing to negotiate with the US is the best approach.‚Äù Trump is hailing a flurry of negotiations aimed at locking in reduced country-by-country tariffs, which he has long said he won‚Äôt apply to sectors that have their own levies. Such duties have already been rolled out for autos, steel, and aluminum. More national security investigations that would lead to tariffs are expected in the weeks ahead on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other vital sectors. ‚ÄúWe are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,‚Äù Trump said in a social media post Sunday. ‚ÄúWhat has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.‚Äù China‚Äôs government said the US decision to exempt certain consumer electronics was a small step and called for abolishing tariffs altogether. President Xi Jinping is heading to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week to shore up relationships in the region. In Washington, the frenetic weekend shifts further muddy the water ‚Äî even if Trump‚Äôs administration had long flagged some of them. While Trump has indicated he will haggle over country rates, questions are now emerging over whether the sectoral tariffs are up for bargaining as well. ‚ÄúThose are not available for negotiation,‚Äù Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù Hours later, however, Trump signaled an openness to talks with companies over the scope of his semiconductor tariffs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be discussing it, but we‚Äôll also talk to companies,‚Äù he told reporters on the plane flying back from Florida. ‚ÄúYou have to show a certain flexibility.‚Äù Fueling Inactivity The White House‚Äôs messaging is creating more uncertainty for companies dependent on imports to the US. Detroit‚Äôs Big Three automakers for weeks have lobbied the Trump administration to exclude certain low-cost car components from planned tariffs. General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV have conceded they‚Äôre willing to pay tariffs on completed cars and large components like engines and transmissions, but company representatives have told the administration that broad parts duties would drive up costs by billions of dollars and trigger profit warnings and layoffs that would counter Trump‚Äôs goal of rebuilding US auto manufacturing. ‚ÄúThe whole system seems designed to create paralysis,‚Äù Ryan Petersen, the founder and CEO of digital freight platform Flexport Inc., wrote in a social media post Sunday. Tobias Meyer, chief executive officer of cargo and logistics giant DHL Group, said companies trying to conform with constantly shifting US directives ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know even if something‚Äôs announced, whether two days later it‚Äôs not changed again.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou really see some fatigue of decision makers in manufacturing and also in the distribution sector,‚Äù Meyer said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. ‚ÄúI hear a lot that customers simply say, ‚Äòwe‚Äôll wait for now.‚Äô‚Äù The economic fallout of such a freezing up of trade could be wide. On Monday, Singapore‚Äôs trade ministry downgraded its forecast for economic growth this year, saying businesses and consumers may ‚Äúadopt a ‚Äòwait-and-see‚Äô approach before making spending decisions.‚Äù Diplomats and other officials who‚Äôve sought to engage in talks with the US are similarly unsure about how best to proceed. Bond Market Signals In the wake of Trump‚Äôs April 2 unveiling of his new tariffs, senior administration officials publicly insisted there wouldn‚Äôt be any negotiations over his border levies. Trump‚Äôs goal of repatriating manufacturing was an inviolable priority, they said, and the purpose of the duties imposed in the name of reducing a trade deficit that Trump has declared a national emergency. The weekend pullback on tech tariffs was the second major adjustment to Trump‚Äôs duty regime in a matter of days. On April 9, the same day new duties unveiled the week before went into effect on dozens of countries, Trump abruptly reduced them all to 10% for 90 days ‚Äî except for China ‚Äî amid rapidly increasing concerns about a bond market selloff. There are also more signs that the tariffs and the growing odds of a recession that have come with them are politically unpopular. A CBS poll published Sunday found that a plurality of Americans expect Trump‚Äôs tariffs, which have raised the US‚Äôs average applied duties to their highest level in more than a century, to hurt their financial situation. The administration is now focusing on negotiations with countries including Vietnam, South Korea and Japan. The stated aim is to use the leverage Trump has built up with his tariffs to extract concessions that would open the door for more US exports or new investments in the US. While Trump has dropped tariff rates for those countries to 10% for 90 days to tee up talks, he hasn‚Äôt ruled out raising them again. How successful talks will be remains unclear, as is what exactly Trump wants or how firm he will be in holding to a 10% baseline that he and aides had set as a floor. Flying to Florida on Friday evening, Trump called the 10% ‚Äúpretty close‚Äù to a floor, but he didn‚Äôt rule out going lower. That has opened the door for countries to push for lower tariffs in their own negotiations, including with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic, who will meet his counterparts in Washington today. European officials hope his trip will provide a better sense of the US‚Äôs willingness to negotiate and what its priorities are. But in spite of repeated calls for European unity, there‚Äôs no consensus on how far the bloc should go with concessions, or how to retaliate if talks fail. Trump‚Äôs weekend exclusion did not apply to the baseline 20% tariff he applied to China over fentanyl, and that levy remains in effect. China also has signaled so far that it is not interested in any negotiations. Trump‚Äôs unpredictability still hangs over any talks, as does his commitment to the idea of tariffs as an economic tool. Diplomats involved in discussions with Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer ahead of April 2 said even those cabinet members stressed privately that any agreement would still have to be approved by Trump and that they couldn‚Äôt guarantee his response. Chip Strategy The expected so-called Section 232 national security investigations that would lead to sectoral tariffs could take months. Friday‚Äôs exemption list provides the clearest sign yet of which products could be affected. One key area is AI hardware, which the US imports primarily from Taiwan as well as Mexico, where a host of Taiwanese companies handle final assembly of products destined for the US. AI servers shipped from Mexico have so far escaped the tariffs, as much of that hardware falls under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement tariff exemption, according to Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon. If the eventual chip-sector tariffs do end up hitting servers, one guide for what‚Äôs to come may lie in Trump‚Äôs previous sectoral tariffs for autos and auto parts. Those products, subject to a 25% rate, are eligible for the USMCA exemption until the administration devises a process to impose tariffs on non US-content. But for AI servers and all other products on the exemption list that contain chips ‚Äî including consumer tech like phones and computers ‚Äî there‚Äôs still a huge open question of whether the eventual duties would apply to the entire finished goods, or just the foreign-made chips they contain. Bloomberg Tracker: Every Trump Tariff and Its Economic Effect Trump‚Äôs ultimate aim is to push more of the tech industry to rely on American supply chains. That would require a massive expansion of US chipmaking ‚Äî something that‚Äôs already underway, thanks in large part to the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Trump, however, wants to scrap the bipartisan law, and his latest tariff moves could make it more expensive for companies to complete the factories they‚Äôve announced. Based on Friday‚Äôs exemption list, the chip-sector tariffs could also hit manufacturing tools, which form the lion‚Äôs share of the price tag for new chip plants. --With assistance from Swati Pandey and Haslinda Amin.

2025-04-14 18:11:00,Tariff Twist Sends Nvidia Soaring--But Trump's Next Move Could Slam the Brakes,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) isbackin the spotlight, jumping nearly 3% at 9.30am today, as chip stocks rebounded Monday on the back of a surprise tariff exemption. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a temporary pass for semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, and related electronicsgiving the sector a moment to breathe. Nvidia surged to $110.71 in after-hours trading, following a strong Friday session. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also saw early gains, rising 4% and 1.9%, respectively, at the same time, as investors repositioned around the latest policy signals. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. But don't pop the champagne just yet. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned that this exemption is short-lived, with fresh tariffs targeting the same electronics expected in the coming months. And Trump made it loud and clear on Truth Social: semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain are next in line for national security tariff probes. This adds a thick layer of uncertainty to what was already a shaky macro backdropespecially for names like Nvidia, which sit at the heart of the AI and hardware boom. Still, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't seem rattled. At the GTC conference, he signaled that the company expects minimal disruption, thanks in part to plans to ramp up domestic production. He also downplayed recession risks, suggesting Nvidia is well-positioned regardless of where the broader economy heads. For now, investors appear to agreeleaning into Nvidia's leadership and resilience, even as clouds gather on the horizon.

2025-04-14 18:19:00,NVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) Jumps 14% In One Week After Quantum Machines Partnership,"NVIDIArecently announced a partnership with Quantum Machines to advance quantum computing research, which, alongside its acquisition of Lepton AI Inc., may have supported last week's gain of 14%. Additional collaborations, such as with Fluidstack for Exascale clusters and Kasm Technologies for AI Workspaces, highlight NVIDIA's continued expansion in AI and computing. In the broader market, technology stocks have generally trended upward, benefiting from tariff exemptions on tech products, which aligns with NVIDIA's upward price movement. While the market experienced volatility, NVIDIA's strategic actions added weight to the broader positive trend. NVIDIA has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about. AI is about to change healthcare. These 27 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early. The new partnerships and acquisitions announced by NVIDIA, including those with Quantum Machines, Toyota, and Uber, are likely to enhance NVIDIA's position in AI and quantum computing. These initiatives support the broader narrative of NVIDIA's growth in several sectors, including automotive and data centers. The company's focus on Blackwell architecture and AI scalability could drive revenue and margin improvements by positioning NVIDIA to capture a larger share of enterprise infrastructure investments. With analysts forecasting annual revenue growth of 20.4%, these collaborations may bolster projected earnings of around US$159.1 billion by April 2028, as indicated in current forecasts, although margins are expected to face some pressure. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return, combining share price appreciation and dividends, has been very large, reflecting its significant growth. In comparison to the market, NVIDIA's performance over the past year has exceeded the US Market's return of 4.8%. The share price's recent upward movement aligns with a broader industry trend and NVIDIA's own strategic actions, albeit with regulatory and operational hurdles remaining potential challenges. With the current share price at US$96.3, the recent rally still places NVIDIA at a substantial discount to the consensus analyst price target of US$169.47, suggesting room for growth if expected earnings and revenue materialize as forecasted. However, investors should consider risks such as regulatory issues and Blackwell system costs that could impact long-term profitability. As NVIDIA continues to expand its technological footprint, the alignment of these developments with future earnings forecasts will be critical in approaching the analyst price target.

2025-04-14 19:04:00,Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Growth Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,"We recently published a list of10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires. The stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride for the past few weeks as the sentiment has quickly shifted from post-election bullishness to being priced in for a slow-down or a recession. The volatility can be estimated by the 19% decrease in the S&P 500 from its recent all-time high. To talk about the current market volatility and the way forward, Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee joined CNBC for an interview. He noted that the market is currently pessimistic as recent data shows that they have priced in a 60% probability of a recession, however, it is essential to note that if the tariff situation de-escalates then the probability of a recession isn‚Äôt that high. As a result, Lee thinks that there is a big window of opportunity for stocks to rebound, however, this rebound is contingent on the path of tariff de-escalation. While addressing the concerns that if the market is in a bear market, Lee noted that if we define a bear market by stocks grinding and losing money, then this has been happening since December 2024. However, if you define a bear market as unleashing a type of financial tightening that leads to a recession, the current market does not fit that criteria. Lee acknowledged that it does feel like a bear market for an average person. Lee also talked about the viable investor strategy under the current circumstances. Firstly, he highlighted that people are fighting two brains at the moment, one is a tactical brain, where people want to know if this is the bottom and be convinced by seeing the stocks rally on bad news. On the other hand, there is the investor or the long-term brain, which suggests that people should have confidence in the US companies to navigate this volatility. Lee noted that he is a buyer of this volatility as he thinks that the de-escalation of tariffs will take place, which will result in a big rebound for stocks. To compile a list of the 10 best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires, we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Insider Monkey‚Äôs Billionaire database. Using the screener we aggregated a list of growth stocks that have grown their top-line by more than 30% over the past 3 years and sorted them by market cap. Next, we cross-checked each stock‚Äôs sales growth from Seeking Alpha and ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of billionaire investors. Please note that we have also included the hedge funds sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 3-Years Sales Growth: 69.25% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 Number of Billionaires: 29 Value of Billionaire Holdings: $33,248,032,387 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a high-growth technology company leading the AI revolution through its graphics processing units and system-on-chips units. On April 10, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore maintained their Buy rating on the stock. The analyst noted that the company is positioned well in the market despite potential challenges. He highlighted that one of the key differentiators for the company is that it generates significant revenue from a single product family which increases its influence in the industry. Moreover, Guinness Global Innovators highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as one of its top performers in its Q4 2024 investor letter. The fund highlighted that the company delivered remarkable returns of more than 177.7% during 2024, driven by its GPUs and its application within AI and data center industries. The company holds over 95% market share in advanced AI chips which positions it to capture an estimated $2 trillion AI infrastructure market in the next 5 years. It is the best growth stock to buy according to billionaires. Guinness Global Innovators stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter: ‚ÄúFor a second year running,NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund‚Äôs top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia‚Äôs ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia‚Äôs extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to ‚Äúinference‚Äù (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia‚Äôs financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia‚Äôs data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia‚Äôs technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia‚Äôs valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 1ston our list of best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Carmakers were among the first companies to enter the crosshairs of Trump‚Äôs tariff policies. Ford, GM, and Stellantis‚Äô supply chains were thrown into the spotlight in early February when Trump announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, where the car companies have a major manufacturing presence. Trump watered down those tariffs but subsequently announced a25% tariff on all cars and auto partsnot compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated in his first term.

The startup, known as SSI, was recently valued at $32 billion in a funding round led by venture capital firm Greenoaks, Reuters reported. The investment adds to the growing interest from major cloud and chip firms in backing artificial intelligence developers that require substantial computing infrastructure. Alongside the funding, Alphabet has signed SSI as an anchor customer for its in-house tensor processing units, or TPUs, according to Reuters. Darren Mowry, managing director for startup partnerships at Google Cloud, told Reuters the company is expanding external access to its proprietary AI chips. Google originally reserved TPUs for internal use but has since shifted to selling them at scale to companies developing foundational AI models. SSI is using TPUs primarily over Nvidia's widely adopted graphics processing units, which currently hold more than 80% of the AI chip market, Reuters said, citing unnamed sources. Google Cloud offers both TPUs and Nvidia GPUs to clients. The company's custom TPUs are optimized for certain AI workloads and are designed to be more efficient than general-purpose GPUs, Reuters reported. The strategy mirrors moves by other cloud providers, including Amazon (AMZN,Financials), which is developing its own chips called Trainium and Inferentia. Amazon has also invested in Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor, which continues to use Google's chips despite Amazon's backing, Reuters reported. Microsoft (MSFT,Financials), meanwhile, has invested heavily in OpenAI. Spokespeople for Alphabet, Nvidia and SSI declined to comment, according to Reuters. Reuters also reported that Nvidia has backed other AI startups, including Elon Musk's xAI, as part of its broader push into the AI ecosystem. The investment by Alphabet and Nvidia underscores the deepening ties between infrastructure providers and AI startups that are becoming major customers of their computing platforms, Reuters said.

2025-04-14 20:00:00,"Which Mag-7 Stock, Apple or NVIDIA, Should You Buy for Tariff Relief?","With new tariffs being imposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese goods at the beginning of April,Apple IncAAPL andNVIDIA CorporationNVDA saw their stocks decline. However, the latest tariff relief has been a blessing in disguise for these tech behemoths, helping them prevent higher import costs and product price rises. This has prompted speculation on which stock to invest in. Let‚Äôs explore ‚Äì President Trump‚Äôs steep tariffs on goods produced and imported from China could have disrupted Apple‚Äôs supply chains as severely as during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Apple breathed a sigh of relief after the Trump administration exempted electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs. Before the tariff exemption, Apple planned to increase iPhone production in India, which is subject to lower levies, while also securing its supply chain. Apple intends to produce over 30 million iPhones in India, satisfying a significant portion of American demand, which constitutes a third of global demand. However, Apple is manufacturing its upcoming iPhone 17 in China, which will be launched soon. Shifting the production base to India or another location in a short time will require a herculean effort. It may also lead to retaliation from China, which has set up inquiries into U.S. companies and may create difficulties for Apple through its customs processes. A complete breakup from China would be improbable as Apple produces the bulk of its iPhones in China, and there is a dearth of required skills to manufacture iPhones in the United States at the moment. Instead, Apple argued that the United States should boost semiconductor production and revive high-value job opportunities. However, the tariff relief is temporary, and if no breakthrough occurs soon, it may impact Apple‚Äôs near-term profitability. President Trump said that relying on China for vital tech goods like smartphones and semiconductors isn‚Äôt acceptable. If tariffs are imposed, iPhone prices will rise, impacting American consumers and Apple‚Äôs sales volume. Anyhow, some tariffs still apply to goods imported from China and there may be sectoral tariffs on goods that have semiconductors, which can further affect Apple‚Äôs stagnating revenues. Given the supply-chain risks, stagnant revenues and tariff uncertainties, Apple isn‚Äôt a favorable stock choice currently. Moreover, according to the price/earnings (P/E) ratio, Apple stock trades at 27.4X forward earnings. In comparison, the Computer - Micro Computers industry‚Äôs forward earnings multiple is 26.05. The Apple stock, therefore, is overvalued and may plummet if tariff issues remain unresolved. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Like Apple, NVIDIA too got a momentary relief from Trump‚Äôs tariffs. This is because certain critical chips used by NVIDIA and produced in China were exempted. Now, there is a 90-day pause in tariffs, but the outcome depends on how the negotiations between the United States and its trade partners unfold. So, an element of ambiguity persists. However, NVIDIA remains the preferred stock to buy during these times of distress. With graphic processing units (GPUs) continuing to gain popularity at a breakneck speed and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending increasing, NVIDIA‚Äôs long-term future looks brighter. Lest we forget, Apple faces tough competition across all segments, economic challenges, and regulatory hazards, affecting its long-term outlook. Coming back to NVIDIA, the company is experiencing high demand for new Blackwell and older Hopper chips because of their superior AI interfaces compared to competitors. The company‚Äôs CUDA software platform is in more demand among developers thanAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.‚Äôs AMD ROCm software platform. Major cloud computing companies likeAmazon.com, Inc.AMZN andAlphabet Inc.GOOGL¬† are also spending billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure, which could benefit NVIDIA (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy?). NVIDIA stock is currently more affordable than its competitors, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.18 compared to the Semiconductor - General industry‚Äôs 28.4X forward earnings multiple. This leads to NVIDIA having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, whereas Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2025-04-14 20:28:00,Jim Cramer Urges NVIDIA (NVDA) Holders: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be Shaken Out by Wall Street‚Äù,"We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. In his latest appearance on CNBC‚ÄôsSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer suggested the recent tariffs might not simply be about economic leverage. He hinted at a deeper agenda within parts of the administration that goes beyond trade policy: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty of sense that something‚Äôs going to happen that‚Äôs going to take this away. In fact, just because of what we saw the other day with it going to 10 percent, I don‚Äôt see that at all. I think these are very different kinds of tariffs. I mean, this is a tariff where I think there‚Äôs some people with the administration who actually ultimately have a goal of regime change.‚Äú READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key StocksandJim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key Stocks Discussing the likelihood of a negotiated settlement between Washington and Beijing, Cramer expressed deep skepticism that China would retreat under pressure. Instead, he described a Chinese leadership that had long prepared for confrontation: ‚ÄúWhen do the Chinese back down? Right now they‚Äôre not, but I don‚Äôt know. I think the Chinese have been ready for this since first Trump. I think that they are ready for tariffs. I think they‚Äôre going to build coalitions worldwide. I do not think they‚Äôre paper tigers. I think that they‚Äôre a strong country and they‚Äôre ready. They‚Äôre ready for the fight. And I‚Äôm afraid that we have many divisions that were behind enemy lines before this war started, including Apple.‚Äù To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC‚Äôs Squawk on the Street aired on April 11th. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 Cramer maintains his long-standing bullish stance on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). During the show, he contrasted short-term analyst pessimism with the company‚Äôs massive role in powering the AI revolution and urged investors not to be shaken out. Here are his comments: ‚ÄúYou have a stock like, again, the key to the market is NVIDIA, where you had a price target cut for the first time. The stock‚Äôs still up. [‚Ä¶] While revisiting the AI and semiconductor trade, Jim Cramer laid out his theory on why NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still a winner, saying: ‚ÄúOkay, here‚Äôs my theory. And so far, okayed by the powers that be. There is a shift from hyperscaler to others who need the latest and greatest. What does that mean? And by the way, Grace Blackwell sold out, which is the current chip, sold out. [‚Ä¶] And I will tell you that if you‚Äôre a robot maker, you need all the ones that you can possibly get. Self-drive, you need all these. These are not hyperscale. [‚Ä¶] I think what you find is that people who have felt that NVIDIA was an easy short, maybe not so easy.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

2025-04-14 21:17:00,"Trump Announces Chips, Drug Probes, Opening Door to Tariffs","(Bloomberg) ‚Äî President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating probes led by the Commerce Department.

The moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president‚Äôs sweeping US trade war.

The Commerce Department said it would be investigating the impact on US national security of ‚Äúimports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment‚Äù as well as ‚Äúpharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products‚Äù in a pair of notices posted to the Federal Register.

The US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.

New levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of chips essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Semiconductor supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.

The administration‚Äôs announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.

Tariffs would also be a blow to the world‚Äôs largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.

Trump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers‚Äô reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.

Trump‚Äôs move on semiconductors is similar to the way he‚Äôs targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. The president has also vowed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and possibly critical minerals.

Under Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.

Trump has cast reshoring chipmaking and revitalizing the US industrial base as essential for the nation‚Äôs security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work work.

**Worldwide Impact**

The move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (‚Ç¨47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump‚Äôs wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country‚Äôs favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship drugs to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.

The US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.

Nearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they‚Äôd be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they‚Äôd need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.

‚ÄúRe-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,‚Äù BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.‚Äù

**Trump‚Äôs Exemptions**

The US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.

The announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,‚Äù Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. ‚ÄúAnd so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‚ÄòHey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,‚Äô then he‚Äôs absolutely willing to listen. And if he‚Äôs convinced, then he‚Äôll make the call to do something like he did today.‚Äù

Trump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jzab4g/trump_announces_chips_drug_probes_opening_door_to/,4

Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, explains why Nvidia's domestic manufacturing push isn't moving the stock. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. What I can't figure out, maybe you can help us understand it, is Nvidia. Right? Now they're going to, uh, build chips and AI platforms here in the US. So certainly, uh, tariffs aren't going to be relevant for them once that's up and running in a year. And yet the stock is barely up today, maybe half a percent. Can you help us understand why Nvidia isn't up more? Yeah, I think Nvidia has a lot of other things going as well. There is this suspicion that AI has run its course, uh, things like that. You know, maybe people have already got their chips already. So things like that. Then we had Deepseek, and there's some alternatives to Nvidia. Maybe you can do things cheaper and faster in some other ways. So that that total dominance of Nvidia is being threatened, though I don't believe that. Nvidia is still the major player. Uh, you need them for everything from robotics to cars to everything else. They are the core piece of every all the things that are going on, or that are coming down the pike. So I don't think Nvidia is at risk, but on the face of it, I think there is a risk. There is that feeling that maybe it's not smooth sailing. They're going to have some, they need to do some reinvention and be ahead of the game. So there are some challenges ahead. So they had other issues going as well. Uh, and Nvidia is playing the tariff game pretty well. They're well-positioned. They're already in, uh, in Arizona, and they agree to spend $500 million, which, billion, I think that's that's great as well. So I think they're doing the right things, so I think they're okay.

We cover refinancing every business day, including thenational average refi ratefor all major loan types, as well asstate-by-state refi averages. The full article continues below these offers from our partners. The market chaos triggered by President Trump's moving-targettariffannouncements has not spared mortgage rates. Though initially a stock market sell-off prompted a drop in 10-year Treasury yields, which in turn pushed mortgage rates lower, that trend has now reversed. The 10-year Treasury yield soared last week, whichhas confounded many experts. But what's not surprising is that the surge in bond yields has pushed mortgage rates up dramatically. The latest one-week change for each new purchase loan average is shown below, followed by a deeper dive into 30-year, 15-year, and jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loans. Rates on 30-year new purchase loans shot up a remarkable 44 basis points last week, rising to a7.14% average.It's the biggest Friday-to-Friday gain for the flagship average since June 2022, and raises it to its most expensive level in almost 11 months. Things were better in September, when the 30-year average plunged to a two-year low of 5.89% (the cheapest Friday average being 6.03%). So far this year, the lowest weekly reading has been 6.55%. Every business day, we publishnational rate averages for various loan types, and alsoeach state's 30-year rate average. Right now, New York and Florida have the lowest 30-year rates. Rates on 15-year new purchase loansalso shot up last week, gaining a dramatic 54 basis points to end last week at a 6.31% average.That's now above the 2025 peak of 6.22%, and more than a full percentage point above the two-year low of 4.97% registered in September. Rates on jumbo 30-year new purchase loans climbed 44 basis points over past week, landing Friday at a 7.15% average. That's almost a quarter percentage point above the 2025 high of 6.95%. In contrast, September rates on new 30-year jumbo loans sank as far as 6.24%, with the lowest weekly average registering at 6.39%. Ajumbo mortgageis one that exceeds the maximum loan limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming loans‚Äî$806,500 for single-family homes in most parts of the U.S. in 2025, but up to $1,209,750 in certain more expensive areas. To see how much this week's rate increases would impact monthly payments for new borrowers, our tables below lay out theprincipal-plus-interest paymentfor various loan amounts with a 30-year, 15-year, or jumbo 30-year fixed-rate new purchase mortgage. By definition, jumbo 30-year mortgages are larger loans. So below we've run our calculations on loan amounts of $800,000 to $1.2 million.

2025-04-14 23:31:00,Apple and other tech stocks rebound after Trump offers more tariffs guidance,"Stock prices of Apple, Alphabet and other Silicon Valley tech companies rebounded on Monday after the Trump administration said electronics, including semiconductors and smartphones, were exempt from the ""reciprocal tariffs"" announced earlier this month. But the bounce may not last. Tech giants could still face drastic changes to how they manage their supply chain and costs. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick toldABC Newson Sunday those electronic products are going to be part of tariffs affecting the semiconductor sector ""which are coming,"" potentially in a month or two. Apple stock rose 2% to $202.52 a share on Monday, a boost from the stock's sharp decline after Trump announced reciprocal tariffs earlier this month. Google parent company Alphabet and chip maker AMD also got a reprieve, with their stock prices rising 1% on Monday. Read more:'Nowhere to hide.' How Apple and others in Silicon Valley are bracing for Trump tariffs Apple stock plummeted after Trump announced extra tariffs on China, Vietnam and India on April 2. Trump has since paused additional tariffs on most countries, but has raised duties on Chinese imports to 145%. ""We need to have these things made in America, we can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us,"" Lutnicktold ABC, adding that the goal is for the companies to bring more of their manufacturing back to the United States. The escalating conflict has worried investors because Apple and other tech companies produce many products in China. Though it has shifted more production to India in recent years, Apple still makes most of its iPhones in mainland China. Amid more pressure from the White House, Apple and Nvidia have announced plans to bring more jobs to the U.S. Nvidia on Monday said it is working with its partners to build and test Nvidia Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas, with production ramping up in the next 12 to 15 months. ""Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement. Nvidia's stock price closed at $110.71 on Monday, virtually unchanged. Apple in February said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. that would go toward various efforts, including opening a manufacturing facility in Houston. Still, analysts say it will be difficult to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and rebuilding supply chains could take years.

2025-04-15 02:00:15,South Korea‚Äôs AI Chip Champion Is Poised To Carve Out Global Niche," Fresh off a merger that created South Korea‚Äôs first AI chip unicorn, Rebellions‚Äô head Sunghyun Park is readying the next generation of its power-saving chips‚Äîpitting the young company against the industry‚Äôs giants.  This story is part of Forbes‚Äô coverage of Korea‚Äôs Richest 2025. See the full list here.  A year ago, Sunghyun Park, cofounder and CEO of Seongnam-based AI chip design firm Rebellions, got a call he was least expecting. Ryu Young-sang, head of SK Telecom, South Korea‚Äôs largest mobile operator by market share and a subsidiary of the powerful chaebol SK group, wanted to meet, recalls the 40-year-old Park, to discuss joining forces in South Korea‚Äôs vaunted semiconductor industry. But even before Ryu ‚Äútalked to me about a merger, I thought merging was the only way to survive,‚Äù Park says candidly.  Rebellions had made a name for itself with its energy-efficient AI computer chips with a range of applications, from high-frequency trading to supporting large language model tools like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. After launching the company in 2020, Park raised $225 million over five funding rounds to bankroll its Atom chip series that had become the chips of choice for South Korea‚Äôs data centers. And Rebellions‚Äô next generation of low-power-consuming chips, designed for electricity-guzzling AI hyperscalers, was on its way. But Park was well aware that he couldn‚Äôt wing it on his own to realize his global ambitions. ss Meanwhile SK Telecom‚Äîa crown jewel in the business empire controlled by Chey Tae-won (No. 36 among Korea‚Äôs 50 Richest)‚Äîhad its own AI chip startup Sapeon Korea, which was slugging it out with Rebellions in the domestic market with its X330 chip. Ryu and Park concluded that by joining forces they would not only create a national chip champion, but one with enough heft and scale to take on deep-pocketed global rivals overseas, including the industry‚Äôs undisputed leader, American tech giant Nvidia.   ‚ÄúOnly a few AI chip players can survive. In this fast-changing market, we need to consolidate all of Korea‚Äôs top talent within a single company,‚Äù says Park. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to waste time and energy to compete inside Korea,‚Äù he adds. Capturing even a sliver of the worldwide market would be a game-changer. As companies race to adopt generative AI tools trained on vast amounts of data, demand for AI chips has exploded in the past two years. Global sales are expected to top $92 billion in 2025, up 29% from $71 billion in 2024, per U.S. tech consultancy Gartner. In December, the all-stock deal was sealed, with Sapeon issuing 2.4 shares for every Rebellion share, to create South Korea‚Äôs first AI chip unicorn valued at 1.3 trillion won, the equivalent of $1 billion at the time ($900 million today). The combined entity, which retained Rebellions‚Äô management team and name, is the biggest South Korean supplier of AI chips. Its blue-chip client list includes the cloud divisions of SK and internet giants Kakao (controlled by Kim Beom-su, No. 7) and Naver (Lee Hae-jin, No. 19). ‚ÄúMerging [with Sapeon] is one of the smartest moves,‚Äù says Mohamed Zeeshan Hassan, chief investment officer of Wa‚Äôed Ventures, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco. ‚ÄúKorea is already a small market and you have to compete with global players. Why would you compete with your neighbor?‚Äù‚ÄúOnly a few AI chip players can survive.‚Äù  The new alliance gave Park, who retains a nearly 10% stake in the merged entity according to regulatory filings, access to HBM3E, an advanced high bandwidth memory chip that significantly increases data-processing speed and is made by the group‚Äôs memory chip arm SK Hynix. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a shortage in foundry [manufacturing] capacity,‚Äù says Park, ‚Äúand a shortage of HBM.‚Äù Apart from SK Hynix, the other two global suppliers of the cutting-edge chip are Samsung Electronics and Boise, Idaho-based Micron. Still, increasing sales at home, much less international growth, is a tricky proposition. Persuading data centers to source AI chips from companies other than Nvidia, the world‚Äôs dominant supplier with approximately 90% market share, according to U.K. research firm Futurum Intelligence, is almost as difficult as making the chips themselves. Nvidia (market cap: $2.8 trillion) reported $35.6 billion in data center chip sales in its fourth quarter ended January 2025, nine times that of its closest rival, California-based chipmaker AMD (market cap: $156 billion), which generated $3.9 billion in comparable revenue in the last three months of 2024. Rebellions, a minnow by comparison, is targeting 100 billion won in revenue, roughly $68 million, in 2025. According to the latest available filings, the company posted 2.7 billion won in revenue in fiscal 2023 (sales the previous year weren‚Äôt available), with a net loss that widened to 13.7 billion won from 8.1 billion won in 2022. A chip company with global ambitions has to first prove that its chip has a clear advantage over Nvidia. In early 2026 Rebellions will start mass production of its eponymously named Rebel chip, designed for energy-efficient inference‚Äîindustry lingo for when an AI model is being used‚Äîat scale. This is a big deal as a ChatGPT request through an AI server consumes ten times more electricity than a Google search, according to the International Energy Agency. Based on company performance tests, Park claims the new processor will offer three times the power savings for AI workloads compared with Nvidia‚Äôs most energy-efficient AI chip, the H100, the first in its Hopper series, launched in late 2022. Another key advantage, the CEO says, is Rebel‚Äôs 144 gigabytes of HBM3E memory capacity, a big leap over H100‚Äôs 80 gigabytes of HBM3. For example, he explains, it would require two H100s to power Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.1 large language model, compared with just one Rebel chip. A chip company with global ambitions has to first prove that its chip has a clear advantage over Nvidia. ‚ÄúIn terms of total cost of ownership [purchase price plus operating costs], Rebel is cheaper than H100 for inference,‚Äù says Park. The H100‚Äôs peak power consumption is 400W, while the Rebel chip can deliver one petaflop (1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second) of performance while using only 350W of power. However, Park concedes, ‚ÄúIf you want to do both training and inference, H100 is the right solution.‚Äù The company was unwilling to disclose how many Rebel chips it plans to produce, citing confidentiality agreements with customers. Nvidia is readying its own next-gen AI chip, the B200, for mass delivery this quarter. It says the latest offering in its Blackwell range, successor to Hopper, will have up to 30 times the inference performance and 25 times the energy efficiency of the Hopper chips plus 192GB of HBM3E. Still, this power-packed chip is expected to be more expensive to run, giving Rebellions an opportunity to position the Rebel chip as an economical alternative. Chipping In South Korea‚Äôs semiconductors exports hit a record $142 billion in 2024, making up a fifth of overall exports.Sources: South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy Recruiting top-tier talent has been a key factor in Rebellions‚Äô success, says Ki-Jun Kim, CEO of Kakao Ventures, who first met Park in 2019 and decided to invest 2 billion won in Rebellions within an hour of their conversation. Park‚Äôs stringent recruitment standards, such as hiring design engineers with experience at top semiconductor companies, helped Rebellions earn a reputation as ‚Äúthe rocket ship everyone wants to join‚Äù in South Korea, says Kim. Despite being a relatively small nation of some 50 million people, South Korea has top semiconductor talent. It‚Äôs home to two of the world‚Äôs largest memory chipmakers‚ÄîChey‚Äôs SK Hynix and Jay Y. Lee‚Äôs (No. 2) Samsung Electronics‚Äîas well as key industry suppliers, including equipment maker Kwak Dong Shin‚Äôs (No. 22) Hanmi Semiconductor and chemicals producer Chung Ji-wan‚Äôs Soulbrain. Supportive government policies have helped nurture the country‚Äôs dense tech ecosystem of conglomerates and startups, where, for example, Soulbrain‚Äôs biggest customer is Samsung while Hanmi supplies SK Hynix.In early 2026 Rebellions will start mass production of its eponymously named Rebel chip, designed to use less power to run AI models.Jae-hyun Kim for Forbes Asia Semiconductors are also the largest export category for the trade-reliant country, contributing approximately a fifth to its annual exports of $684 billion, with the U.S. market accounting for 19% of the country‚Äôs total. While semiconductors have been spared President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff axe, at least for now, they cannot escape it altogether as they are embedded in products, such as AI servers that may face additional U.S. import duties. After finishing a bachelor‚Äôs degree from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2006, Park moved to the U.S., where he studied electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. That led to jobs at Intel, Samsung Mobile and Elon Musk‚Äôs Starlink‚Äîwhere he was a chip design engineer‚Äîbefore Park landed at Morgan Stanley in New York in 2018. While developing quant models for the bank‚Äôs high-frequency trading system, he figured that orders could be executed even faster if the machines were built with customized chips. Two years later, he returned home to start Rebellions with Jinwook Oh, a KAIST alumnus and former principal designer at IBM‚Äôs research lab in New York, who became Rebellions‚Äô chief technology officer. Securing 5.5 billion won as seed funding from backers such as Kakao Ventures, they built a prototype, the Ion chip, in 2021, and from there developed their first commercial AI offering, the power-lean Atom series, launched in 2023 and touted as a cost-saving alternative for data centers. Another niche for Rebellions is offering an all-in-one solution instead of solely selling chips, says Park. ‚ÄúA lesson I learned from our customers is that they want a turnkey hardware service,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúJust plug and play.‚Äù When a hyperscaler buys AI chips, installation requires technical expertise‚Äîskills that are in short supply, Park posits. Very few chip companies go beyond selling the hardware to preserve their gross margins. In November, Rebellions partnered with Taiwanese electronics assembler Pegatron to develop AI servers powered by the Rebel chip. That was followed by a collaboration with California-based Penguin Solutions, announced in March, to help customers set up, or plug, clusters of AI chips into their server infrastructure. ‚ÄúAI chip designers don‚Äôt want to partner with others to avoid profit sharing and keep margins high,‚Äù Park says. ‚ÄúBut I love to share,‚Äù he adds, ‚Äúbecause the market is getting larger, larger and larger.‚Äù The bigger challenge is finding new customers overseas. Park struck his first deal with Saudi Aramco last August to supply its data centers with AI chips (the oil giant‚Äôs Wa‚Äôed Ventures had invested $15 million in Rebellions a month earlier‚Äîits first investment in South Korea), and by year-end had secured orders from the U.S., Japan and Thailand. An IPO as early as 2026 could also be in the cards, he says, depending on sales this year. Yoo Hoi-jun, dean of KAIST‚Äôs Graduate School of AI Semiconductor, is optimistic. Rebellions is pushing the frontier in high-speed memory and AI optimization, he says by email. Within the AI community, ‚Äúthey call it one of the most exciting names to watch in the global chip space.‚Äù MORE FROM FORBESForbesKorea‚Äôs Best-Funded AI Semiconductor Startup Aims To Take On Nvidia With Samsung-Made ChipsBy John KangForbesUnder 30 Alums‚Äô AI Startup Aims To Help Hedge Funds Speed Up Stock ResearchBy John KangForbesFormer Naver Research Scientist Launches AI Startup, Aims To Be The OpenAI Of KoreaBy John Kang Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades",News,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkang/2025/04/14/south-koreas-ai-chip-champion-is-poised-to-carve-out-global-niche/,5
2025-04-15 04:32:00,Trump Initiates Chips and Drug Probes¬†Ahead of More Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? The Secret Formula for Faster Trains Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City‚Äôs Housing Shortage President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating trade probes led by the Commerce Department. The moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president‚Äôs sweeping US trade war. The Commerce Department said it had begun investigating the impact on US national security of ‚Äúimports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment‚Äù as well as ‚Äúpharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products‚Äù in a pair of register notices. Listen to the Here‚Äôs Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. The probes, which began April 1 and were ordered under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, could play out for months. Under the law, the Commerce Secretary is expected to deliver the results of his investigation within 270 days, though Trump and other officials have signaled these efforts could conclude more quickly. The US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans. New levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of semiconductors essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties. The administration‚Äôs announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips. The Commerce Department investigation on semiconductors is designed to have a wide range, evaluating imports of both legacy and leading-edge chips that are coveted for artificial intelligence applications. The probe will span imports of all semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them as well as electronic products that contain the components, according to the government notice. Tariffs on the semiconductor sector risk affecting a wide range of companies that send billions of dollars in microprocessors and related goods to the US each year. Foreign makers of advanced chips including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix of South Korea could be forced to raise prices or accept smaller margins if Trump delivers on his threat of import levies. The measures also threaten to impose higher costs on Trump‚Äôs vision for expanding domestic semiconductor production, especially if imported chip-manufacturing equipment from companies like ASML Holding NV gets hit with tariffs. Netherlands-based ASML is a leading provider of advanced lithography machines used to produce the smallest computer chips used in AI and other sensitive applications. The separate drug probe will examine imports of all pharmaceuticals ‚Äî both finished generic and non-generic medicines ‚Äî as well as the ingredients used to make them. Investigators also will probe imports of critical pharmaceutical inputs. The public is invited to weigh in on both probes with comments over the next 21 days. Tariffs would also be a blow to the world‚Äôs largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe. Alex Schriver, spokesman for the trade group PhRMA, said in a statement that the pharmaceutical industry shares Trump‚Äôs goal of boosting US manufacturing. While he said the industry would work with the administration throughout its process, he added that ‚Äúmedicines have historically been excluded from tariffs because they can lead to higher costs and shortages of life-saving medicines.‚Äù Drug companies have raced to announce major investments in the US ahead of potential tariffs. Most recently, Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG said it plans to invest $23 billion in the US over the next five years, following earlier pledges from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson. But experts warned that likely wouldn‚Äôt blunt the impact of the tariffs. ‚ÄúThere is no quick fix for exposed companies, in our view,‚Äù Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note to clients ahead of the announcement. ‚ÄúRedomiciling manufacturing would take years and be very costly.‚Äù Drugmakers will face a choice between eating the costs of potential tariffs or raising prices for their medicines in what is already the most expensive market in the world. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot at stake politically I think for branded manufacturers to be increasing prices here,‚Äù said Marta Wosi≈Ñska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution‚Äôs Center on Health Policy. ‚ÄúI do think there‚Äôs going to be reluctance to passing through price increases.‚Äù Because there are some controls on the price of drugs, tariffs could end up hurting drugmakers‚Äô bottom line, leading them to scale back research, according to Lilly Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks. ‚ÄúWe have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade offs within our own companies,‚Äù Ricks recently told the BBC. ‚ÄúTypically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D) and I predict R&D will come first. That‚Äôs a disappointing outcome.‚Äù Trump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers‚Äô reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds. Worldwide Impact Trump‚Äôs move on semiconductors is similar to the way he‚Äôs targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. Under former President Joe Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications. Trump has cast revitalizing the US chipmaking industry and industrial base as essential for the nation‚Äôs security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work. The move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (‚Ç¨47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump‚Äôs wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country‚Äôs favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis. The US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote. Nearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they‚Äôd be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they‚Äôd need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products. ‚ÄúRe-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,‚Äù BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs Exemptions The US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US. The announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,‚Äù Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. ‚ÄúAnd so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‚ÄòHey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,‚Äô then he‚Äôs absolutely willing to listen.‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said the administration remained focused on negotiating deals that would benefit Americans. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to start the negotiations, and just like with everyone else, I‚Äôm telling them, bring your A-game. We‚Äôll see what you got, and we‚Äôll go from there,‚Äù Bessent said. Trump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place. --With assistance from Michael Shepard, Annmarie Hordern, Hadriana Lowenkron and Derek Wallbank.

2025-04-15 05:07:00,Watch These Palantir Levels as Stock Continues Recent Recovery After NATO Deal,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares jumped nearly 5% Monday to extend last week‚Äôs recovery effort followingnews that NATO had acquired the analytics software provider‚Äôs AI-enabled military system. The deal with Brussels-based NATO helps ease investor concerns that Europe may rely less on American defense contractors such as Palantir amid an uncertain trade outlook after the Trump administration earlier this month unveiledwidespread ""reciprocal"" tariffs, which have since beentemporarily paused. Palantir shares have gained 22% since the start of the year through Monday‚Äôs close but have lost around a quarter of their value since hitting theirrecord highin mid-February, amiduncertainty surrounding military spendingwith a federal push for government efficiency. Below, we take a closer look at Palantir‚Äôsweekly chartand usetechnical analysisto identify key price levels worth watching out for. Palantir shares lost as much as 47% from their record high set in February before the stock formed abullish engulfing patternlast week to signal a positive shift in investors sentiment. It‚Äôs worth pointing out that the pattern coincided with therelative strength indexrallying from the 50 threshold, a level that has proven to be a solid turning point during the stock‚Äôsuptrend. Let‚Äôs identify two key overhead areas on Palantir‚Äôs chart that investors may be watching and also point out importantsupport levelsworth monitoring during periods of weakness in the stock. Palantir shares gained 4.6% to close at $92.62 on Monday. Furtherupsidefrom current levels could see the shares make a move to around $121. This area on the chart would likely attract significant attention near the stock‚Äôsall-time high (ATH)and may be seen as a suitable location forprofit-takingopportunities. A move above the ATH intoprice discoverymode could set the stage for a longer-term rally to around $300. We projected this bullish target by applying bars pattern analysis, which takes the stock‚Äôstrendhigher from August to February and overlays it from this month‚Äôs low. Interestingly, the prior trend analyzed followed a bullish engulfing pattern, potentially providing insight as to how a new move higher from a similar chart setup may play out. Duringretracementsin the stock, it‚Äôs worth keeping an eye on the $66 level. Palantir bulls would likely look to defend this area near last week‚Äôs low and several comparable price points on the chart extending back to early November. Finally, abreakdownbelow this important technical area could see Palantir shares revisit lower support around $45. Investors may look forentry pointsin this location near the upper range of a briefconsolidationperiod that preceded last year‚Äôs post-election rally.

2025-04-15 08:51:00,Nvidia Has 3 Considerably Bigger Concerns Than Tariffs,"""Buckle up and hold on"" has been something of a theme for Wall Street over the last two weeks. Ever sincePresident Donald Trump unveiled his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, theDow Jones Industrial Average,S&P 500, andNasdaq Compositehave logged some of their largest single-session point gains and declines since their respective inceptions. Whereas the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks were responsible for leading the broader market higher for more than two years, these highly influential businesses have taken it on the chin during the recent sell-off. For instance, Wall Street'sartificial intelligence (AI)darlingNvidia(NVDA-0.18%)briefly became the world's largest public company and sported a market cap of nearly $4 trillion during the first week of January. But since reaching its closing high on Jan. 6, it's shed 26% of its value (as of April 11), and plunged by as much as 36% (as of April 8). Image source: Getty Images. Some investors might quick to assign the blame for this weakness on uncertainty tied to President Trump's tariff announcement. Although Trump has issued a 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs for most countries, a series of escalating tariffs between the U.S. and China could be problematic. Even though Nvidia doesn't import from China, the world's No. 2 economy is one of Nvidia's core markets by net sales. Retaliation from China could take the form of shunning Nvidia's AI hardware. Initially, Trump's Liberation Day announcement alsocalled for a higher tariff on Taiwan, which is home to world-leading chip fabricatorTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.90%). TSMC, as Taiwan Semi is more commonly known, is akey provider of chip-on-wafer-on-substrate packaging technologythat incorporates the high-bandwidth memory needed to make AI-accelerated data centers tick. Thankfully, an update this past weekend from the president ensured that chips and chip equipment would be excluded from reciprocal tariffs. Tariffs, and the uncertainty created by President Trump changing when and what tariffs go into effect, are a problem for Nvidia. However, tariffs are pretty far down the list of things current and prospective Nvidia shareholders should be worried about. Three other factors are far more likely to be responsible for weighing down Nvidia stock. Competition is pretty much a universal problem for publicly traded companies. Even though Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) and successor Blackwell GPU architecture currently account for the lion's share of GPU market share in high-compute data centers, they're not impervious to growing competition. Most investors are probably focused on external direct competitors, such asAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.19%).AMD continues to develop new generations of its Instinct series AI-accelerating chips, all of which have been notably less-costly than Nvidia's AI hardware. Businesses that are unwilling to wait in a long queue for access to Nvidia's AI chips might opt for AMD's Instinct GPUs. But there's a bigger threat for Nvidia than AMD and its peers --a threat that emerges from within. Many of the largest GPU orders received by Nvidia have come from members of the Magnificent Seven. The problem is that these industry goliaths are also internally developing AI chips and/or solutions of their own to use in their data centers. Even though this internally developed hardware is unlikely to be superior to Nvidia's in terms of computing speed, it's considerably cheaper and more readily available (i.e., not backlogged). Put another way, Nvidia can continue to introduce new AI-GPUs annually and still lose valuable data center real estate to its own top customers. That's bad news for future orders and Nvidia's already retracing gross margin. Image source: Getty Images. A second issue that's more of a worry than tariffs is the possibility of history rhyming, once more, on Wall Street. For the better part of the last three decades, investors have had a next-big-thing technology or innovation to hold their attention. It's not uncommon for investors to be drawn in by pie-in-the-sky addressable market figures attached to a potentially game-changing technology or trend. However, every next-big-thing trend since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s has endured the same fate:a bubble-bursting event. Professional and everyday investors consistently overestimate how quickly a new trend or technology will earn widespread adoption and/or gain meaningful utility, which is what leads to lofty expectations not being met. Though we've witnessed aggressive enterprise spending on AI infrastructure, there's little evidence to suggest that businesses are generating a positive return on these AI investments or have figured out how to optimize their AI solutions. It takes time for all new technologies and trends to mature, and it's safe to say that artificial intelligence isn't anywhere close to this point as of yet. If history were to rhyme and investor expectations are reset,there's arguably not a public company that would be hit harder than Nvidia.  NVDA PS Ratiodata byYCharts. PS Ratio = Price-to-sales ratio. The third issue that's a considerably bigger concern than tariffs for Nvidia is its valuation. Last summer, Nvidia'sprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiopeaked at 42.39, which is consistent with the peak P/S ratios of market-leading businesses prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. Even though Nvidia's P/S ratio has been halved since last summer to 21.06, this is still double the premium assigned to the priciest Mag-7 stocks, relative to their sales. As alluded earlier, Nvidia's generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) gross margin has begun rolling over, as well. Exceptional pricing power for its GPUs, along with AI-GPU scarcity, helped lift its GAAP gross margin to a peak of 78.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 (ended April 28, 2024). However, its GAAP gross margin has fallen in each successive quarter andis forecast to dip to 70.6%(+/- 50 basis points) in the fiscal first quarter of the current year. Waning AI-GPU scarcity and the company's own accelerated product replacement cycle could be an ongoing drag on margins. Nvidia's efforts to bring a new AI-GPU to market annually could lead to rapid depreciation of prior-generation AI-GPUs, as well as lessen the desire by existing customers to upgrade to next-gen hardware. While the very long-term outlook for artificial intelligence solutions and Nvidia remains bright,Nvidia stock could easily underwhelm in the coming quarters, regardless of what happens on the tariff front.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/15/nvidia-3-considerably-bigger-concerns-than-tariffs/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=e34317bd-404f-4f9f-87da-823db6e2c559&.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-15 09:32:00,Think Nvidia Is Still Expensive? This Chart Might Change Your Mind.,"The recent market turmoil can make any investor nervous. Volatility can be scary as you see the value of your portfolio slump along with the market. For those who remain calm and stay focused on the underlying businesses, it can mean opportunity. Some stocks have risen to nosebleed levels over the past two years in the bull market.Nvidia(NVDA-0.18%)has been a favorite name, but many investors may have felt they missed the boat as the stock soared. Even with the recent market correction, shares have risen over 400% in the last three years. While some may still view the artificial intelligence (AI) leader as expensive, there is good evidence that now is a great time to buy Nvidia stock. Regardless of whether a trade war accelerates or if tariffs raise prices and slow economic growth, Nvidia's business has some built-in insulation. Its AIGPU chips, software stacks, and related architecture are in high demand and should be for a long time to come. The company is also very well positioned for theadvancement of roboticsand driver assistance technology. Now investors can get on board the Nvidia train at a valuation it hasn't hit in more than a year. Fear in the market has driven the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to below 25 based on this year's earnings estimate.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts If shares remain stagnant, that valuation will become even more compelling as sales continue to grow. But waiting could cause investors to be left behind.

2025-04-15 10:15:00,"Nasdaq Bear Market: 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Down More Than 20% You'll Wish You'd Bought on the Dip","TheNasdaq-100index is home to 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on theNasdaqstock exchange, including each of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, which have a combined value of $14.7 trillion: Their size is just one of the reasons Wall Street named these stocks the Magnificent Seven in 2023. Each of the seven stocks has a tendency to outperform the broader market over the long term, and the underlying companies are solidified leaders in their respective industries. On April 2, President Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on all physical products imported into America, which sent investors flocking to safe-haven assets like cash on fears of a global economic slowdown. As a result, the Nasdaq-100 is in the throes of a bear market after plunging by as much as 23% from its February record high. But that might be a big opportunity for investors. Shares of Nvidia and Alphabet are down by more than 20% from their all-time highs, yet most of the products they sell are either exempt from President Trump's tariffs or were never impacted to begin with. Here's why it might be a great idea for investors to buy the dip, with the intention of holding Nvidia and Alphabet for the long run. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia sells the world's most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which have set the benchmark when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) development. It all started with the H100 GPU, which helped the company win 98% of the market in 2023, as it was the best chip for traininglarge language models(LLMs) and performingAI inference. These models generated ""one-shot"" responses to user inputs, which was useful at the time, but they often made mistakes. Rather than feeding LLMs an endless amount of training data, developers are now building ""reasoning"" models that spend more time thinking before generating a response. In other words, they make better use of the data they already have and weed out inaccuracies in the background before rendering a response for the user. Some of the best reasoning models available today includeOpenAI'sGPT-4o series, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek's R1, and Alphabet's Gemini 2.5. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, these models require a staggering100 times more computing powerthan traditional LLMs. He says each response they generate consumes 10 times more tokens (words and symbols) because of how much time they spend thinking. Plus, that makes them much slower to render responses, so GPUs need to be 10 times faster to offset the delays -- otherwise, users might grow tired of the whole experience. As a result, Nvidia's Hopper architecture (which is at the foundation of the H100 GPU) is no longer sufficient. Instead, developers are transitioning to Nvidia's Blackwell-based GPUs like the GB200, which can perform AI inference at 30 times the speed of the H100. The company also revealed an upgraded architecture called Blackwell Ultra during the GTC 2025 conference in March, which delivers up to 50 times more performance than Hopper. Nvidia's data center business generated a record $115.2 billion in total revenue during its fiscal year 2025 (ended Jan. 26), which was a whopping 114% increase from the prior year. But Huang believesAIdata center infrastructure spending will top $1 trillion annually by 2028 as reasoning models grow more power-hungry, so Nvidia's opportunity is set to grow significantly from here. Investors can buy Nvidia stock at a very attractive valuation right now. It trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 37.7 as of this writing, which is a 36% discount to its 10-year average of 59.6:  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts Semiconductors are exempt fromPresident Trump's tariffson Taiwan, which is where many of Nvidia's chips are fabricated. However, the company does face uncertainty because it relies on hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center spending from just a handful of customers to fuel its growth, so if trade tensions dent the global economy, some of those buyers could revise their capex plans. However, this is likely to be a short-term headwind because countries are already negotiating trade deals with the Trump administration. Therefore, investors who buy Nvidia stock at the current price could still do extremely well over a time frame of three to five years. Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet is the tech conglomerate behindGoogle, YouTube, self-driving car developer Waymo, and more. Since Google has been the window to the internet for over two decades, Alphabet has a bigger stockpile of valuable data with which to develop powerful AI models than almost any other company, and it's putting it to good use. Alphabet launched theGemini2.5 Pro reasoning model earlier this month, and the company says it outperforms the latest models from OpenAI,Anthropic, DeepSeek, and evenElon Musk'sxAI across several benchmarks. It powers a stand-alone chatbot called Gemini, but it will also help Alphabet further improve the new AI features in Google Search -- and this is critical because the advertising dollars brought in by the search engine still account for over half of the conglomerate's total revenue. Alphabet introduced AI Overviews for Google Search last year, which combines text, images, and links to third-party websites to produce AI-generated responses to almost any query. Overviews appear at the top of the traditional search results, so they can save users from sifting through web pages to find the information they need. So far, Alphabet says Overviews monetize just as well as the traditional search format, so it appears they won't disrupt the company's golden goose. Alphabet doesn't just develop AI for its own purposes -- it also sells a range of services to help businesses and developers achieve their goals in this space via the GoogleCloud platform. It offers access to powerful data center infrastructure and ready-made models like Gemini to help developers accelerate their AI software projects. In the final quarter of 2024, Google Cloud customers were using eight times more computing capacity than they were 18 months earlier, which highlights how quickly AI adoption is scaling. Alphabet is currently the cheapest stock in theMagnificent Seven. Based on the company's $8.04 inearnings per sharelast year, its stock trades at a P/E ratio of just 19.5:  TSLA PE Ratiodata byYCharts The rest of the Magnificent Seven stocks trade at an average P/E ratio of 31.3 (excludingTesla because its sky-high valuation is an outlier), so Alphabet stock would have to soar by 60% just to catch up. Alphabet's advertising revenue could take a hit if global trade tensions spark an economic slowdown because businesses would probably trim their marketing budgets. But aside from that indirect consequence, the company primarily sells digital products and services that are excluded fromtariffsat the moment. Setting trade tensions aside, Alphabet's leadership position in the AI race could make it a fantastic addition to any portfolio over the long term, especially at the current price.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/15/nasdaq-bear-market-2-magnificent-seven-stocks-dip/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=506642e2-ef5c-4b3c-aaea-2f1140f48378&.tsrc=rss,3

TheVanguard Information Technology ETF(VGT0.72%)exclusively invests in stocks from the information technology sector (including those inside and outside the S&P 500), and it has outperformed the S&P 500 every year, on average since it was established in 2004. Therefore, investors with a spare $550 might want to take the opportunity to buy one share in this fund while it's trading at a discount during the tech bear market. Image source: Getty Images. On April 2, President Trump announced plans to impose a sweeping 10%tariffon all physical products imported into America, in addition to a series of much higher ""reciprocal"" tariffs on goods from specific countries. The reciprocal tariffs have since been paused for 90 days pending negotiations between the U.S. and its trading partners, except for those placed on China, which remain active. Sweeping tariffs have immediately increased the cost of living for consumers, which could dent America's economic growth. Plus, some countries have imposed their own tariffs in retaliation, which will also hurt U.S. exporters. This is a cocktail for weaker corporate earnings, which is whythe S&P 500 suffered such a sharp declineover the last few weeks. However, many of the products and services produced by companies in the information technology sector aren't directly affected by the tariffs, which is why I believe the sector's underperformance relative to theS&P 500represents a big opportunity for investors. For example, semiconductors have been excluded from President Trump's tariffs from the beginning, which means the industry-leadingartificial intelligence(AI) chips produced by companies like Nvidia andBroadcomwon't be affected. Moreover,Microsoftprimarily sells digital products like the Windows operating system and 365 productivity suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), in addition tocloud servicesthrough its Azure platform. None of those are subject to the tariffs (for now). Further, last weekend, President Trump announced that smartphones and computers will be removed from the reciprocal tariffs that are still in place on imports from China. This significantly benefits Apple, which manufactures around 90% of its iPhones in that country. Below is a list of other holdings in the Vanguard Information TechnologyETFthat primarily sell software, cloud services, digital products, or exempted products like semiconductors: Stock Vanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting Salesforce 1.78% Oracle 1.72% Accenture 1.38% Adobe 1.22% Palantir Technologies 1.13% Qualcomm 1.12% Advanced Micro Devices 1.02% Palo Alto Networks 0.81% Micron Technology 0.68% CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) 0.63% Data source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Feb. 28, 2025, and are subject to change. The Vanguard ETF holds 314 different stocks. However, the above 10 stocks, combined with Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, account for a whopping 61.7% of the entire value of its portfolio. With all of that said, even though the above companies aren't directly impacted by tariffs, they are likely to suffer indirect consequences from President Trump's trade policies. If the U.S. economy does slow down, they will experience weaker demand for their products and services. This effect could be especially pronounced for the likes of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, which are relying on hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure spending from just a handful of customers each year to fuel their growth. Some of that potential risk is already priced in.Nvidia stock, for instance, is down by 25% from its record high, wiping a staggering $900 billion off the company'smarket capitalization. That reduces the potential downside risk for investors who swoop in and buy the Vanguard ETF today. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF was recently down by as much as 27% from its record high, so it's heavily underperforming the S&P 500 at the moment. However, the picture looks very different when we zoom out and examine its long-term performance. The Vanguard ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 12.8% since it was established in 2004, comfortably beating the average annual gain of 9.6% in the S&P 500 over the same period. That 3.2 percentage point difference doesn't sound like much at face value, but it would have made a world of difference in dollar terms thanks to the magic of compounding: Starting Balance In 2004 Compound Annual Return Balance In 2025 $50,000 12.8% $627,279 $50,000 9.6% $342,761 Calculations by author. In my view, even if the economy slows due toglobal trade tensions, investors are likely to continue buying quality stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. These companies have incredibly strong balance sheets with plenty of cash on hand, in addition to reliable earnings and leadership positions in their respective industries. They could still be the best houses in a bad neighborhood, so to speak, as the rest of the market faces the same economic challenges. Plus, PwC predicts the AI revolution will add a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and much of that value will be created by the companies in the information technology sector. As a result, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF might be a great buy during the tech bear market.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/15/1-spectacular-vanguard-etf-to-buy-with-550-during/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=592446b5-2269-4467-806d-4c6c5baffb6f&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-15 10:57:00,Intel: Overblown Optimism Meets Stark Reality,"Intel is staring down multiple challenges that could fundamentally change the company as we know it. To say I'm surprised by its stock recovery would be an understatementsince early February, Intel has outperformed its semiconductor peers by a wide margin. The return of Lip-Bu Tan as CEO, after his abrupt resignation in August 2024 over issues like a bloated workforce, a cautious approach to innovation, and an underperforming AI strategy compared to NVIDIA's clear dominance, has certainly stirred things up. Tan's comeback has reignited investor enthusiasm, even though I'm still cautious about whether his leadership will deliver sustained gains. After all, he wasn't entirely unhappy with how Gelsinger was running things, particularly regarding the manufacturing strategy. That said, I must give credit to Tan's stellar track record as CEO at Cadence, where his leadership drove a surge in value exceeding 3,000%. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC. INTCData byGuruFocus However, investors should keep in mind that turnarounds take time, no matter how much was done by previous leadership. While Tan is undoubtedly a respected veteran with deep relationships across the semiconductor value chain, I believe that the initial euphoria is already priced into the stock and that the market will become more cautious moving forward. In this article, I'll outline my doubts and explain why, at this moment, I'm not fully buying into the hype around Intel. Intel is staring down multiple challenges that could fundamentally change the chip company as we know it today. The recovery in Intel's stock has been surprisingsince early February, Intel has outperformed its semiconductor peers by a significant margin. The return of Lip-Bu Tan as the new CEO on March 18, 2025, has rekindled his relationship with the board following his abrupt resignation in August 2024, when he was reportedly dissatisfied with Intel's bloated workforce, overly cautious approach to innovation, and an underperforming AI strategy compared to NVIDIA's clear dominance. Although Tan's comeback has sparked renewed optimism and pushed the stock higher by over 10%, I remain skeptical about whether his leadership will generate sustained gains, especially since he wasn't entirely unhappy with how Gelsinger was steering the company away from his key manufacturing strategy. However, I must give due credit to Tan's proven track record as Cadence CEO, during which the company's value surged by more than 3,000%. Investors should remember that turnaround efforts take time, regardless of past achievements, and while Tan is a highly respected veteran with deep industry relationships, I believe the initial euphoria has already been priced into the stock. Tan's return to the board also means that he isn't entirely opposed to the manufacturing strategy that Gelsinger implementedto reshape Intel's semiconductor fabrication into a foundry service for external customers. This plan, however, should raise a red flag for Intel investors. Manufacturing chips is an enormous expense that Intel currently struggles to sustain, a view shared by many industry leaders and analysts. Despite early-stage discussions with competitors like Broadcom, Qualcomm, GlobalFoundries, and TSMC, a deal to sell all or part of Intel's business appears unlikely in the near term. In my opinion, a more realistic outcome might be a joint venture, perhaps with TSMC, which has recently floated the idea of a potential partnership regarding Intel's chip-making business. Such a joint venture could help reorganize Intel's struggling foundry segment, which has incurred massive losses. For context, Intel's foundry lost $8.1 billion in 2024 on a gross margin basisbefore considering $5.4 billion in operating expenditurescompared to a loss of $2.6 billion the previous year. Alternatively, a spin-off might be on the table, with Intel retaining a majority stake, but if a joint venture does not materialize, Intel may face even tougher competition, especially as TSMC looks to invest more aggressively in U.S. production, fueled in part by policy initiatives like the CHIPS Act now under intense government scrutiny. Intel's disappointing execution in the data center chip market, coupled with its failure to develop competitive GPUs, has led to a significant contraction in operating cash flow over the past couple of years. Since 2020, Intel's operating cash flow has dropped by 77%, and the company has experienced three consecutive years of negative adjusted free cash flow. The enormous losses in the foundry business further compound these issues, making it increasingly difficult for Intel to steer its overall business toward profitability. The new CEO, Tan, has an opportunity to turn the struggling chip maker around, but he will need to act decisively to cut losses and reduce cash burnpossibly by slashing the bloated employee base once again. Intel recently announced a massive restructuring in August, cutting roughly 15% of its 125,000 employees, though these disruptive cuts might not help attract top talent. INTCData byGuruFocus The decline in top-line revenue forecastsfrom over $60 billion in early 2024 to below $54 billion nowreflects these ongoing challenges, as Intel lags behind competitors like NVIDIA and AMD, and even loses market share in the CPU, GPU, and data center markets. For instance, Intel's x86 CPU market share fell to 75-80% in 2024 from 82% in 2023, while AMD and Apple's in-house chips have further eroded Intel's presence. In the GPU space, Intel is far behind NVIDIA's ~88% market share, and alternatives like ARM chips, AWS Graviton, and Google TPUs are gaining traction. From a margin perspective, Intel's performance has been disappointing. Historically, Intel's gross margins ranged between 55-60%, but this year they have fallen sharply to 33.8%. The new CEO has hinted at further restructuring to address a bloated headcount of 105K, a number that far exceeds the approximately 30K employees at competitors like NVIDIA and AMD. Although Intel's chip design business does not encompass the entire employee base, the overall high headcount is unsustainable. With declining revenue expectations and mounting pressure to reduce costs, Intel's management likely faces another 18+ months of restructuring before the turnaround can be considered effective. The new CEO must quickly address the foundry challenges, possibly by divesting or restructuring that segment, and resolve the AI GPU issues before the stock can become attractive. While there is some hope that improved operations, along with $8 billion to $11 billion in partner contributions and government incentives, could lead to positive adjusted free cash flow this year, any further delay in revenue and earnings recovery could result in another cycle of cash burn. Because Intel is expected to report almost no profit this yeareven on a non-GAAP basisits valuation looks very high. INTC's forward earnings multiple of almost 50x (significantly above the likes of NVIDIA, AMD, and TSMC) suggests that the market has factored in a lot of optimism on Tan's return, while the details on how he plans to turn the chipmaker around remain unclear. To me, this indicates that the market is overly optimistic on earnings recovery expectations. We need to look at a three-year forward multiple to see things more reasonably, where Intel is at 13.4x, roughly the same as AMD, while NVIDIA is at 16.2x, and other players like Broadcom at 18.3x, Qualcomm at 12.6x, and TSMC at 10x. [Alpha Spread] I expect Intel's multiple will get further compressed as the company continues to struggle with its foundry business and delays in launching its AI GPU product until at least next year. My thesis is that the stock will likely get worse before it gets better, because the new CEO isn't a miracle worker. For example, comparing to AMD, AMD is now cheaper than Intel, and AMD does not have to deal with the financial struggle of reorganizing its business. Advanced Micro Devices is selling at a leading profit multiple of 13.8x, which reflects a slight discount to Intel's present earnings multiple of 13.4x. In my view, AMD is a rock-solid chip play that has become too cheap recentlyan alternative way to allocate capital instead of investing in Intel, especially without any clarity on its foundry business. At the moment, Intel is expected to show the least revenue growth among peers like NVIDIA, AMD, and TSMC, and that isn't forecast to change anytime soon. Therefore, I find it hard to rationalize diverting capital to Intel over the other names. Additionally, if earnings estimates continue to be cut, the valuation will be pushed up exponentiallyas seen for 2025, a move closer to a flat line for non-GAAP EPS could put the P/E on expected earnings into the hundreds. [Alpha Spread] Looking at a DCF valuation, any upside momentum for Intel looks even bleaker. Based on Wall Street estimates, my DCF model suggests an intrinsic value of $21.74 per share, which represents a potential downside of about 5%. This model uses a rather optimistic discount rate of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 3%. Revenue projections in the DCF model forecast growth from $55 billion in Year 1 to $68 billion by Year 5, which is in line with Wall Street estimates. Additionally, net margins are expected to expand significantly, rising from 4% in Year 1 to 12% by the end of the forecast period. Even with these optimistic assumptions, the DCF model indicates an apparent downside for Intel. Honestly, I think Intel's recent run-up has already priced in most of the optimism around Tan's return. Yeah, the stock had been stuck below its average price target for most of the past year, but last week's rally changed that. As of March 28, Intel was sitting around its average valuation of $22.9. But let's not forgetjust a year ago, the average price target was in the mid-$40s, and three years ago, it was in the mid-$50s. That tells me analysts have been cutting their expectations for a while now. The broader semiconductor and tech sell-off has actually made valuations look more attractive across the boardMorningstar even says the tech sector is about 8% undervalued right now. So, with better opportunities popping up elsewhere, I think it makes sense to start reallocating away from Intel. The excitement around Tan is already baked into the price, and I don't see a strong enough reason to keep riding this wave. Big-name investors have been dumping Intel for a while now. Since mid-2022, guru sells have been outpacing buys, and some of the biggest names in the gameKen Fisher(Trades,Portfolio),Mario Gabelli(Trades,Portfolio), andChris Davis(Trades,Portfolio)have been cutting their stakes significantly. Fisher, for example, slashed his Intel holdings by about 77% as of late 2024 and shifted that capital into AMD, Nvidia, and Broadcomcompanies that, let's be honest, have a much clearer path in AI. That tells me that even the investors who once backed Intel as an AI play are jumping ship. Chris Davis(Trades,Portfolio) did the same thing, cutting his Intel position by almost 80%. But instead of going all-in on AI, he moved into Applied Materials (which has a much stronger outlook, in my opinion) and more traditional plays like CVS and REITsthink Hudson Pacific Properties and Rexford Industrial Realty. The way I see it, these guys aren't just rotating out of Intelthey're moving toward companies with better long-term potential and fewer question marks hanging over them. And honestly? That makes a lot of sense to me. In conclusion, I believe Intel is in a complete mess right now. The company is losing on multiple fronts and is clearly being crushed by its competitionsomething I really dislike when assessing an investment. While there is always the possibility of a 180 turnaround, I see absolutely no signs of that happening in the near term. Now that Intel has named a new CEO, I expect the company to finally get its act together, but investors need to see a concrete plan to turnaround this struggling business. Although Intel shares have held up somewhat amid overall market turbulence, true gains won't materialize until its financials improve meaningfully. Even though I appreciate Tan's background, I remain wary that a new CEO can immediately fix decades of strategic drift. Until Intel shows real, tangible improvements and carves out a competitive niche, I believe its risk/reward profile stays tilted to the downside.

That's one early takeaway from the tariff drama. Investors momentarilypoured back into Big Techafter the administration initiateda temporary levy exemptionthat covers consumer electronics, networking equipment, GPUs, and servers. It's essentially another way of saying that Big Tech will probably be OK, as investors alsolook to the sector as a defensive play. Meanwhile, other sectors and companies still stare down amassive tariff upheaval. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy It's a feature of American politics to want to avoid the appearance of picking winners and losers in the market. That phrase is often used as a rhetorical cudgel to attack opponents as bad for the economy. But one person's favoritism is another's industrial policy. If the market is consumed by the repercussions of tariffs, exemptions to those taxes can mean everything.The potential special carve-outs for tech, however, initially sparked a rally on Monday, fizzled, then rebounded. Part of this confused response from investors was the White Houseseemingly sending mixed signals. After the exclusions from reciprocal tariffs were first unveiled, the president said in a social media post ""there was no Tariff 'exception' announced."" He later told reporters that his goal was encouraging production to move to the US but added that the administration has to show flexibility. The tech titans hoping to receive assistance from the White House are showing flexibility too, or rathera willingness to support the president's agendaof bolstering domestic manufacturing and investment. Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday said it willproduce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructurein the US within the next four years. That announcement follows other Big Tech commitments from Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) to spend in the US. Recent trading sessions with wild upward swings have made one thing clear: Pronouncements on tariffs arethe only meaningful catalyst for stocksin this uncertain moment. That goes for Big Tech too, whose trillion-dollar tickers are buoyed by global supply chains and customer bases all around the world. It's true that their size and market heft might allow these companies to weather whatever tariff costs come. But people are intimately familiar with how much, say, a phone costs, making a sudden upcharge on a finished product an unsavory consumer experience. It is, perhaps, the modern price of bread. Overall, the dizzying tariff news, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients, is ""a step forward net positive for Apple as well as other tech names."" It creates the space for some sort of negotiation with China, he said, and can lead to a deescalation of the trade war issues that have left Big Tech caught in the middle. Their importance for American tech supremacy means, in a way, they are too important to fail, and the value they bring to the stock market makes the rest of the S&P seem like lesser moons in a solar system that revolves around them. But in this chaotic environment, the most important distinction of all isn't size alone; it's a tariff carve-out. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

2025-04-15 11:30:00,"Got $1,000? Here Are 2 Fantastic Stocks to Buy Right Now.","If you've got some undeployed cash that you're looking to invest in the stock market, I've got two fantastic stocks that look like excellent buys. However, there is a disclaimer on these stocks: you'll need to hold them for at least three to five years to get the full benefit. The tailwinds in the industries that these two operate in are long-term trends. However, the stocks will be disrupted occasionally due to fears of how the economy is doing, President Donald Trump's tariff plans, or some other unknown issue that has yet to be uncovered. If you can keep that mindset, then I think thatNvidia(NVDA-0.18%)andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.90%)are top buys right now. If you've got $1,000 to invest, I can think of few better stock picks, and I believe that over that three- to five-year time frame, it's not unreasonable to expect your money to double. Both Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are at the center of a major technological shift: artificial intelligence (AI). AI has the power to transform how we do business and tasks in our daily lives and is likely the biggest innovation since the internet became widespread. This makes this trend a must-invest area, and focusing on suppliers is a great way to make a solid profit. TSMC and Nvidia make key components in the AI value stream and are making lots of money from the trend right now.Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs)are the computing muscle behind many of the AI models that are used today. These devices can process multiple calculations in parallel, making them more suited for arduous computing tasks like AI. Additionally, GPUs can be combined in clusters to further amplify that effect, which is why you'll hear about AI hyperscalers placing over 100,000 GPUs in a data center. Nvidia may design and combine components to produce a GPU, but it doesn't make the chips that go into them; that's where Taiwan Semiconductor shines. TSMC is a chip fabricator and takes designs from clients like Nvidia orAppleand produces them on their behalf. This is a great position because TSMC can sell to companies competing against each other, as it does with Nvidia andAdvanced Micro Devices. Although most of its chips are produced in Taiwan, which was a target of Trump's tariffs, it is working on expanding production in the U.S. However, semiconductors are specifically exempt from tariffs, so this isn't a concern right now -- but it could be at some point. Taiwan Semi recently announced a $100 billion investment in U.S. production facilities, which will include three fabrication facilities, two packaging facilities, and one research and development center. This announcement put TSMC in Trump's good graces, as the company is doing exactly what he wants: moving production capabilities within U.S. borders. The investment case for these two is strong, but what kind of growth can investors expect? Management teams for Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor have openly discussed their growth trajectories. Right now, Nvidia estimates that data center capital expenditures reached around $400 billion. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expects that figure to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia generated around $130 billion in revenue. So, if Nvidia could maintain its current revenue share of the build-out expenses (around 33%) and the projection comes true, Nvidia's revenue could double by 150% from now to 2028, when it would be producing $325 billion. Even if its market share slips to a quarter of total buildout spend, Nvidia's revenue would still nearly double in four years, which would be excellent news for shareholders. Taiwan Semiconductor's management sees a similar growth trajectory. Over the next five years, it expects AI-related revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45%. This boosts its overall growth rate, which management believes will be near 20%. If TSMC can grow its revenue at a CAGR of 20% over the next five years, that would mean its revenue would rise around 150% in the next five years. That's huge growth for both of these companies, and with each off their all-time highs by around 30%,now is an excellent time to scoop these two up.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/15/got-1000-here-are-2-fantastic-stocks-to-buy-right/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=61875d7d-d0a8-4e30-b0f4-736af72e9510&.tsrc=rss,4

TECH + INNOVATION ‚Äã‚Äã Shares of Apple jumped Monday as the world‚Äôs largest company received a bump from the White House‚Äôs tariff exemptions on smartphone imports. The tech giant‚Äôs stock price finished the day at about $202, roughly a 17% jump from its $172 close a week ago‚Äîits lowest level since last May. The tariff exemption also signaled good news for prospective iPhone buyers, as prices are less likely to see an immediate hike. MONEY + POLITICS  In an Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Monday, White House advisor Stephen Miller said that bringing a Maryland father who was mistakenly deported back to the U.S. would amount to ‚Äúkidnapping,‚Äù because he is now in the custody of El Salvador. The Trump Administration admitted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported due to a ‚Äúclerical error,‚Äù but has refused to comply with a district court order to ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù his return, which was partially upheld by the Supreme Court last week. SPORTS + ENTERTAINMENT Amid a recent wave of private equity firms purchasing stakes in professional sports teams, New York-based Velocity Capital Management will go a different route and announce today that it has agreed to make a strategic investment in Unique Sports Group, a soccer talent agency headquartered in London that represents more than 350 soccer players. The agency will use the capital to fuel its growth strategy and open new lines of business, such as entering women‚Äôs sports. SCIENCE + HEALTHCAREgetty Residential solar developers already tend to have complicated financial statements, but a recently revealed hidden spreadsheet from troubled firm Sunnova Energy suggests the company was manipulating its public disclosures, according to short sellers. As vultures circle Sunnova, allegations that it had been overstating its solar system statistics ‚Äúto fabricate larger amounts of federal investment tax credits‚Äù aren‚Äôt likely to help. DAILY COVER STORY Meet The Forbes Under 30 Europe Class Of 2025adepoju sebastian nevols for forbes The honorees on the 2025 Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe list are building virtual worlds, revolutionizing fertility, reinventing retail and dominating the entertainment game‚Äîall while navigating a global trade war, a live war in Ukraine and the whiplash that comes with the constant evolution of generative AI. A number of listmakers are harnessing AI‚Äôs power to tackle important problems. Felicia von Reden, 29, is the cofounder of Ovom Care, a fertility clinic using AI to take the guesswork out of the IVF process. The company uses machine learning to identify the most viable eggs and sperm for a patient, and since opening its first clinic in 2024, the startup has helped 350 women on their IVF journeys‚Äîwhile raising some $8 million in funding at a $22 million valuation. Others are betting artificial technology will transform how we advertise and shop. Flore Lestrade, 26, Tristan Fran√ßois, 26, and Christian Kotait, 25, are building Veeton, a tool that allows clothing sellers to show their items using hyperrealistic AI fashion models. Their tech lets clothing companies show off a wide variety of sizes and styles‚Äîand for a whole lot cheaper. And then there‚Äôs Frederic Boesel and Jonas Muller, who are building text-to-image AI technology with their startup Black Forest Labs. The pair has raised $31 million in seed money from Andreessen Horowitz and is already partnering with corporations like German telecom titan Deutsche Telekom to help them generate all their marketing images with Forest Labs‚Äô model, Flux. All in all, the 2025 Under 30 Europe companies have raised more than $800 million in funding. WHY IT MATTERS To identify this standout group, Forbes editors worked with expert judges to review more than 10,000 candidates, evaluating them on impact, financials, and creativity. The result: 300 young leaders steering the future of Europe and harnessing a moment of global uncertainty to build the future‚Äôs next great companies.

2025-04-15 12:01:09,Nvidia Announces RTX 5060 Graphics Cards Priced From $299,"Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti will come in both 8GB and 16GB flavors this monthNvidia Nvidia has announced its highly anticipated GeForce RTX 5060-series graphics cards including pricing, availability and specifications. ForbesThe Verdicts Are In On Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce RTX 5070 And They‚Äôre MixedBy Antony Leather  Three separate models will be available, with the RTX 5060 Ti in both 16GB and 8GB flavors arriving April 16. The cheaper RTX 5060 non-Ti version will be available next month in May and will also have 8GB of video memory.  RTX 5060 And 5060 Ti Specifications  RTX 5060 And 5060 Ti Pricing Nvidia‚Äôs pricing is rumored to sit at just $299 for the RTX 5060, which is the same launch price as the RTX 4060, although it remains to be seen if supply can match demand on launch and if pricing will rise higher than this given the far higher premiums we‚Äôve seen for other RTX 50 series models such as the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090. ForbesAMD Reveals Radeon RX 9070 Series Pricing: Faster Than 7900XTXBy Antony Leather MORE FOR YOUGoogle Pixel‚Äôs Unbeatable Upgrade‚ÄîBad News For SamsungToday‚Äôs NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, April 16thHong Kong Post Suspends All Package Shipments To The U.S.‚ÄîBlames Tariffs  The RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and 8GB models are rumored to have launch prices of $429 and $379 respectively. For longevity given many games make use of more than 8GB of video memory already, the 16GB model is likely to be the most sought-after.  RTX 5060 And 5060 Ti PerformanceNvidia RTX 5060 Ti benchmark performanceNvidia  Unsurprisingly, the benchmarks Nvidia has released mostly include the use of frame generation, which has divided options with consumers and reviewers. Without it in Delta Force, the RTX 5060 Ti sees a frame rate rise from around 100fps with the RTX 4060 Ti to around 130fps. Elsewhere, the fact that the RTX 50-series cards support 4x frame generation, while older cards cap out at 2x isn‚Äôt particularly clear in the graph above (which uses the maximum frame generation mode for each card), and explains why the RTX 5060 Ti is further ahead.   We‚Äôll have to wait for reviews to land for a more comprehensive view on how the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti perform and these are expected to go live no later than April 16. These will include benchmarks against various other models of graphics cards as well as at different resolutions. AMD currently doesn‚Äôt have any of its new Radeon RX 9000-series models that sit at this price range, with the RX 9070 launching at $549. The Radeon RX 9060-series is expected in the near future, though, with the rumor mill already churning away on reports of RX 9060 XT 8GB and 16GB models. For now, Nvidia‚Äôs new cards will have to compete with previous generation models from both AMD‚Äôs Radeon RX 7000-series and Nvidia‚Äôs own RTX 4000-series.Nvidia's RTX 4060 TiAntony Leather AMD‚Äôs Radeon RX 7600 can be had for around $300 while the 7600 XT will set you back upwards of $400. Currently Nvidia‚Äôs RTX 4060 8GB costs around $330, with the RTX 4060 Ti available for less than $600 while the 16GB model rarely available for much less than $700. The release of the RTX 5060-series is likely to see prices of these older cards fall, assuming there is enough stock to prevent those annoying premiums, which is perhaps unrealistic given what‚Äôs happened following every RTX 50-series launch so far.

2025-04-15 12:08:00,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Apple, NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon.com and Alphabet","Chicago, IL ‚Äì April 15, 2025 ‚Äì Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Apple Inc AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.‚Äôs AMD, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL. With new tariffs being imposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese goods at the beginning of April,Apple IncandNVIDIA Corporationsaw their stocks decline. However, the latest tariff relief has been a blessing in disguise for these tech behemoths, helping them prevent higher import costs and product price rises. This has prompted speculation on which stock to invest in. Let‚Äôs explore ‚Äì President Trump‚Äôs steep tariffs on goods produced and imported from China could have disrupted Apple‚Äôs supply chains as severely as during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Apple breathed a sigh of relief after the Trump administration exempted electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs. Before the tariff exemption, Apple planned to increase iPhone production in India, which is subject to lower levies, while also securing its supply chain. Apple intends to produce over 30 million iPhones in India, satisfying a significant portion of American demand, which constitutes a third of global demand. However, Apple is manufacturing its upcoming iPhone 17 in China, which will be launched soon. Shifting the production base to India or another location in a short time will require a herculean effort. It may also lead to retaliation from China, which has set up inquiries into U.S. companies and may create difficulties for Apple through its customs processes. A complete breakup from China would be improbable as Apple produces the bulk of its iPhones in China, and there is a dearth of required skills to manufacture iPhones in the United States at the moment. Instead, Apple argued that the United States should boost semiconductor production and revive high-value job opportunities. However, the tariff relief is temporary, and if no breakthrough occurs soon, it may impact Apple‚Äôs near-term profitability. President Trump said that relying on China for vital tech goods like smartphones and semiconductors isn‚Äôt acceptable. If tariffs are imposed, iPhone prices will rise, impacting American consumers and Apple‚Äôs sales volume. Anyhow, some tariffs still apply to goods imported from China and there may be sectoral tariffs on goods that have semiconductors, which can further affect Apple‚Äôs stagnating revenues. Given the supply-chain risks, stagnant revenues and tariff uncertainties, Apple isn‚Äôt a favorable stock choice currently. Moreover, according to the price/earnings (P/E) ratio, Apple stock trades at 27.4X forward earnings. In comparison, the Computer - Micro Computers industry‚Äôs forward earnings multiple is 26.05. The Apple stock, therefore, is overvalued and may plummet if tariff issues remain unresolved. Like Apple, NVIDIA too got a momentary relief from Trump‚Äôs tariffs. This is because certain critical chips used by NVIDIA and produced in China were exempted. Now, there is a 90-day pause in tariffs, but the outcome depends on how the negotiations between the United States and its trade partners unfold. So, an element of ambiguity persists. However, NVIDIA remains the preferred stock to buy during these times of distress. With graphic processing units (GPUs) continuing to gain popularity at a breakneck speed and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending increasing, NVIDIA‚Äôs long-term future looks brighter. Lest we forget, Apple faces tough competition across all segments, economic challenges, and regulatory hazards, affecting its long-term outlook. Coming back to NVIDIA, the company is experiencing high demand for new Blackwell and older Hopper chips because of their superior AI interfaces compared to competitors. The company‚Äôs CUDA software platform is in more demand among developers thanAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.‚Äôs ROCm software platform. Major cloud computing companies likeAmazon.com, Inc.andAlphabet Inc.are also spending billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure, which could benefit NVIDIA (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy?). NVIDIA stock is currently more affordable than its competitors, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.18 compared to the Semiconductor - General industry‚Äôs 28.4X forward earnings multiple. This leads to NVIDIA having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, whereas Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today‚Äôs Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Interested in MP's $30 level. Rare earth metals are important because they're used in technology, electronics, defense, and literally everything with a computer, with China controlling over 80% of all REMs. It is noteworthy that China entirely refines these metals and produces 90% of the global supply of these magnets. We're back in BLOPS2 baby! 

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\-China has ordered its airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing jets and halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, a direct response to the U.S. imposing tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods. Interested in the $150 level. China is a significant market for BA, accounting for a substantial portion (20%!) of its projected deliveries over the next two decades. Despite being far smaller in comparison to Airbus, BA's planes are reserved years in advance, making it difficult for China to avoid using U.S. planes.

Onsemi said Tuesday that it has withdrawn its offer after determining that there is ""no actionable path forward."" ""While we continue to believe that a combination with onsemi would be beneficial to all stakeholders of both companies, after careful consideration, we have decided to withdraw our acquisition proposal given the reluctance of Allegro's Board of Directors to fully engage and explore our proposal,"" Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury said.

2025-04-15 14:08:43,Is NVIDIA (NVDA) the Best Machine Learning Stock to Buy Now?,"We recently published a list of the10 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other machine-learning stocks. Grand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It‚Äôs now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms. On April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄòSquawk Box‚Äô to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there‚Äôs a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek‚Äôs introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward. Jassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors. We sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey‚Äôs database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers essential GPUs and AI platforms that help develop and execute machine learning workloads. The company‚Äôs Compute & Networking segment encompasses the Data Center computing platforms and end-to-end networking platforms. It also includes the NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software. The company also customizes agentic solutions to accelerate enterprise AI adoption. Recently, the US introduced new AI Diffusion Rules that impact the global chip distribution. With this control, the spread of AI can be regulated. Despite this, Bank of America remains optimistic and reiterated a Buy rating on the company on March 28 with a $200 price target. This is mainly driven by the Blackwell system deployments by Large cloud service providers as their AI infrastructure demands expand. These CSPs include Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI. Other applications for the company‚Äôs GPUs include GenAI and deep learning in consumer internet companies like Meta. However, as larger tech companies try to make their own AI chips now, NVIDIA Corp.‚Äôs (NASDAQ:NVDA) market shares are threatened. It‚Äôs also facing increased competition with major tech players like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD. For instance, the company heavily relies on the 3nm process nodes that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes. These enable the production of smaller and more energy-efficient chips at NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA). Guinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024investor letter: ‚ÄúFor a second year running,NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund‚Äôs top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia‚Äôs ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia‚Äôs extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to ‚Äúinference‚Äù (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia‚Äôs financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia‚Äôs data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia‚Äôs technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia‚Äôs valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 5thon our list of the best machine learning stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

2025-04-15 14:18:00,3 Crypto Stocks to Buy the Dip Before Bitcoin Regains Lost Ground,"The cryptocurrency market has been suffering over the past month as multiple domestic and international factors continue to dent investor sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC), especially, has been taking a hit lately, with the cryptocurrency falling below $74,000 earlier last week on fears that the economy could slip into a recession after President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs. However, Bitcoin has regained some of the lost ground over the past week after Trump temporarily paused the tariffs, and the cryptocurrency is on track to resume its northbound journey. That said, Bitcoin is still sharply below its all-time high attained late last year and it is an ideal time to buy the dip. We have selected three stocks, such asInteractive Brokers Group, Inc.IBKR,NVIDIA CorporationNVDA andRobinhood Markets, Inc.HOOD. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Bitcoin started a fresh increase last week after Trump announced a 90-day halt on tariffs. He had earlier announced a 10% baseline tariff on all trading partners of the United States and a staggering 145% tariff on Chinese imports. Wall Street recorded one of its worst days following the announcement, with indexes plunging sharply, resulting in $6.2 trillion being wiped out of markets in just two sessions. However, markets made a solid rebound just a day later after Trump announced a temporary pause, with the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recording one of their best days in Wall Street‚Äôs history. Bitcoin has since resumed its ascent and was hovering above $85,750 on Monday night and is on track to surpass $90,000. Also, inflation declined unexpectedly in March. The consumer price index fell 0.1% month over month in March, its first monthly decline since May 2020. This has raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could resume its interest rate cuts in the coming months. Higher interest rates for a longer period can have a negative impact on cryptocurrencies by dampening investor interest in high-risk assets, increasing the cost of holding non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin, and strengthening the U.S. dollar, which is often considered a headwind for the crypto market. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR‚Äôs commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures. Interactive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 2.1% for the current year.

2025-04-15 15:18:17,GOP Senators Go to War Over AI Chips: Will Washington Hand China the Upper Hand?,"Seven Republican senators justfireda warning shot at the Biden administrationand U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) should be paying close attention. In a letter sent Friday and released Monday, the senators urged Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to immediately withdraw a sweeping export restriction on AI chips set to kick in May 15. Their argument? The rule, meant to block China, could backfire hardcrippling American innovation, stalling global deals, and driving U.S. partners into Beijing's arms. Every day this rule remains in place, they wrote, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The heart of the issue lies in a three-tier system that gives just 18 countries smooth access to U.S. AI technologywhile leaving most allies like Israel stuck in red tape purgatory. The rule limits who can buy what, adds strict licensing hurdles, and, critics argue, creates so much friction that Tier 2 nations may look elsewhere. Translation? They'll turn to China's unregulated cheap substitutes. And once those doors close, American firms may never win them back. What we're seeing here isn't just policy tug-of-warit's a full-blown fracture inside Washington. On one side: national security hawks demanding hard lines. On the other: free-market conservatives warning that overplaying the hand could choke U.S. dominance in the hottest tech race of our time. The clock's ticking. And if the rule takes effect unchanged, U.S. chipmakers could be the ones left holding the bag.

Apple, which assembles a majority of its devices in China, has seen its stock come under considerable pressure in recent weeks amid an intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing that has resulted inescalating tit-for-tat tariffs, prompting concerns that increasing manufacturing costs could weigh on consumer demand. The iPhone maker‚Äôs shares rebounded 5% last week but have lost about a fifth of their value since the start of the year. By comparison, theS&P 500jumped 6% last week and is down about 8% for the year so far. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Apple‚Äôs chart and point out crucial price levels worth watching. After setting theirrecord highin late December, Apple shares have trended lower, possibly completing anElliott Wavepattern, with five distinct price swings after which sentiment typically shifts. The stock appeared to gain momentum in recent trading sessions following last Wednesday‚Äôsrecord-breaking relief rallythat saw the stock log its largest one-day gain in nearly three decades. The shares have recorded above-averagevolumesince President Trump announced sweeping tariffs earlier this month, signaling increased trading activity as market participants position for further news-driven price swings. Let‚Äôs identify crucialsupport and resistancelevels on Apple‚Äôs chart that could grab investors‚Äô attention. A loss of momentum in the stock could see the shares initially fall to around $183. This area on the chart may provide support near ahorizontal linethat connects a range ofprice actionstretching back to January last year. Selling below this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $169. Investors may look to scoop up shares in this region near last week‚Äôs low, which also closely aligns with a period ofsideways drifton the chart throughout March and April last year. Further buying this week could see the shares touch overhead resistance around $220. Tactical traders who haveaccumulated sharesat lower levels may decide tolock in profitsin this region near a trendline that links last June‚Äôs prominentpeakwith several troughs spanning from July to January. Finally, abreakoutabove this area could trigger a move to the $247 level.

2025-04-15 18:25:49,How the US-China Trade War Could Change the Economy,"Consumers, businesses, and even the prospects for U.S. manufacturing are all likely to become casualties in the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, trade experts say.Last week, the presidentshifted tariffsto temporarily take some of the pressure off of other countries while punishing China, which hasretaliated against the U.S. with tariffs of its own. As of Monday, China faced a tariff of 145% on its products, with atemporary reprievefor electronic devices.Economists predicted the trade war between the world'stwo largest economieswould have serious consequences for American consumers and workers. The tariffs, which started this month, could quickly increase the prices shoppers see at popular online and brick-and-mortar retailers.""Most of the things you might see on the inside of the store at a Target or a Walmart or on Amazon, I think we would expect significant price increases pretty immediately,"" said Christopher Conlon, an associate professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University.Clothing,toys, and plastic items with small electronics in them (such as vacuums, toasters, and small appliances) will likely be among the first products to see immediate price increases. Conlon estimated about 50% to 60% of Amazon's offerings would be affected, and many would rise by about the same amount as the tariffs.Conlon had some advice for consumers that economists don't usually give: it might make sense to buy certain items before prices go up.""If you have the cash on hand and you're really worried about buying some of these things, it might not be the worst idea to stock up on them,"" he said, noting that big-ticket items that last a long time, like appliances, would make the most sense to buy now. ""The big caveat is, of course, next week, we could be having a completely different conversation about tariffs because this situation is evolving very quickly."" Eventually, manufacturers could adapt to the tariffs bymoving production out of Chinato countries like Vietnam or Mexico, which have lower tariff rates, at least for the time being, Conlon said.But could all the short-term pain result in long-term gain? The tariffs are meant torestore U.S. manufacturingto its glory days after WWII, when America, not China, was the world's factory, by encouraging businesses to set up plants in the U.S. rather than abroad. There are a few obstacles standing in the way of that outcome, said Sina Golara, assistant professor of supply chain and operations management at Georgia State University‚Äôs Robinson College of Business.For one thing, even as high as the tariffs are, it still might be more cost-effective to manufacture many things in China than in the U.S., Golara said. Companies hoping to set up in the U.S. would have to not only build a factory but also replicate the infrastructure and supply networks that have been built up over decades. On top of that, U.S. workers are paid more than their Chinese counterparts, adding to production costs.""The cost gap is so much that even tariffs being as high as they are today would still not make it expensive enough to be worth moving everything to the United States,"" Golara said.In addition, the tariffs themselves are an obstacle because they make it more expensive for a factory located in the U.S. to import parts and materials from other countries. Another headwind for the U.S. economy is that China has some leverage to harm American consumers and companies with its own trade policies. China could cut off imports from U.S. companies and stop exports of certain important minerals used in advanced manufacturing, of which China is the main or only supplier, Conlon said. Experts said the best possible outcome of the showdown for the economy would be if both sides reached a deal to lower tariffs on one another. However, thesprawling nature of Trump's trade warcomplicates that task, as does the pattern ofon-again, off-again tariff announcements.""There's another case where you engage in a war, and then you just dial back half of your tariffs,"" Golara said. ""In that case, you're really hurting everyone, except you're hurting everyone else a little bit more ... it's kind of like a mutual destruction tool.""",News,https://www.investopedia.com/economists-see-few-winners-in-us-china-trade-war-11715135,3

2025-04-15 21:20:25,That Wall Street Guru in Your DMs: The Scam Costing People Millions and How to Protect Yourself,"You're discussing a recent market dip in a social media investment forum when a message arrives. Someone claiming to represent a famous investor such as Bill Ackman or Cathie Wood has noticed your comments and offers to include you in an exclusive investment group where they trade tips on accumulating extraordinary returns. Their profile looks legit, complete with professional credentials and up-to-date market analysis. Soon, you're in a private WhatsApp group with other ""successful investors,"" feeling like you've been specially selected for an insider opportunity. However, it's all part of an elaborate scam the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) says has been exploding across digital platforms. According to the FTC, Americans lost $5.7 billion in 2024 toinvestment scams, a 24% increase from the previous year and a 50% jump over two years. Most concerning is that scammers are becoming even more effective. The percentage of people who reported losing money to fraud jumped dramatically, from 27% in 2023 to 38% in 2024, about a 40% increase in the success rate for scammers. Thus, despite officials and financial experts warning numerous times about ID theft and fraud, scam artists have only become more successful in recent years.Marti DeLiema, assistant research professor at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, told a FINRA roundtable on fraud that she and her colleagues have found that most educational initiatives can only have so much impact. ""Maybe the biggest limitation of consumer protection education is that it has ... short-term effects,""¬†she said. One reason is simply that scam artists aren't sitting still as people are educated about the previous generation of scams. ""Fraud tactics are constantly changing,"" Duygu Ba≈üaran ≈ûahin, a researcher at the RAND Center for the Study of Aging, said in the same FINRA discussion. But there's also something counterintuitive at work: ""People with higher financial literacy and with more education were more likely to engage with scammers,"" he said. Also, according to the FTC, contrary to stereotypes, young people reported losing money to fraud more often than older people‚Äî44% were 20-29 years old, while only 24% were 70-79 years old. Even experienced investors with market knowledge are often duped by the increasingly sophisticated techniques scammers employ. The examples abound: A construction company owner who regularly followed market trends losing half his savings, a Nashville couple with investment experience getting taken for $1.3 million.A February 2025 survey of 2,000 high-net-worth individuals by Saltus in the U.K. found that a third (33%) had been victims of fraud and other cybercrime. So, it's not just the elderly, naive, or inexperienced who are taken in. What's more, guru impersonation scams are often as carefully staged as any Broadway production. The first step typically involvesidentity theft,as scammers create convincing online impersonations of well-known financial figures like Bill Ackman, Cathie Wood, or even Warren Buffett. These fake profiles appear on platforms where potential victims already spend time discussing investments. The scammers might begin to engage the target by commenting on market trends or offering general advice. FINRA Once they've established basic credibility, scammers move the conversation to private messaging groups on platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram.Once there, the targets witness what appears to be a community of successful investors sharing tips on earning substantial profits. In reality, most or all of these ""members"" are fake accounts operated by the scammers. These manufactured success stories build a sense ofFOMO(fear of missing out) that drives victims to participate, while the scammers pepper in mainstream advice to develop and keep credibility. As trust deepens, the scam takes the exploitative turn it was always headed for. The targets are encouraged to invest in low-priced, low-volume stocks, oftenpenny stocks, on foreign exchanges where prices are more easily manipulated. This follows the classic ""pump-and-dump"" pattern, where fraudsters manipulate stock prices through misleading promotional campaigns. Investment scams continue to evolve at an alarming pace, and with the help ofAI, fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated at creating their bogus scenarios, while cryptocurrencies help make their ill-gotten earnings untraceable afterward. Meanwhile, we're ever more accessible to them. ""Fraudsters can get us with emails, texts, social media, even phone calls still 24/7,"" said Gary Mottola, research director for the FINRA Foundation. ""The odds [of getting duped] have increased dramatically with technology [that] the fraudsters [can use to dupe the unwitting].""",News,https://www.investopedia.com/wall-street-guru-in-your-dms-11707904,4

2025-04-15 22:18:17,"Why Have Mortgage Rates Surged? The Answer Is Murky, But Here's What Experts Think.","The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Mortgage rates are notoriously difficult to predict, as they're determined by a complex interaction of various macroeconomic and industry factors. However, the movement of one particular metric,the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, can generally be relied on as a direct precursor to movement in fixed mortgage rates. When President Trump unveiled stiffer-than-expected global tariffs on April 2,the stock market plunged. And per conventional market logic, the bond market moved the other way‚Äîsending U.S. Treasury prices higher and yields lower (bond prices and yields move in opposite directions). When the 10-year Treasury yield falls,mortgage rates typically decline as well. And that's what we saw for the first two days after Trump's announcement, which occurred on a Wednesday afternoon. But by the following Monday, Treasury yields abruptly reversed course. And they didn't stop for five days. By the end of last week, the 10-year Treasury yield had surged an eye-popping 47 basis points.It was thebiggest weekly increasesince the financial crisis of 2008. This was terrible news for house hunters waiting to lock in a more affordablemortgage rate. As recently as early March, the 30-year mortgage rate average clocked in at a four-month low of 6.50%. But after rising 44 basis points last week, Friday's flagship mortgage average had shot up to 7.14%. It was thelargest Friday-to-Friday increasein almost three years. Many financial experts have been scratching their heads about the dramatic turn of events forTreasury yields, as the stock market continued tumbling through last Tuesday (before beginning a slow recovery Wednesday). What caused bond prices to sink at the same time that the stock market was also still declining? One theory is that investors predict tariff-triggered trade wars will pushinflationhigher by way of more expensive consumer goods. If inflation rises, that could force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high for longer. And that, in turn, makes locking in today's Treasury rates less appealing‚Äîdriving their price down. Another top theory is that Trump's stricter-than-expected global tariffs could cause foreign governments to retaliate bydumping their U.S. bonds. Or even aside from retaliation, countries may opt to buy fewer new U.S. bonds going forward. In both cases, this could drive U.S. bond prices lower. In all scenarios right now, the dominant theme is ""uncertainty"". With it unclear which countries will retaliate, which will negotiate, and which tariffs President Trump may choose to retract or soften‚Äîand, as a result, how inflation and economic growth will be impacted‚Äîmarkets and the Federal Reserve are in a state of limbo awaiting greater market clarity. The Fed next meets on May 6‚Äì7, and at this time, interest rate traders have priced in a greater than 80% probability that the central bankers will leave rates where they are. As for mortgage rates, they have seen a slight bit of relief so far this week, witha mild drop Monday, and Tuesday rates moving lower still.

2025-04-15 23:24:51,"NVIDIA flags $5.5 bln Q1 charge on US chip export curbs, shares sink","Investing.com -- AI powerhouse NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed on Tuesday that it anticipates up to $5.5 billion in charges in its upcoming first-quarter financial results related to U.S. chip export controls on China, sending its shares down sharply in aftermarket trade. The announcement follows the U.S. government‚Äôs decision to mandate licenses for exports of the H20 chip to China, including Hong Kong and Macau, as well as to D:5 countries or companies with ultimate parent companies in those regions. Shares of NVIDIA fell 6% to $105.42 in after-hours trading following the news. Those of peers such as AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) sank between 2% and 7%, while major Nvidia supplier TSMC (NYSE:TSM) shed 2.4%. The disclosure from NVIDIA comes just one day after the company made headlines after announcing a $500 billion investment to produce AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. The U.S. government communicated to NVIDIA on April 9, 2025, that a license would be required for exporting the H20 integrated circuits, as well as any other circuits with similar memory and interconnect bandwidth capabilities. On April 14, 2025, it was further clarified that this licensing requirement would remain in place indefinitely. The measure is intended to prevent the potential use of Nvidia‚Äôs products in Chinese supercomputers or military applications. Nvidia said the $5.5 billion charge is related to inventory, purchase commitments, and associated reserves for its H20 microchip products. ""The financial impact is small relatively, but the strategic blow is the focus of the market as Nvidia now has massive blockades going after the China market in the middle of this raging US/China tariff battle,"" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note. ""Nvidia is a key strategic asset for the US and the Trump Administration during this very tense period with China...and the White House is going to make sure Jensen and Nvidia‚Äôs chips do not land in China for now and help Beijing in the AI Revolution."" The H20 chip is the main AI chip Nvidia is permitted to sell in China under export restrictions imposed by the Biden administration, as it sought to close off Beijing‚Äôs access to cutting-edge advancements in AI tech. Still, earlier media reports showed Nvidia clocked strong demand for its H20 chips in China, as Chinese AI development and investment ramped up following the release of DeepSeek earlier this year. The Information reported earlier in April that Chinese firms including ByteDance,AlibabaGroup (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) had ordered at least $16 billion worth of H20 chips in the first three months of 2025.

Treasury yields dipped slightly ahead of a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later in the day. Traders are wondering if he will echo the dovish tone set by his colleague Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Overnight, Washington issued new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China.

""The broader focus still remains on tariffs,"" said Aneeka Gupta, economist and strategist at WisdomTree. ""In China, we've had the restrictions raise concerns that access to global tech hardware would be further choked off,"" Gupta said.

The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency against six peers, slid 0.5% to around its lowest since April 2022 in a sign investors remained cautious about U.S. assets. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc, seen as safe assets during market turbulence, rallied around 0.4% and 0.6% respectively. The yen is trading around its highest level since September while the franc is at its highest in 10 years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda told the Sankei newspaper that the central bank may need to take policy action if U.S. tariffs hurt the Japanese economy, signalling the potential to pause the bank's rate-hiking cycle.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks on the move. Market uncertainty aside, the AI race is tighter than ever. A report by Stanford University‚Äôs Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) states that not only has the battlefield become tighter, but also more crowded than previously. The report notes that Google and OpenAI are neck to neck in the race to build cutting-edge AI, and that other companies are fiercely closing in. Meta, Anthropic, and Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI are a few of these names. Chinese competitors are also closing in on the AI race. In particular, DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 model is very close to the top-performing models of two of the leading AI companies. ‚ÄúIt creates an exciting space. It‚Äôs good that these models are not all developed by five guys in Silicon Valley. Chinese models are catching up as far as performance to the US models..but across the globe, there are new players emerging in the space.‚Äù In recent news, OpenAI has launched its new AI model GPT-4.1, along with smaller versions GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano. These models boast major improvements in coding, instruction following, and long context comprehension. READ NOW:10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatilityand14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street‚Äôs Attention According to OpenAI, the models outperform the company‚Äôs most advanced GPT-4o model across the board and are available only on OpenAI‚Äôs application programming interface (API). In particular, the GPT-4.1 brags a 21% improvement over GPT-4o and 27% over GPT-4.5 on coding. Moreover, there are improvements in instruction following and long context comprehension, which make these models a better choice for powering AI agents. ‚ÄúBenchmarks are strong, but we focused on real-world utility, and developers seem very happy.‚Äù OpenAI also noted that these models operate at a ‚Äúmuch lower cost‚Äù compared to GPT-4.5, and that the company would turn off the GPT-4.5 preview that is available in the API in July because the new models offer ‚Äúimproved or similar performance.‚Äù For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

On April 14,Reutersreported that the company is planning to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. Seeking help from partners such as TSMC, the announcement includes production of its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC‚Äôs factory in Phoenix, Arizona, and supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas by Foxconn and Wistron. Analysts believe that the move aligns with those of tech firms who have pledged to bring manufacturing back to the US. ‚ÄúIt is unlikely Nvidia would have moved any production to the U.S. if it was not for pressure from the Trump administration. The half a trillion number is likely hyperbole, in the same way Apple made a half a trillion promise.‚Äù CEO Jensen Huang said that his company sees little short-term impact from higher U.S. tariffs. Nevertheless, they would move production to the U.S. in the longer term. ‚ÄúAdding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 3rdon our list of AI stocks on the move. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

2025-04-16 07:56:35,Global tech stocks slump as ASML warning adds to Nvidia curbs,"(Bloomberg) ‚Äî Technology stocks fell as new US government restrictions on the export of Nvidia Corp. chips to China and a disappointing report from Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML Holding NV (ASML) fanned trade war concerns. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration has barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip in China, an escalation of Washington‚Äôs tech battle with Beijing. ASML later added to investor anxiety by posting orders that missed expectations and saying that it doesn‚Äôt know how to quantify the impact of recent tariff announcements. The latest developments show how tariffs are already wreaking havoc on global companies, while the trade war is extending beyond mere import taxes as well. The fallout could weigh on chip-sector earnings and also set back China‚Äôs ambitions to compete on the global tech stage. The H20 restrictions are ‚Äúdriven by concerns over China‚Äôs rise in the electronics sector, and in that sense, it is likely to become a permanent policy,‚Äù said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. ‚ÄúIt is expected to have a significant negative impact on semiconductor supply chain.‚Äù Nvidia warned that it will report around $5.5 billion in related charges during the fiscal first quarter. Its shares slid about 5% in late US trading Tuesday. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) later extended losses to more than 2% after ASML‚Äôs report. Among key suppliers, Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. slumped as much as 3.9% Wednesday. Top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM,2330.TW) fell 2.9%. Japanese chip-equipment maker Advantest Corp. dropped as much as 7.8%, extending its fall after ASML‚Äôs statement. TSMC was already likely to slow some production expansion on a weaker economic outlook, and ‚Äúthe tighter rules on Nvidia‚Äôs China sales might amplify the deceleration,‚Äù Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Hui wrote in a note. For China, the broader restrictions raise concerns that access to global tech hardware will be further choked off. Exports of the most-advanced chips and equipment to the Asian nation are already banned, and the H20 is a scaled-down product specifically designed not to be too powerful. Even after DeepSeek raised hopes that advances can be made in artificial intelligence and other fields without the most cutting-edge chips, China‚Äôs tech giants may suffer if curbs keep getting extended. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA,9988.HK) sank as much as 5.4% in Hong Kong trading Wednesday, while Baidu Inc. (BIDU,9888.HK) fell 3.3%. ‚ÄúIt is a reminder of the potential susceptibility of tech stocks to the ongoing prickly relationship between the US and China regarding semiconductors,‚Äù said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade in Sydney. ‚ÄúThere is a reliance on the H20 chip from big name players in the Asian tech space, so any moves which could impact supply will be a drag on the broader sector.‚Äù On the other side of the equation, China continues to work toward self-reliance in technology, though its companies are still seen lagging far behind advanced global leaders like Nvidia. Among Chinese hardware stocks bucking the regional sector declines Wednesday, Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd. (HK0000218211.SG) jumped as much as 6.6% in Hong Kong while Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. rose 2.1% in Shanghai. ‚ÄúAI innovation in China is booming and the H20 ban would not dampen it ‚Äî it may accelerate the use of China domestic chips,‚Äù said Vey-Sern Ling, a managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. ‚ÄúDomestic AI chips may not perform as well as Nvidia‚Äôs H20, but that is missing the point. China has been able to develop innovative AI models despite US restrictions.‚Äù ‚ÄîWith assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi.

2025-04-16 08:06:00,3 Pricey Stocks Billionaire Money Managers Sold Ahead of Wall Street's Historic Volatility,"Every so often, Wall Street reminds investors that stocks don't move higher in a straight line. Sometimes,these reminders are anything but subtle. Over the last two weeks, investors have witnessed volatility akin to the COVID-19 crash of February-March 2020, as well as during the height of the financial crisis in 2008. On one end of the spectrum, theDow Jones Industrial Average,S&P 500, andNasdaq Compositeall logged their largest individual point gains on April 9 since their respective inceptions. Conversely, these indexes have endured some of their largest nominal point declines on record followingPresident Donald Trump's April 2nd Liberation Day tariff announcement. Image source: Getty Images. Although history has shown that outsized volatility tends to create phenomenal buying opportunities for patient investors, some of Wall Street's brightest money managers appear to have seen these warning signs for the stock market well in advance. In particular, select billionaire investors sold shares of three incredibly popular but pricey stocks ahead of Wall Street's record-setting bout of volatility. The first pricey but cutting-edge stock that billionaires were jettisoning prior to Wall Street's wild vacillations isartificial intelligence (AI)-driven data-mining specialistPalantir Technologies(PLTR6.27%). Billionaire Philippe Laffont, who oversees close to $29.7 billion in assets at Coatue Management, dumped more than 4.81 million shares of Palantir during the second quarter of 2024. It's a similar story for Duquesne Family Office's billionaire chief Stanley Druckenmiller, who sold more than 728,000 shares of Palantir after March 31, 2024. On the surface, Palantir has a lot to offer. Both of its AI-powered software-as-a-service platforms, Gotham and Foundry, are irreplaceable at scale. Additionally, Gotham tends to lock in contracts with federal governments spanning four or five years, while Foundry is a subscription-based model that incents business loyalty. This is to say that on top of Palantir having a sustainable moat, its cash flow tends to be highly predictable. However, there's a degree of near-term growth uncertainty hovering around Palantir at present. President Trump's efforts to rein in federal spending are casting doubt on what the defense budget might look like over the coming four years. Gotham relies heavily on contracts from the U.S. government. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast is alsocalling for the steepest contraction in organic gross domestic product (GDP)for the U.S. economy (excluding the COVID-19 quarters) since the tail-end of the Great Recession -- a 2.4% decline, based on an April 9 update. This suggests the commercially focused Foundry segment might endure subpar subscription growth in the coming quarters. But what's really been a hard pill to swallow is Palantir's valuation. During previous technology and next-big-thing innovation bubbles, leading-edge businesses peaked atprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiosin the neighborhood of 30 to 40. Palantir stock traded at roughly 100 times sales when it hit its all-time closing high less than two months ago. Even after a modest pullback, Palantir is still commanding a P/S ratio of 75, whichis a level that's never been sustainable throughout history. Image source: Getty Images. Palantir wasn't the only ultra-popular AI stock that was largely shown the door ahead of Wall Street's historic volatility. Semiconductor kingpinNvidia(NVDA1.30%)is a juggernaut thatfour billionaire money managers sent to the chopping block: What made Nvidia such a popular stock to ownis its near-monopoly share of the graphics processing units (GPUs) that act as the brains in AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and next-generation Blackwell GPUs are what power AI solutions, as well as the training of most large language models. But the dicey thing about next-big-thing trends is they've allworked their way through an early stage bubble-bursting eventover the last 30-plus years. Dating back to the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, every game-changing innovation has eventually failed to meet investors' lofty expectations. All technologies need time to mature, but investors consistently overestimate early adoption rates and/or utility. If the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia stock would almost certainly be hit hard. Nvidia also faces the threat of growing internal competition. Many of its top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs and solutions of their own to use in their data centers. While this hardware isn't a threat to the superior computing speed of Nvidia's AI-GPUs, it is notably cheaper and more accessible. This is a recipe for Nvidia to lose out on valuable data center real estate, and for its gross margin to decline. Though Nvidia isn't pricey relative to its forward-year earnings, it is still valued at a P/S ratio of 21. While this is down 50% from its P/S ratio of 42 last summer, it's still more than double the P/S ratios of its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers. The third pricey stock billionaire money managers were sellers of prior to Wall Street's wild volatility isfast-casual restaurant chainChipotle Mexican Grill(CMG-1.42%). During the December-ended quarter, Coatue's Philippe Laffont completely exited his fund's stake in Chipotle by selling nearly 4.6 million shares. Additionally, billionaire Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Managementaxed close to 16.6 million split-adjusted shares throughout 2024. The ""split-adjusted"" aspect takes into account thatChipotle Mexican Grill effected a 50-for-1 forward split in June. Like the other companies listed here, Chipotle presents with competitive advantages that have made it a popular stock to own. Its use of responsibly raised meats and locally sourced vegetables (when possible) speaks to consumers who prefer organic and natural foods. Plus, using only fresh ingredients and keeping its menu relatively small allows staff to quickly prepare meals and keep the queue moving. Furthermore, Chipotle's introduction of mobile-dedicated drive-thru lanes (known as ""Chipotlanes"") prior to the pandemic led to an entirely new source of revenue for the company. But it's not all peaches and cream, or should I say avocados and beans, for Chipotle. While it's benefited from the willingness of consumers to pay a higher price for organic and natural foods, there comes a point where inflationary pressures begin to weigh on the company's margins and/or its customer base. During the December-ended quarter, the company's comparable restaurant sales growth clocked in at only 5.4%. This is well below its historic average, which potentially signals that inflationary pressures are hitting home.

2025-04-16 08:11:25,"Exclusive: Nvidia kept some China customers in the dark about new US chip clampdown, sources say","By Fanny Potkin and Liam Mo SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA) did not warn at least some major customers in advance about new U.S. export rules it was told about a week ago requiring it to obtain licenses to sell its China-focused artificial intelligence chip, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. chipmaker disclosed on Tuesday that American officials had informed the company on April 9 that its H20 chip would require an export license for sales to China. The move to restrict H20 shipments marks Washington's latest effort to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, as the United States seeks to maintain its edge in AI technology. Major Chinese cloud companies were still anticipating H20 deliveries by year-end, unaware of the impending restrictions, according to the two sources, who said Nvidia's China sales team also did not appear to be informed ahead of the public announcement. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Nvidia declined to comment. The export controls threaten Nvidia's business in China, one of its largest markets. Nvidia had secured $18 billion of H20 orders since the start of the year, according to one of the two sources and a third source. China generated $17 billion in revenue, or 13% of Nvidia's total sales, in its last fiscal year that ended on January 26. Nvidia shares fell 6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after it said it would take up to $5.5 billion of charges in the first quarter ending April 27 due to the licensing requirement, which the U.S. government told it on Monday would be indefinite. The charges are associated with inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves for H20 products, the company said. Chinese tech giants including Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, had increased orders for H20 chips amid surging demand for affordable AI models from companies like startup DeepSeek, Reuters reported in February. Alibaba (BABA), ByteDance and Tencent (TCEHY,0700.HK) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The H20 is the primary chip Nvidia is legally permitted to sell in China and was launched after the latest round of U.S. export restrictions took effect in October 2023. Washington has banned exports of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China since 2022, concerned that advanced technologies could be used by China to build up its military capabilities. The restrictions on H20 could benefit Chinese AI chipmakers, particularly Huawei, which offers competing products to Nvidia's lineup, analysts said. ""By restricting the H20 system, U.S. regulators are effectively pushing Nvidia's Chinese customers toward Huawei's AI chips,"" said Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners. ""Huawei's chip design and software capabilities are likely to advance quickly as it gains more customers and development experience,"" Chiou added.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las ... More Vegas, Nevada.AFP via Getty Images  Key Facts   In a filing with the SEC on Tuesday night, the chipmaker said the U.S. government has informed the company it will require a special license to export its H20 AI chips to ‚ÄúChina (including Hong Kong and Macau),‚Äù or to companies headquartered in the country.    The H20 is a cut-down version of Nvidia‚Äôs more advanced AI chips like the H100, which were specifically designed to comply with earlier restrictions on exporting the company‚Äôs top semiconductors to China.    The U.S. government informed Nvidia that the licensing requirement for H20 exports to China will be in place ‚Äúfor the indefinite future,‚Äù and the rules aim to address ‚Äúthe risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.‚Äù    The company said it expects to take a $5.5 billion hit in its first quarter results for its 2026 fiscal year.

The slide follows an already difficult start to the year for the world‚Äôs most valuable chipmaker, whose shares have fallen 16.45% since the start of 2025. Nasdaq futures were down 1.3% to 18,716.00 points in the premarket, while the S&P 500 was down 0.66% to 5,392.25 points.  What Do We Know About Nvidia Ceo‚Äôs Mar-A-Lago Dinner? Earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1 million-per-head fundraising dinner for the super PAC MAGA Inc. at Mar-a-Lago, headlined by the president. According to NPR, Jensen‚Äôs attendance prompted the Trump administration to put additional restrictions on H20 exports on hold. The report said the export controls had been in the works for several months and were set to go into effect last week. The White House had purportedly agreed to back down on the restrictions after Nvidia promised to make major investments in data centers in the U.S. It is unclear why the White House has decided to go forward with the restrictions anyway. Lawmakers from both parties, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., had been calling for such curbs. What Do We Know About Nvidia‚Äôs Planned Investments In The U.s.? On Monday, Nvidia announced plans to build two factories in Houston and Dallas that will allow it to assemble its AI supercomputers entirely on U.S. soil. Nvidia has partnered with Taiwanese manufacturing giants Foxconn and Wistron to build the factories and said it expects mass production at the two plants to ramp up within ‚Äú12-15 months.‚Äù The White House touted the announcement as a major win for Trump‚Äôs policies and said the president ‚Äúhas made U.S.-based chip manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it‚Äôs paying off.‚Äù Tangent Shares of Dutch company ASML‚Äîthe maker of the world‚Äôs most advanced chipmaking machines‚Äîfell 6% after markets opened in Europe on Wednesday.

More event in Mumbai, India, on 12 April, 2025. (Photo by Indranil Aditya / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP) (Photo by INDRANIL ADITYA/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images Trefis  Consider this: we‚Äôre currently in the midst of an intense trade war, with the U.S. government pushing for onshore manufacturing. Simultaneously, semiconductors have emerged as the cornerstone of the modern U.S. economy, powering everything from AI to defense. The government has identified semiconductors as a critical component of national security, with a focus on protecting American AI innovation and intellectual property. With the largest domestic chip production capacity, Intel stock appears well-positioned to benefit from these macro trends. The company has proactively invested $95 billion in capital expenditures over the past four years to build its foundry capacity. Yet, the stock has underperformed, falling nearly 3% year-to-date and dropping 45% over the past year. Investor confidence in Intel‚Äôs foundry ambitions remains low, particularly given the unit posted nearly $13 billion in losses last year. However, a turnaround could be on the horizon as Intel ramps up production of its advanced 18A process and is reportedly close to securing Nvidia as a foundry customer.  The Scaling Up Of The 18A Process The Intel 3 process node has already entered mass production and is currently used for manufacturing Xeon 6 data center processors. Intel has begun sampling chips made using its latest 18A process with laptop manufacturers. The company has previously touted the 18A process as a means to reclaim ‚Äúprocess leadership‚Äù‚Äîessentially regaining the lead in semiconductor manufacturing technology after years of trailing industry giants TSMC and Samsung. Intel‚Äôs 18A process includes key innovations. While both the Intel 18A and TSMC‚Äôs N2 nodes utilize gate-all-around transistors, Intel has added backside power delivery to its design, enhancing efficiency and performance. Confidence in Intel‚Äôs technology appears to be growing among customers. Microsoft and Amazon have already engaged Intel to fabricate custom chips, including AI accelerators, and this momentum may build further.   Could Intel Win Over Nvidia‚Äôs Business? To date, Intel‚Äôs confirmed foundry clients have largely been non-traditional semiconductor players such as Amazon, Microsoft, Tower Semiconductor, and MediaTek. However, according to UBS, Nvidia may consider using Intel Foundry for manufacturing its gaming GPUs. Securing Nvidia‚Äîcurrently the world‚Äôs largest fabless chip designer‚Äîwould be a significant breakthrough for Intel‚Äôs foundry strategy. In addition to the standard 18A node, Intel is developing a performance-enhanced variant called 18A-P. This version could appeal to customers seeking better performance or energy efficiency, similar to enhanced versions of TSMC‚Äôs nodes. The 18A-P node may also offer improved yields, reduced variability, and a more refined manufacturing process. Other AI-focused semiconductor companies, including Broadcom and AMD, have also expressed interest in Intel‚Äôs services, though Nvidia appears furthest along in its evaluation. It‚Äôs important to note that Nvidia‚Äôs interest currently centers on gaming GPUs, not its high-performance AI chips. Nevertheless, if Intel can prove the competitiveness of its process technology, it could eventually expand into producing AI chips for other clients as well.  Preserve & Grow Wealth with Risk-Focused Quality Portfolios MORE FOR YOUGoogle Pixel‚Äôs Unbeatable Upgrade‚ÄîBad News For SamsungToday‚Äôs NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, April 16thDelete All Texts On Your Phone If You See These 2 Words  Intel stock has seen highly volatile performance over the last four years, unlike the more stable S&P 500. Annual returns were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, a sharp rebound of 95% in 2023, followed by a 60% decline in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has exhibited significantly lower volatility. It has also outperformed the S&P 500 over the same four-year span. Why is that? The HQ Portfolio comprises stocks that deliver higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index‚Äîa smoother ride, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So, is now the right time to consider buying Intel stock?  Intel stock currently trades at less than 18x projected 2026 earnings‚Äîa reasonable valuation. Admittedly, the company faces headwinds, including falling earnings in recent years, market share losses to AMD in both PC and server markets, and the broader shift from CPUs to GPUs amid the AI boom. That said, if the foundry unit executes effectively on the 18A process and secures marquee customers like Nvidia, the stock could enjoy substantial upside.

2025-04-16 08:26:25,Global Tech Stocks Slump as ASML Warning Adds to Nvidia Curbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Technology stocks fell as new US government restrictions on the export of Nvidia Corp. chips to China and a disappointing report from Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML Holding NV fanned trade war concerns. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration has barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip in China, an escalation of Washington‚Äôs tech battle with Beijing. ASML later added to investor anxiety by posting orders that missed expectations and saying that it doesn‚Äôt know how to quantify the impact of recent tariff announcements, sending shares as much as 7.6% lower in Amsterdam. The latest developments show how tariffs are already wreaking havoc on global companies, while the trade war is extending beyond mere import taxes as well. The fallout could weigh on chip-sector earnings and also set back China‚Äôs ambitions to compete on the global tech stage. ASML‚Äôs drop weighed on Europe‚Äôs technology sector, with losses across chip equipment peers pushing the Stoxx 600 Technology Index as much as 3.6% lower. The H20 restrictions are ‚Äúdriven by concerns over China‚Äôs rise in the electronics sector, and in that sense, it is likely to become a permanent policy,‚Äù said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. ‚ÄúIt is expected to have a significant negative impact on semiconductor supply chain.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs war on trade is prompting economists to scale back their forecasts for GDP growth worldwide, casting doubt over the outlook for everything from smart-phone demand to computing. Even before Washington slapped additional tariffs on much of the world ‚Äî only to roll them back shortly after ‚Äî many industry analysts had questioned whether big tech firms from Microsoft Corp. to Meta Platforms Inc. will continue to buy Nvidia Corp. chips at the same pace in 2025. Nvidia warned that it will report around $5.5 billion in related charges during the fiscal first quarter. Its shares slid about 5% in late US trading Tuesday. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 later extended losses to more than 2% after ASML‚Äôs report. Among key suppliers, Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. slumped as much as 3.9% Wednesday. Top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.9%. Japanese chip-equipment maker Advantest Corp. dropped as much as 7.8%, extending its fall after ASML‚Äôs statement. TSMC was already likely to slow some production expansion on a weaker economic outlook, and ‚Äúthe tighter rules on Nvidia‚Äôs China sales might amplify the deceleration,‚Äù Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Hui wrote in a note. For China, the broader restrictions raise concerns that access to global tech hardware will be further choked off. Exports of the most-advanced chips and equipment to the Asian nation are already banned, and the H20 is a scaled-down product specifically designed not to be too powerful. Even after DeepSeek raised hopes that advances can be made in artificial intelligence and other fields without the most cutting-edge chips, China‚Äôs tech giants may suffer if curbs keep getting extended. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. sank as much as 5.4% in Hong Kong trading Wednesday, while Baidu Inc. fell 3.3%. ‚ÄúIt is a reminder of the potential susceptibility of tech stocks to the ongoing prickly relationship between the US and China regarding semiconductors,‚Äù said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade in Sydney. ‚ÄúThere is a reliance on the H20 chip from big name players in the Asian tech space, so any moves which could impact supply will be a drag on the broader sector.‚Äù On the other side of the equation, China continues to work toward self-reliance in technology, though its companies are still seen lagging far behind advanced global leaders like Nvidia. Among Chinese hardware stocks bucking the regional sector declines Wednesday, Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd. jumped as much as 6.6% in Hong Kong while Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. rose 2.1% in Shanghai. ‚ÄúAI innovation in China is booming and the H20 ban would not dampen it ‚Äî it may accelerate the use of China domestic chips,‚Äù said Vey-Sern Ling, a managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. ‚ÄúDomestic AI chips may not perform as well as Nvidia‚Äôs H20, but that is missing the point.

2025-04-16 09:07:00,"Down 17%, Is It Time to Buy the Dip on Nvidia Stock?","Over the last few years,Nvidia(NVDA1.30%)has emerged as the leader of America's tech industry -- riding a tidal wave of demand for its cutting-edge chips used to train and run AI algorithms. However, with shares down 17% year to date, the company has hit a roadblock as a combination of trade uncertainty and possible foreign competition calls its growth thesis into question. Should investors buy the dip or stay far away from this technology leader? Let's dig deeper to find out. While it's easy to blame Nvidia's recent dip on the Trump administration's trade policy, that's only part of the story. Semiconductors are exempt from U.S. tariffs (although this could change in the future), and Nvidia has already made significant strides to onshore its supply chain -- even sourcing its latest Blackwell-basedgraphics processing units(GPUs) fromTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's new manufacturing facility in Arizona. The real problem started in January, with the launch of DeepSeek R1 -- a Chineselarge language model(LLM) that reportedly matched the performance of industry leaders like ChatGPT despite using less-advanced H800 chips. While there has been debate about DeepSeek training costs and possible intellectual property violations, it raises some alarming questions. Can cheaper alternatives replace Nvidia's most advanced GPUs? Will the high-cost American AI software industry be undermined by more affordable options in China and other parts of the world? It is still too early to have an answer to these questions, but the uncertainty clearly weighs on Nvidia's stock price, even though growth remains strong. While DeepSeek's full impact is yet to be seen, there is already evidence that Nvidia's clients are seeking to reduce their reliance on the company by turning to in-house hardware solutions. In February, OpenAI finalized an agreement with TSMC to develop its first generation of custom AI chips with plans to launch them in 2026. Custom chips are AI chips designed for a specific workload. This characteristic means they can operate with fewer unneeded components, making them more efficient than Nvidia's one-size-fits-all solutions. Perhaps more importantly, they allow clients to skip a costly middleman. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia's products aren't cheap. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company boasted a gross margin of 73.5%, which is surprisingly high for a hardware company. To put that number into perspective,software-as-a-service(SaaS) giantMicrosofthas a gross margin of 69%. Custom chips can allow customers to buy AI hardware for closer to their production cost. And OpenAI isn't the only major Nvidia client exploring this option.Alphabet,Amazon, andMeta Platformsalready make custom chips, whileTeslais working on Dojo D1, which is designed for its AI supercomputer. As a fabless chip designer (that doesn't actually manufacture its chips), Nvidia's business model is a target for competition from its high-tech rivals, who can also make deals with its manufacturing partner, TSMC. So far, Nvidia's potential challenges from DeepSeek and custom chips have had no noticeable impact on its operational results. Business is booming, with fourth-quarter revenue surging 78% year over year to $39.3 billion, driven by the successful rollout of the company's new Blackwell AI data center chips. Net income soared 80% to $22.1 billion. Against these stellar results, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 25 looks perplexingly cheap. That said, investors shouldn't rush to buy the stock until there is more clarity on these long-term challenges.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/16/down-17-is-it-time-to-buy-the-dip-on-nvidia/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=930eb329-d907-42c1-9e4c-ecb8f26d999f&.tsrc=rss,4

The number of researchers using Nvidia's CUDA and other software tools for improved GPU performance increased by 25% to 5.9 million last year. Companies are racing to build the most advanced AI infrastructure. The growth in AI spending more than doubled Nvidia's data center revenue last year, and it ended the year with strong momentum. Leadingcloud service providersdrive about half of Nvidia's data center revenue. It's seeing growing demand from regional cloud hosting providers as companies prepare to launch more advanced AI reasoning models. Agentic AI models that are able to reason and perform tasks without human input will require exponential increases in computing power.¬†This is driving high demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell platform.MicrosoftandAlphabet's Google were among the first to deploy Blackwell, which should fuel another year of strong growth for Nvidia. Nvidiais still in the process of helping data centers transition from traditional computing systems to accelerated computing for AI workloads. CEO Jensen Huang has said this is a $1 trillion opportunity, making Nvidia's recent 27% sell-off from recent highs a great opportunity to start a position. The Wall Street consensus projects Nvidia'searningsto grow 37% on an annualized basis in the coming years. ServiceNow's(NOW2.23%)workflow automation software is enabling the AI transformation for the world's largest corporations. More than 8,400 customers, including almost everyFortune 500company, use ServiceNow. This software innovator benefits from recurring subscription revenue and high renewal rates, making the stock a great buy after the recent dip. ServiceNow is estimated to control more than 40% of the global information technology software market. Several deep-pocketed competitors, including Microsoft, are vying for positions in this market, but they can't compete with ServiceNow's rapid deployment and integrations across leading cloud services. Revenue has consistently grown above 20% year over year for the past five years. Subscription revenue grew 21% in constant currency last year. It's a very profitable business, withfree cash flowincreasing to $3.3 billion last year on nearly $11 billion of revenue. Businesses are eager to adopt AI solutions to use with their data. ServiceNow's recent software releases are meeting this demand. More than 1,000 customers already use ServiceNow's latest agentic AI features through its Now Platform. With the stock trading 34% below its previous highs, it's a great buy ahead of a massive growth opportunity. ServiceNow estimates its long-term addressable market at $500 billion.This explains why Wall Street analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 33% in the coming years.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/16/2-growth-stocks-down-27-or-more-to-buy-right-now/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8b4eb781-7faf-42ce-b33b-c5e0308c94ec&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-16 09:38:00,Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than SoundHound AI 1 Year From Now,"SoundHound AI(SOUN0.86%), a developer of audio and speech recognition technologies, went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on April 28, 2022. Its stock started trading at $8.72 per share, and it rallied to an all-time high of $24.23 on Dec. 26, 2024, as its market capitalization reached nearly $9 billion. SoundHound initially impressed the bulls with its breakneck growth rates. Its revenue surged 47% in 2022, 47% in 2023, and 85% in 2024. That acceleration was driven by the growing usage of its Houndify platform to develop custom speech recognition tools, as well as its acquisitions of restaurant AI company Synq3, online food ordering platform Allset, and conversational AI company Amelia.Nvidia(NVDA1.30%)also bought more shares of SoundHound in early 2024, pumping up investor optimism. Image source: Getty Images. But today, SoundHound's stock trades at about $8. Its stock pulled back as investors fretted over its ongoing losses, cooling organic growth, and growing dependence on acquisitions. Its high valuations also made it an easy target for the bears as the Donald Trump's unpredictable tariffs drove investors toward safe haven plays again. Nvidia liquidated its entire stake in SoundHound earlier this year, and SoundHound delayed its 10-K filing for 2024 in March due to the ""complexity"" of its acquisitions of Synq3 and Amelia. Those setbacks caused its stock to plummet, but it doesn't look like a bargain yet. With a market cap of $3.28 billion, it still trades at 20 times this year's sales estimaes. Analysts expect its revenue to surge 96% in 2025, but a lot of that growth will come from its recent acquisitions. In 2026, they expect just 29% growth -- and it's expected to stay unprofitable for the foreseeable future. Therefore, I believe SoundHound's stock could either stagnate or slide lower over the next 12 months. So instead of buying SoundHound as a contarian play at these levels, investors should pay attention to two less valuable AI plays that ich might eclipse its market cap in a year:Innodata(INOD1.39%)andFive9(FIVN-0.17%).  SOUN Market Capdata byYCharts Innodata was once a tiny, slow-growth analytics software company that didn't attract much attention. But in 2018, it rolled out a suite of task-specific microservices aimed at preparing data forAI applications. When big tech companies develop a new AI project, they often spend 80% of their time preparing that data and the remaining 20% feeding it into the training algorithm. It makes sense to outsource all that time-consuming process to Innodata's microservices. As of this writing, five of the""Magnificent Seven""companies had already hired Innodata to clean up their AI data. From 2019 to 2024, Innodata's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%. In 2024, its revenue surged 95% and it turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. That growth spurt was driven by its new Magnificent Seven contracts and the rapid expansion of the generative AI market. Five9 operates a cloud-based contact center, which helps companies manage and optimize customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media, and mobile channels with AI-powered chatbots and human agents. Its customers can directly access those services or integrate them into their own apps with a few lines of code. It aims to disrupt traditional call centers with those streamlined services. From 2019 to 2024, Five9's revenue grew at a CAGR of 26%. It also significantly narrowed its GAAP net losses in 2023 and 2024. That growth was driven by the ongoing outsourcing and automation of customer service jobs to cut costs. With a market cap of $1.16 billion, Innodata trades at only 4.8 times this year's sales. Five9, which has a market cap of $1.75 billion, trades at 1.5 times this year's sales. From 2024 to 2026, analysts expect Innodata's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 31% as Five9's revenue increases at a CAGR of 10%. Innodata's business of cleaning up AI data might be better insulated from the macro headwinds than Five9, which could struggle to gain new customers during an economic downturn. But over the long term, Five9 should keep expanding as more companies automate their call centers and adopt its AI chatbots. Assuming Innodata matches analysts' estimates and trades at a more generous 12 times its forward sales by the beginning of 2026, its stock could more than triple to nearly $105 a share and boost its market cap to $3.51 billion. If Five9 meets Wall Street's expectations and commands a higher (but still reasonable) forwardprice-to-salesratio of 5 by the start of 2026, its stock price could nearly quadruple to around $82 and propel its market cap to $6.34 billion. Investors should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but both of these AI stocks have a shot at overtaking SoundHound AI over the next 12 months. I think they will. Meanwhile, SoundHound AI's stock could stall out and slide lower if it doesn't fix its most pressing issues.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/16/prediction-2-stocks-that-will-be-worth-more-than-s/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=bf5ea9c2-06f5-4f48-b2e5-bfe2ac7cc4a0&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-16 10:32:00,Should You Buy Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Stock Before May 6?,"Advanced Micro Devices(AMD0.85%)supplies some of the world's best semiconductors, including a growing portfolio of chips specifically designed to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in data centers and personal computers. AMD is scheduled to report its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on May 6. Investors can expect to learn more about the company's progress, and perhaps even receive an updated forecast from CEO Lisa Su regarding AI chip sales for 2025. The stock is currently trading 54% below its record high from 2024. Some of that downside occurred after April 2, when President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on America's trading partners. The stock is now at a very attractive valuation, so is this a good opportunity for investors to buy ahead of the May 6 report? Image source: Getty Images. AMD launched its MI300X AI graphics processing unit(GPU)for the data center in late 2023. It quickly won over several top AI developers likeMeta Platforms,Microsoft, andOracle, some of which yielded better performance and lower costs compared to usingNvidia's H100 (which was leading the industry at the time). AMD has since launched the more powerful MI325X, and it's gearing up to start shipping a brand new lineup called the MI350 series, which is based on a fresh GPU architecture called CDNA (Compute DNA) 4. This architecture offers an eye-popping performance increase of 35 times compared to CDNA 3 chips like the MI300X. It will rivalNvidia's Blackwell architecture, which is currently the benchmark for the industry. The company started sending MI350 samples to customers during the first quarter of 2025, with production expected to ramp up into the middle of the year. It's likely to be AMD's most popular lineup of data center GPUs so far, because their increased processing power could pave the way for some of the most advancedAI modelsdeveloped to date. In fact, Oracle recently announced plans to build a cluster of 30,000 of the upcoming MI355X GPUs, which might be a sign of things to come from other customers. Investors are likely to receive an update on the production and demand picture when AMD reports its first-quarter financial results on May 6. AMD generated $25.8 billion in totalrevenueduring 2024, which was a 14% increase from the prior year. However, the company's data center revenue soared by 94% to reach a record high of $12.6 billion. GPU sales alone accounted for $5 billion of that total, and Su predicts that this figure will scale into the tens of billions of dollars over the next few years. Investors should keep an eye out for an update on that forecast on May 6, especially now that many customers have sampled the MI350 series GPUs over the last few months. AMD also generated $7 billion in revenue in its client segment, which was a 52% year-over-year jump. This business unit is home to the company's Ryzen AI chips for personal computers, which enable powerful chatbots and other AI applications to run locally on-device. This creates a much faster user experience, and it means you can use the power of AI without an internet connection in some cases. The chipmaker's other two segments, gaming and embedded, didn't fare so well during 2024, which is partly why its stock has lost so much ground. Gaming revenue declined by 58%, but a recovery might be underway. The company recently released the hotly anticipated Radeon 9070 GPU, which many customers were waiting to buy. Revenue from the embedded segment, on the other hand, sank by 33% due to weak demand in primary markets like communications and industrials. Simply put, if AMD can return the gaming and embedded segments to growth in 2025 (as is expected), while continuing to deliver powerful growth in its AI businesses, the company could be in for a record year in 2025. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. Like Nvidia and many other industry heavyweights, AMD relies onTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingto fabricate a significant portion of its chips. Earlier this month, President Trumpimposed a 10% tariffon all goods imported into the U.S., in addition to another ""reciprocal"" tariff of 32% on Taiwan specifically (which was recently paused for 90 days). The president exempted semiconductors from these penalties, but they will still affect many of AMD's customers, which could force them to reduce their AI infrastructure budgets. As a result, it's possible that Su will not increase her 2025 sales forecast for GPUs when AMD reports its first-quarter results on May 6, which is a key risk to the stock. Nevertheless, President Trump has pulled this policy lever before. He imposed a series oftariffson America's trading partners in 2018, which contributed to a near-20% decline in theS&P 500. But as we now know, the market -- and the broader economy -- recovered just fine in the years that followed. On that note, it might be a good idea to set May 6 aside and focus on AMD's long-term potential, especially given its current stock price. It trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 28.2, which is a 31% discount to Nvidia's P/E ratio of 37.1. Moreover, based on Wall Street's average earnings-per-share forecast of $4.65 for 2025 (provided by Yahoo! Finance), AMD stock trades at aforward P/E ratioof just 20.1. In other words, the stock would have to climb by 40% by the end of this year just to maintain its current P/E ratio. There could be some volatility surrounding AMD's upcoming financial report on May 6, depending on what Su tells investors about AI demand. However, investors could do well if they buy the stock at the current price regardless, as long as they can maintain a long-term horizon of three to five years.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/16/should-buy-advanced-micro-devices-amd-stock-may-6/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=207a9038-b947-4528-afae-80ab1d2d6578&.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-16 10:35:23,"Nasdaq futures, Nvidia slide after new US curbs on chip exports to China","By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Purvi Agarwal (Reuters) -Nasdaq futures led declines on Wednesday and AI-chip heavyweight Nvidia slumped after it flagged steep charges from new U.S. curbs on semiconductor exports to China, the latest flashpoint in trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. The U.S. Commerce Department late on Tuesday issued new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial-intelligence chips to China. Nvidia said it faces $5.5 billion in charges after the restrictions on exports to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips. Shares of Nvidia slumped 6.4% in premarket trading, while AMD shares lost 6.8%. Other chip stocks also lost ground, with Micron Technology down 4% and Broadcom falling 3.9%. The export controls are the newest attempt from the administration of President Donald Trump to keep advanced semiconductors from being sold to China. Nvidia's warning highlighted the impact of the trade tensions on businesses and fueled worries that the constant shifts in U.S. trade policy would hit domestic consumption and economic growth. Investors are now hawk-eyed about the outlook from companies this earnings season. ""The trade escalation continues at full speed. (In response) China could well restrict its exports of rare earth metals and other commodities essential to building chips and machines to the U.S.,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. Ozkardeskaya said that the latest Chinese economic data was broadly positive and that ""the stronger the Chinese data, the less likely it is to bend to U.S. demands"". Those worries have also led to sharp volatility in financial markets, with all three major Wall Street indexes losing ground so far this year. The CBOE volatility index, Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" ticked up 1.46 points to 31.58 after falling for the last three sessions. Separately, Trump ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on all critical minerals imports. At 07:12 a.m., Dow E-minis were down 35 points, or 0.09%, S&P 500 E-minis were down 43.25 points, or 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 285.25 points, or 1.5% Investors will closely monitor a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later in the day for indications on how the central bank will respond to the market's volatility, coupled with growth worries. Traders see a 20% chance that the Fed will ease rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting, according to CME's FedWatch. March retail sales, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, will also be scrutinized for clues on how consumers are faring amid uncertainty and rising inflation expectations. Corporate results are now in focus, with many financial institutions set to report results before markets open. United Airlines rose 6.4% after the company reported stable bookings despite forecasting lower profit for the current quarter and flagging risks if the U.S. economy slips into a recession. Tesla fell 2.2% after Reuters reported that Trump's tariffs on Chinese parts had disrupted the EV-maker's production plans.

2025-04-16 10:50:00,Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Beat the Market. Here's Why.,"The scramble to build compute capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) models and training has enriched longtimeNvidia(NVDA1.30%)shareholders. Large tech companies have been sharply increasing capital spending to build data centers and fill them with powerful servers, largely using Nvidia's products. Retail investors andhedge fund managersalike piled into Nvidia shares over the past few years. The stock rocketed more than 400% over the last three years, even with it hovering about 25% off its record-high level. I believe the AI leader will continue to beat the market going forward. Here are some reasons why. Early use cases for AI have ranged fromchatbots for internet searchesand customer service to AI agents providing specialized services. Increasingly, businesses will be using the powerful technology to improve efficiency, target lucrative markets, and grow sales. Manufacturers can reduce defective products, increase productivity, and save maintenance costs using AI. Nvidia andAlphabet's Google Cloud just announced a collaboration to bring agentic AI to enterprises that are aiming to have AI make decisions and perform tasks autonomously. It will use Nvidia's latest Blackwell platform on Google Distributed Cloud to effectively create on-site data centers. Educators are also increasingly relying on AI to aid in teaching as well as research. Nvidia was targeting that segment with the release of its first desktop AI supercomputer last year. The company announced development of a compact desktop computer geared toward developers, researchers, and students. Nvidia has also launched desktop AI machines ""to help marketers and other professionals leverage AI in their daily tasks,"" the company says. Robots powered by AIalong with driver assistance and self-driving software could well drive another major growth spurt for Nvidia. The company is already realizing sharply growing sales in its automotive and robotics segment. Automotive and robotics fiscal quarterly revenue. Data source: Nvidia. Chart by author. Fourth-quarter revenue more than doubled year over year, and the segment contributed $1.7 billion to Nvidia's sales last fiscal year. Nvidia has business partnerships with multiple global automakers.Toyotaplans to build its next-generation vehicles using Nvidia's software-defined platform for autonomous vehicles, for example. Vehicle makers are including advanced driving assistance capabilities, and Nvidia will be one big beneficiary. Similarly, companies will utilize intelligent machines and robots increasingly across industries, including manufacturing, healthcare and logistics. There's another important factor that can help Nvidia beat the market from here: The stock's valuation has become very compelling, as shares have dropped 17.4% this year, as of this writing. The once high-flying stock now sports aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratiobelow 25 based on the current fiscal year's earnings estimates. Nvidia's business is also somewhat insulated from potential cost increases that could come from Trump administration tariff policies and the U.S. trade war with China. Nvidia's gross profit margin increased 230basis pointslast year to 75%. While investors may avoid the stock in the short term if profit margins deteriorate, the company is starting from a very strong position in that area. No investor can know what will come in the currently turbulent geopolitical environment. A general flight to safety could push stocks down further from recent levels if investors shun stocks in general. In the end, though, a growing business with strong profitability like Nvidia's will ultimately bean attractive place to investfor the long term.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/16/prediction-nvidia-will-beat-the-market-ai/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=c4a336e5-9881-456a-8dd8-60972fb553ce&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-16 11:00:08,Telus stakes claim in Canada's AI race with plans for Nvidia-powered data centres,"Telus Communications Inc.has announced plans to build a pair of data centres powered by leading-edgeNvidia Corp.chips as the Vancouver-based telecom seeks to establish itself as a key player in Canada‚Äôsartificial intelligenceinfrastructure buildout. This summer, Telus will launch an AI-focused data centre in Rimouski, Que., that will include a 10,000-square-foot server module equipped with up to 500 Hopper graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. Telus plans to deploy the latest Blackwell Nvidia GPUs ‚Äî which are used for advanced AI workloads and compute-intensive tasks ‚Äî sometime next year. The Rimouski facility ‚Äî which it is calling a ‚ÄúSovereign AI factory‚Äù ‚Äî has the capacity for six additional server modules. The company will open another facility in Kamloops, B.C., once the compute capacity in Rimouski has been utilized; it does not have a fixed launch date for its B.C. data centre. Company spokesperson Athyu Eleti said that the Kamloops factory is an existing facility that will require ‚Äúminimal retrofitting‚Äù to accommodate the AI operations, allowing them to quickly bring it up to speed when needed. Telus, the first Canadian telecoms player to take a crack at Canada‚Äôs AI compute market, declined to disclose how much it has invested in its AI data centres. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huangtold CNBClast year that Blackwell GPUs could cost between US$30,000 to US$40,000 per unit, while Hopper chips are priced around US$25,000 to US$30,000, according to analyst estimates. Telus also said it is the first North American service provider to become an official Nvidia ‚Äúcloud partner‚Äù ‚Äî a deal that was announced last month and allows the telecom to integrate Nvidia GPUs and AI software to enable powerful and advanced AI model training and inference capabilities, Eleti said. Telus‚Äô AI data centre clients include Canadian businesses, startups and researchers looking to develop smarter AI products and streamline operations. The company‚Äôs AI data centre announcements come as technology groups and business leaders urge the next government to increase investment in and adoption of AI across the country, and as the AI race heats up worldwide. The federal government last year launched a $2 billion Sovereign AI Compute Strategy that aims to boostdomestic computing powerfor homegrown companies, startups and researchers. U.S. President Donald Trump has called on White House officials to develop anew AI Action Plan by Julyto ensure and maintain U.S. AI dominance. Meanwhile, U.S. tech giants are locked in a race to build the industry‚Äôs biggest AI data centres, from OpenAI Inc. and Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs US$100 billion Stargate project to Amazon Web Services‚Äô Project Rainier that is also expected to hit a US$100 billion budget.

The news, thelatest salvoin an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing, sent the firm's shares tumbling roughly 6% in premarket trading Wednesday. The company said in a regulatory filing late Tuesday that it was informed by the U.S. government on April 9 that it would be required to have an export license ""for the indefinite future"" to sell itsH20 chipsto China. Nvidia said the license requirement is aimed at addressing the risk that the chip would be ""used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China."" The chip is less powerful than its newer ones andtailoredto meet existing export limits for the Chinese market.

2025-04-16 11:36:33,Morning Bid: US-China trade war goes full throttle,"By Mike Dolan LONDON (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and global markets today By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Financial Industry and Financial Markets The escalating U.S.-China trade war has expanded and moved beyond tariffs, now hitting everything from chips to planes and pharma. The tensions upended the week's fragile market stability while hitting the dollar again and spurring gold to new records. Speaking of gold, in today's column, I explore the rush for the precious metal this year and let you know which country has been dramatically ramping up imports. Now onto the market news. Today's Market Minute * Shares fell in Asia on Wednesday as AI darling Nvidia took a hit from U.S. curbs on chip sales to China, highlighting the damage to come in a tit-for-tat global trade war, while gold hit a record and the safe-haven currencies jumped. * Nvidia did not warn at least some major customers in advance about new U.S. export rules it was told about a week ago requiring it to obtain licenses to sell its China-focused artificial intelligence chip, according to two sources familiar with the matter. * China's first-quarter economic growth outstripped expectations, underpinned by solid consumption and industrial output, but analysts fear momentum could shift sharply lower given the risk posed by U.S. tariffs. * Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bid to transform India into a global factory floor has produced billions of dollars of low-cost iPhones and pharmaceuticals. Now he hopes to add missiles, helicopters and battleships to the shopping carts of foreign governments. * U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status on Tuesday and said the university should apologize, a day after it rejected what it called unlawful demands to overhaul academic programs or lose federal grants. US-China trade war goes full throttle Investors fearful of facing endless more months of trade war-induced uncertainty were given a litany of new concerns overnight, while they also braced for a wave of retail and industrial reports and corporate earnings outlooks on Wednesday. Shares in chip giant Nvidia plunged 6% in after hours trading on news that the firm is facing a $5.5 billion charge related to its most advanced chip available for sale in China. Washington issued new export licensing requirements for both its H20 artificial intelligence chip and AMD's's MI308 chip. In addition, Trump ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on all U.S. critical minerals imports, on top of reviews into pharmaceutical and chip imports. Emboldened by surprisingly brisk GDP growth numbers for the first quarter, Beijing is continuing to play hardball in the expanding conflict, reportedly ordering airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing aircraft. Hongkong Post said it had suspended goods mail services by sea to the United States and will suspend its air mail postal service for items containing goods from April 27 due to ""bullying"" U.S. tariffs. And Tesla's plans to ship components from China for Cybercab and Semi electric trucks in the United States were suspended after the U.S.-China tariff spiral potentially disrupted the electric vehicle firm's plan to start mass production of the much-anticipated models. Wall Street stock index futures were down again about 1% ahead of Wednesday's bell after closing marginally in the red on Tuesday. Gold, now up 26% for the year so far, topped $3,300 per ounce for the first time. And the dollar suffered a relapse, with the yen and sterling hitting six-month highs. Strengthening in the euro and Canadian dollar was likely held back by expectations of near-term policy easing. The European Central Bank could cut interest rates again as soon as Thursday, and the Bank of Canada is on deck later today. Both meetings were preceded by soft inflation numbers that clear the way for easing. Stocks around the world were in the red again on Wednesday, with European bourses hit by trade-related chip woes as ASML fell more than 6% following a warning that tariffs would hit its business this year. Only China's mainland shares were higher. Wall Street now braces for another busy day ahead with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaking in Chicago and retail and industrial numbers for March coming out alongside another sweep of company earnings. U.S. banks were a bright spot on Tuesday as their Q1 updates showed their trading operations benefitted from market turbulence in the first three months. Finally, check out my column today, where I explore the drivers of gold's record run this year, including evidence of China's rapid accumulation of the precious metal as Beijing continues reshaping its foreign reserves. Chart of the day China's first quarter economic growth beat expectations, with a year-on-year GDP rise of 5.4%, matching the prior three months and topping consensus forecasts for a 5.1% expansion. The numbers likely reflect some feverish activity ahead of the U.S. tariff squeeze, with March retail and industrial numbers also beating estimates. The surge in exports last month is expected to tail off sharply in the months ahead. The country's property downturn also remained a drag, with investment in the sector falling 9.9% year-on-year in the first three months and new home prices flat in March. GDP forecasts for the full year anticipate growth slowing to a relatively subdued 4.5%. Today's events to watch * U.S. March retail sales, industrial production, February business/retail inventories, April NAB housing market index, February TIC data on foreign Treasury flows * Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks in Chicago; Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and Kansas City Fed chief Jeffrey Schmid both speak * Bank of Canada policy decision, press conference from Governor Tiff Macklem * World Trade Organisation releases global trade outlook 2025 * U.S. corporate earnings: US Bancorp, Citizens Financial, Travelers, CSX, Progressive, Abbott Laboratories, Prologis, Kinder Morgan etc * U.S. Treasury sells $13 billion of 20-year bonds * German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meets Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said that while ASML had maintained guidance for 2025, ""that in itself is also a slight concern as it is a very wide forecast and could result in a number of different growth rates. AI demand remains strong, but the uncertainty around tariffs is driving much of the conservative nature of management. ""The share price has derated of late and given this uncertainty this is understandable, but with the guidance in place it is difficult to assess if ASML looks cheap or expensive right now."" Shares in Netflix (NFLX) rose nearly 5% in Tuesday's session, after theWall Street Journal reportedon Monday that the streaming giant is aiming to achieve a $1tn market capitalisation and double revenue by 2030.

This came after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that China had ordered its airlines to stop taking new deliveries of Boeing jets, which was considered to another move in escalating US-China trade tensions. Jim Reid, market strategist at Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE), said that ""while there had been optimism after the weekend news on tariff exemptions for electronics, there‚Äôs been no sign since of either the US or China backing down.""

About Decoy‚Äôs Peptide Conjugate Technology Decoy‚Äôs drug design engine uses the power of computational tools and fast peptide synthesis technology pioneered in the laboratory of Brad Pentelute, Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry at MIT and Decoy co-founder, to rapidly engineer and synthesize novel antivirals that directly target highly conserved viral machinery. Its proprietary IMP3ACT peptide conjugate drug design and manufacturing platform leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tools. IMP3ACT allows for the rapid computational design and manufacturing of innovative peptide-conjugate therapeutics including rapid response to novel viral pathogens including H5N1 avian flu. Peptide conjugates are a new class of drug, perhaps best known for the popular diabetes and weight loss medications, that takes advantage of the strong activity and selectivity of peptides, and improves their targeting and durability by adding a lipid molecule. Decoy Therapeutics is expanding the use of this new drug class to indications including infectious diseases and cancer. The IMP3ACT platform leverages peptide chemistry to design a-helical peptides using computational and machine learning tools. These peptides are transformed into multimeric conjugates by chemically linking a defined number of copies to lipids or other suitable membrane anchor moieties, enhancing their drug-like properties and dosing flexibility with extended pharmacokinetics. Decoy‚Äôs technology has produced peptide conjugates effective in vitro against multiple human coronaviruses, including all SARS-CoV-2 major variants of concern to date, and against RSV A, RSV B and hPIV3, and in vivo against the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. By integrating machine learning algorithms in peptide design and synthesis, Decoy‚Äôs platform accelerates the creation of lead molecules for preclinical evaluations, simultaneously optimizing peptide conjugates for enhanced affinity, binding specificity, resistance to proteases, pharmacokinetic properties and manufacturability at early commercial scale. About Decoy Therapeutics, Inc. Decoy Therapeutics is a preclinical-stage biotechnology company that is leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence tools alongside high-speed synthesis techniques to rapidly design, engineer and manufacture peptide-conjugate drug candidates that target serious unmet medical needs.

2025-04-16 12:05:16,Global chip stocks slide as Nvidia warns of big hit from U.S. export curbs,"(Reuters) - Global chip stocks slumped on Wednesday after Washington curbed exports of an AI chip Nvidia had tailored for China, further cutting off the crucial growth market for semiconductors in a move that will cost the AI pioneer $5.5 billion in charges. Nvidia said the charges it would incur is a result of U.S. restricting the export of its H20 AI chip to China, along with AMD's MI308 and their equivalents. The export curbs to China have in recent years squeezed U.S. companies, but the country remains a crucial revenue source with Nvidia drawing more than 13% of its sales, or some $17 billion, from China in its last fiscal year. Meanwhile, ASML, the world's biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment, cautioned that tariffs were adding to the uncertainty for its outlook for 2025 and 2026, sending its shares down over 4%. ""We are not surprised that there are limits to H20...but the constraint there is supply, so a more sudden reduction in H20 - and given the inventory writedown, a higher revenue expectation going forward for H20 - will likely be disruptive to revenue and earnings,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said. Shares of Nvidia were down 5%, AMD dropped over 6%, while Micron Technology, Broadcom and Intel fell between 2% to 4% in premarket trading. Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst, said banning the H20 Chip 'makes no sense' as it would hand over the Chinese AI market to rivals Huawei. U.S. officials have been aiming to prevent the sale of critical chip to China in an effort to maintain a competitive edge in the AI race. ""The impact of a full H20 wipeout is probably (about)30 cents or so at current levels (not enormous in the grand scheme of things),"" Rasgon said.

2025-04-16 12:12:16,"China Open to Talks If US Shows Respect, Names Point Person","(Bloomberg) -- China wants to see a number of steps from President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration before it will agree to trade talks, including showing more respect by reining in disparaging remarks by members of his cabinet, according to a person familiar with the Chinese government‚Äôs thinking. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs Other conditions include a more consistent US position and a willingness to address China‚Äôs concerns around American sanctions and Taiwan, said the person, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal thinking. Follow the The Big Take daily podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. Beijing also wants the US to appoint a point person for talks who has the president‚Äôs support and can help prepare a deal that Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping can sign when they meet, the person said. The fate of the global economy and financial markets hinges in large part on whether the US and China can find a way to avoid a protracted trade war. Trump has hit China with tariffs of 145% on most goods since taking office, prompting Beijing to retaliate and threatening to wipe out most trade between the world‚Äôs biggest economies. The offshore yuan gained 0.2% against the dollar in the wake of the report. The Australian dollar, a China-proxy currency, also advanced 0.5%. S&P 500 Index futures pared losses from as much as 1.6% earlier in the session. The rapid onslaught of US tariffs has engendered broad public support in China for retaliation, giving Xi a political incentive to rebuff Trump‚Äôs repeated demands for a phone call. The US leader on Tuesday again called on China to reach out to him in order to kick off negotiations to resolve the trade fight. It‚Äôs unclear what will produce a breakthrough to get talks moving. While both sides have indicated they‚Äôre open to negotiations, Trump appears determined to get Xi on the phone straight away while China wants any conversation between the leaders to produce a clear outcome. Even then if they agree on process, fundamental questions persist on what any agreement would look like. Trump‚Äôs demands remain unclear, and tariff levels on China would need to remain high to achieve his goal of balancing trade and attracting manufacturers to the US. ‚ÄòDifficult‚Äô Road Ahead While both China and the US probably want to see tariff rates lowered due to domestic pressure, negotiations are ‚Äúunlikely to lead to a meaningful deescalation,‚Äù said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA. ‚ÄúThere is a bit more clarity on what China is looking from: respect, consistency and a point person,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo now the ball is in US court on whether they can meet these demands. But that is still difficult ‚Äî especially if the aim is to contain China‚Äôs rise.‚Äù According to the person familiar with Beijing‚Äôs thinking, the most important precondition for any talks is that Chinese officials need to know such engagement will be conducted with respect. While the president has been relatively dovish when speaking publicly about Xi, other members of his administration have been more hawkish, leaving officials in Beijing unsure of the US‚Äôs position, the person said. Whatever the situation in Trump‚Äôs first term, officials in Beijing believe he now has tremendous control over this administration, said the person. As a result, when US officials make pointed statements about China, and Trump doesn‚Äôt disavow those views, Chinese officials have assumed the president condones their positions, the person said. Vance Comments While the person didn‚Äôt identify any specific comments by administration officials, Beijing has recently expressed notable displeasure with comments Vice President JD Vance made about ‚ÄúChinese peasants.‚Äù Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian last week called the remarks ‚Äúignorant and disrespectful,‚Äù in what was a rare direct rebuke of a senior US leader. In addition to wanting a consistent message from the US administration, officials in Beijing also want to know that Washington is ready to address some of China‚Äôs concerns, the person said. Chief among those is the prevailing perception among Chinese officials that the US has enacted policies designed to contain and suppress China‚Äôs modernization. The US in recent years has tightened export controls around China in an effort to prevent Beijing from obtaining cutting-edge chips and other advanced technology. Trump‚Äôs administration on Monday barred Nvidia Corp. from selling its H20 chip in China, escalating the tech fight with Beijing. Point Person China also wants the US to address its national security concerns, particularly over Taiwan, the person said. Beijing claims the self-governing island as part of its territory and has pledged to take steps, including military action if necessary, to protect those claims. China will not undertake any provocative actions on Taiwan, the person said, but it will respond if provoked. Finally, Beijing also wants the US to designate a point person to oversee talks, the person said. China has no preference for who that is but they want the person to clearly be speaking and acting with Trump‚Äôs authority. Chinese officials also understand that Trump may want to personally lead the negotiations, the person said. While Beijing would be flattered by Trump wanting to invest his time to such discussions, the person said, China believes the best way forward is for officials designated by the two presidents to oversee the talks. That would be the most-effective way to ensure that negotiations culminated in a meaningful summit between Trump and Xi, the person said. --With assistance from Wenjin Lv and Fran Wang.

2025-04-16 13:00:36,Nvidia warns on $5.5B loss from China chip crackdown,"You can catch Opening Bid onApple Podcasts,Spotify,YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. So much for the mini relief rally in one of the world‚Äôs most popular stocks. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell as much as 5% in early trading on Wednesday as the company said it would take a $5.5 billion charge as the Trump administration barred it from selling its H20 AI chip in China. The news came a day after Nvidia tossed the Trump administration a big bone in committing to spend $500 billion over four years to manufacture AI supercomputers in the US. Nvidia‚Äôs whopping charge and the subsequent negative reaction in the stock should remind investors of at least two things. One, the US and China remain far apart in a trade deal ‚Äì and in the meantime, escalations along the lines of the Nvidia chip news should be expected. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a deal with China hasn't yettaken form in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. Talks between the two haven‚Äôt commenced, Bessent suggested. And two, as it pertains to Nvidia, in this environment, investors should assume bad news isn‚Äôt baked into the stock price. The fact that Nvidia‚Äôs stock price is being hit on news pros say had been expected says a lot about ongoing market uncertainty amid the trade war. Let's get one minute on the shot clock here. Locked and loaded. Stock of the day is, in fact, no drama, or maybe some drama. It is Nvidia. Uh, we're seeing shares under pressure here. Nvidia saying it's taking a $5.5 billion charge, uh, as the Trump administration barred it, or put restrictions on it, from selling its powerful AI H20 or H20 AI chip in China. So the stock under pressure there as well. Interesting that many on the street that I have talked to have expected this news coming. Still, shares are down. I think this, uh, this news provides two warnings for investors. First, uh, that China and US remain very far apart in terms of reaching a trade deal. That is something that was I was reminded of sitting right across Treasury Secretary Scott Besen, uh, in an interview on Tuesday. You can go to Yahoo Finance and check that out. They haven't even begun talks yet to get a deal done. And that comes with, uh, of course, risks risks to companies that sell stuff in China, such as Nvidia. And last, but not least, I mentioned even though this news was expected by the street, still, uh, to see the stock decline, I think in this environment, the reminder is that maybe nothing, uh, not all bad news is priced into a stock, especially a market leader like Nvidia.

2025-04-16 13:05:44,Nvidia to Record $5.5B Charge as US Cracks Down on Chip Exports to China,"Nvidia (NVDA) said it expects to take a $5.5 billion charge in its fiscal 2026 first-quarter results after the U.S. limited exports of itsartificial intelligence (AI)chips to China. The news, thelatest salvoin an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing, sent the firm's shares tumbling roughly 6% in premarket trading Wednesday. The company said in a regulatory filing late Tuesday that it was informed by the U.S. government on April 9 that it would be required to have an export license ""for the indefinite future"" to sell itsH20 chipsto China. Nvidia said the license requirement is aimed at addressing the risk that the chip would be ""used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China."" The chip is less powerful than its newer ones andtailoredto meet existing export limits for the Chinese market. Nvidia's Q1 results, which are expected May 28, are set to include the $5.5 billion charge ""associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves,"" it said.According toMorningstar Research, ""China has shrunk to about 10% of Nvidia's revenue from 20%, and we now expect it to go to close to zero.""

2025-04-16 13:15:30,Forbes Recession Tracker: Bank Of America Survey Finds Investors‚Äô Economic Growth Expectations At 3-Decade Low,"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline Fears of a sharp economic downturn due to President Donald Trump‚Äôs ever-changing tariff policies are pervading Wall Street, as some of the most trusted observers of the economy say the U.S. is far from able to declare victory on a tariff-driven recession. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, economic forecasts have been a rollercoaster.Getty Images  Key Facts   Some 42% of big money managers now expect as of April‚Äîthe fourth-highest monthly reading of the last two decades for the April fund manager survey, which also found the 82% of respondents expect weaker global economic growth, the highest reading in 30 years; the closely watched poll was conducted among 195 managers of an aggregate $444 billion assets under management April 4-10, the week after Trump announced his country-by-country tariffs.    Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday his bank‚Äôs baseline economic forecast does not call for a recession this year, but other big banks‚Äô economic models still indicate the chance of a recession this year remains a tossup: Morgan Stanley forecasts 40% odds, Goldman Sachs places 45% likelihood of a recession over the next year and JPMorgan Chase projects a 60% chance.    National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business' on Monday he is ‚Äú100% not‚Äù expecting a recession in 2025, explaining recent discussions with CEOs indicated the ‚Äúuncertainty over tariffs‚Äù won‚Äôt be ‚Äúa big drag‚Äù on the economy.    Though the Trump administration‚Äôs backdown last week from its most aggressive tariffs alleviated concerns the U.S. was on the cusp of a recession, Hassett‚Äôs confidence is far from a consensus view among Wall Street bigwigs and prominent economists.   Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said in a Sunday interview with NBC News: ‚ÄúRight now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession, and I‚Äôm worried about something worse than a recession if this isn‚Äôt handled well.‚Äù   Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary during President Bill Clinton‚Äôs term, said in a Monday editorial podcast in The New York Times he believes it‚Äôs ‚Äúsix in 10 or better that a recession will start this year,‚Äù explaining: ‚ÄúThe pause is certainly better than if we had simply charged along on the catastrophic path that we‚Äôre on, but anybody who thinks the genie is back in the bottle and that it‚Äôs all now OK should reconsider their position.‚Äù   Last week, Summers predicted such a downturn would leave an additional 2 million Americans unemployed, a more than 28% increase from the 7.1 million unemployed Americans in March, and a $5,000 or greater decline in annual household income.   Moody's Analytics Mark Zandi said Monday on ‚ÄúCNN News Central‚Äù he sees the U.S. sinking into a recession over the next ‚Äúthree, four‚Äù weeks if the policy uncertainty is still ‚Äúvery thick,‚Äù saying he hopes ‚Äúthe president and the administration kind of finds an off ramp here and the trade war de-escalates.‚Äù     Crucial Quote ‚ÄúThe prospect of a recession has increased,‚Äù Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a Monday earnings call. ‚ÄúOur clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors are concerned by the significant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions,‚Äù continued Solomon. News Peg Corporate earnings season is underway, which should better reveal the health of the economy during the first three months of 2025. United Airlines took a rarely seen step this week of issuing a pair of profit forecasts, one in the case of a recession, and one in the case of more stable growth. ‚ÄúA single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the Company‚Äôs expectation has become bimodal ‚Äì either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession,‚Äù the company wrote in a regulatory filing.  Jamie Dimon‚Äôs Recession Warnings Influenced Trump‚Äôs Pause In a Wednesday morning interview just hours before Trump paused many of the more than 10% country-by-country levies, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told ‚ÄúMornings With Maria‚Äù he believed a tariff-spurred recession is ‚Äúprobably‚Äù a ‚Äúlikely outcome,‚Äù adding he‚Äôs heard ‚Äúrecessionary talk‚Äù in conversations with other business leaders. Trump said the comments from Dimon, the head of the nation‚Äôs largest bank by assets and market value, partially inspired his pause. Economists at JPMorgan had labeled Trump‚Äôs policies as the ‚Äúlargest tax increase‚Äù since 1968 which will ‚Äúfall heavily on the US consumer.‚Äù In JPMorgan‚Äôs earnings call Friday, Dimon repeated his pushback against Trump‚Äôs targeting of allies in his trade war, explaining the ‚Äúmost important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically.‚Äù Stock Market Signals Slowdown Fears Stock prices don‚Äôt completely correlate with economic growth, but equity investors are clearly pricing still in significantly increased odds of a down stretch for the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 briefly dove into a 20% bear market last week, wiping out about $10 trillion in market value, led by stocks considered the most vulnerable to a slowdown, including artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla. But markets are still pricing ‚Äúnowhere close to the worst case‚Äù scenario, Bhanu Baweja, UBS Investment Bank‚Äôs chief strategist, said last Monday. Even after the post-pause recovery, the S&P is still down 12% from its February peak. Trump Administration Prepared Americans For The Possibility Of A Recession Ahead of the ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù announcement last week, Trump braced Americans for a possible recession. In a Fox News interview aired March 9, he would not rule out the possibility of a recession, cautioning Americans for a period of economic ‚Äútransition‚Äù as his policies take hold and noting he‚Äôs paying little attention to stock market losses. In subsequent media appearances, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent similarly declined to dismiss a potential recession and said the U.S. will go through a ‚Äúdetox period.‚Äù Bessent told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù in an interview he believes it ‚Äúwould have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes‚Äù on ahead of the Great Recession. ‚ÄúBe Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!,‚Äù Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Monday. What Needs To Happen To Gdp To Trigger A Recession (it‚Äôs Not Negative‚Äîyet) The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, a comprehensive measure of all goods and services produced in a country. The official quarterly GDP stats haven't turned negative yet, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve's real-time model ignited concerns by calling for -1.8% annual GDP growth in 2025's first quarter, which would be the worst reading since 2020‚Äîthough the estimate is likely skewed by its methodology, including how it accounts for a surge in gold imports.  Bond Market Is Shaky‚Äîbut Yield Curve‚Äôs Still Intact Elsewhere in financial markets, a flight to government-issued debt is evidence of a thirst for safer returns in the face of a potential recession, as yields for benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds have dropped by 40 basis points over the past three months (lower yields mean bonds got more valuable). But the most common bond market signal of a recession, the inversion of the yield curve, in which longer-term bonds have lower yields than shorter-dated ones, has actually normalized in recent months. The New York Fed‚Äôs bond-linked recession model calls for just 30% recession odds over the next year, down from the more than 70% odds in late 2023, a period which failed to materialize into a full-blown recession. Consumer Confidence Signals Americans Bracing For Tough Times Perhaps the most concerning signal over the last is a breakdown in everyday Americans‚Äô conviction in the economy, as the Conference Board‚Äôs closely watched consumer confidence survey tumbled this month to its lowest level since 2021. That tracks with weaker spending, as February retail sales grew by just 0.2% from January to February, according to a report released March 17 by the Census Bureau, far worse than the 0.6% month-over-month increase projected by economists. Unemployment Rate Is Still Fine One of the most important hallmarks of the American economy, the labor market has shown some cracks in early 2025 as job creation slowed and layoffs spiked, but remains overwhelmingly strong, as March‚Äôs 4.2% unemployment rate sits well within the healthy historic norm. A key labor market recession indicator, the Sahm rule, flashes a far lower likelihood of a recession than it did when it peaked last summer, inspiring a short-lived market selloff in August. Gold And Oil Prices Hint At Potential Global Slowdown Trading in two of the world‚Äôs most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 10% this year to a record $3,200 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. What To Watch For Bessent and Trump have made clear they are lasered in on lowering interest rates, which are determined by the politically independent Fed. Typically, rates are only drastically cut during periods of economic distress, as lower rates typically stimulate economic growth as households and businesses are more likely to borrow with lower interest costs, though that uptick in loan activity can simultaneously lead to higher inflation as demand rises. The Fed is likely to hold off on further rate cuts ‚Äúuntil tariff policy becomes clearer,‚Äù according to David Mericle, Goldman‚Äôs chief U.S. economist.

2025-04-16 13:16:35,Nvidia‚Äôs $5.5B Write-Down Isn‚Äôt a Death Knell ‚Äî It‚Äôs an Export Licensing Delay (Official SEC Filing),"After Nvidia dropped nearly 6% post-market, headlines started flying about a $5.5 billion ‚Äúloss‚Äù related to China. But here‚Äôs what the official Form 8-K filed with the SEC says‚Äîand why this might be a market overreaction based on misunderstanding.

‚∏ª

1. What Actually Happened?

On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government informed Nvidia that exports of its H20 chips (and any chip matching its bandwidth capabilities) to China, Hong Kong, Macau, and D:5 countries now require a license. On April 14, Nvidia was told the licensing requirement would remain in effect ‚Äúfor the indefinite future.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe USG indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.‚Äù


‚∏ª

2. The $5.5B Isn‚Äôt Cash Burn‚ÄîIt‚Äôs a Write-Down

Nvidia announced that their Q1 FY2026 earnings (ending April 27) will include ‚Äúup to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products‚Äù‚Äîcovering inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.

This is an accounting adjustment, not a hemorrhage of cash. If licenses are granted or chips are reallocated, parts of this may be recoverable.

‚ÄúCharges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.‚Äù


‚∏ª

3. No Total Ban = No Total Collapse

This isn‚Äôt an embargo. It‚Äôs a regulatory bottleneck. The chips can‚Äôt be exported until licenses are granted. The real unknown is how long the delay lasts‚Äîor if China will get permanently locked out. But Nvidia hasn‚Äôt been banned from selling globally.

‚∏ª

4. Why the 6% Drop May Be Overkill

Wall Street shaved ~$140B off Nvidia‚Äôs market cap on a forward-looking risk, not an operational miss. The charge is front-loaded. It doesn‚Äôt mean $5.5B vanishes every quarter.

This kind of drop only makes sense if you believe:
	‚Ä¢	Nvidia never gets licenses again
	‚Ä¢	China sales are permanently dead
	‚Ä¢	The H20 inventory is entirely unsellable

None of that is confirmed.

‚∏ª

5. Where It Goes From Here

Watch for:
	‚Ä¢	Any updates on U.S. Commerce Department export licenses
	‚Ä¢	Nvidia‚Äôs pivot: will they re-bin, re-market, or repurpose H20s?
	‚Ä¢	China‚Äôs own AI trajectory: will it accelerate local GPU production (Huawei, etc.)?

‚∏ª

TL;DR

Nvidia didn‚Äôt lose $5.5B in cash. The U.S. imposed a licensing requirement on certain chips, forcing Nvidia to adjust the value of inventory on hand. The chips aren‚Äôt bricked‚Äîthey‚Äôre just paused. The 6% drop might be a market overreaction, not a sign of long-term structural damage.

2025-04-16 13:22:49,Has More Chaos Stalled The Market Rally?,"Stock market data growth chart graph investment finance analysis fintech financial districtgetty The roller-coaster ride in the stock market has continued as Friday‚Äôs seemingly positive reduction in the tariffs on electric goods was deemed temporary on Sunday before the markets opened on Monday.   China‚Äôs new policy on not accepting the delivery of Boeing jets was announced early Tuesday which is a further sign that the trade war is heating up not cooling down. The new rhetoric on pharma tariffs once again does not exhibit any real understanding of what new tariffs might mean.  In a Tuesday CNBC interview, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb revealed that ‚Äújust about 70% of the key ingredients, key chemicals substances that are used‚Äù to make widely used generic drugs all originate in China.   The former FDA commissioner is concerned that additional tariffs on some of these life-saving drugs, which have a small profit margin, will not continue to be produced because of new tariffs.  After the market closed a regulatory filing by NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) reported that the U.S. ‚Äúrequired required licenses for exports to China of the company's H20 artificial intelligence chip.

Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) fell Wednesday morning as comments from executives on the potential impact of tariffs outweighed an estimate-beating first quarter. The trucking company on Tuesday reported first-quarter revenue of $2.92 billion andearnings per share (EPS)of $1.17, both down year-over-year but just above analysts' consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Several J.B. Hunt executives spoke on Tuesday's earnings call about how tariffs are impacting demand from its customers, as well as its own costs. CEO Shelley Simpson said the company's leadership ""has explored various options"" to ""more aggressively eliminate costs in some of our scenario planning analysis,"" according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. J.B. Hunt shares sank 6.5% in premarket trading Wednesday. They entered the day having lost more than 20% of their value since the start of the year. Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing Spencer Frazier said that tariffs ""have the potential to impact both supply and demand, but the magnitude and timing is difficult to predict,"" according to AlphaSense. ""Our customers continue to plan for multiple what if scenarios, but most of them are waiting for the dust to settle to determine how tariffs might influence and change their short- and long-term business strategies,"" Frazier added. ""As part of this scenario planning process, some customers are considering ways to alter supply chain freight flows and/or their country of origin sourcing. But these changes will be part of a much longer decision process."" Some customers are adjusting their supply chain in a number of ways like bringing in some shipments ahead of schedule, changing where they get products from, or possibly delaying or canceling some orders, Frazier said.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/jb-hunt-stock-sinks-as-logistics-firm-executives-say-tariffs-could-hit-demand-11716133,3

2025-04-16 14:45:00,Should You Tap Into Retirement Funds for a Down Payment? Here's What to Consider,"You‚Äôve been dreaming of owning a home, and you‚Äôve found the perfect one in a great neighborhood. But you don‚Äôt have enough for a down payment. You‚Äôre not alone: Coming up with money for upfront costs like down payments and closing costs is one of the biggest challenges for today‚Äôs homebuyers. For first-time homebuyers a typical down payment was 8% of the price of the home at the end of 2023, according to the National Association of Realtors data.And closing costs can range from 3% to 6% of the loan amount. One option to cover a down payment is to make a withdrawal¬†from a retirement account, like a 401(k) or IRA, or liquidate investments. After all, for many Americans, retirement accounts serve as both long-term savings and ongoing emergency funds.This may seem like a simple solution, but what does it mean for your long-term finances? Is it wise to dip into your retirement savings or investments to buy a home? We‚Äôll help you decide whether it‚Äôs¬†the right choice for you, and also provide alternative ways to finance your down payment. If you're short on a down payment but have a sizable 401(k), tapping it might seem like the easiest solution. ‚ÄúIn some cases, tapping into your retirement savings could be a smart move,‚Äù saysJonathan Thomas,CFP, a private wealth advisor at LVW Advisors. ‚ÄúEspecially if it helps you put down at least 20% and avoidprivate mortgage insurance (PMI).PMI can add a significant cost to your monthly mortgage payment, so eliminating it upfront could save you money in the long run.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat said,‚Äù Thomas continues, ‚Äúif you're considering using retirement savings, there are better options than your 401(k).‚Äù Consider the financial downsides of pulling from your 401(k) for a down payment. Most 401(k) plans penalize early withdrawals before age 59¬Ω. If you take money out early, you‚Äôll likely face: For example, if you withdraw $30,000, you could lose $3,000 in penalties and owe thousands more in taxes, depending on your tax bracket. Some exceptions exist for hardship withdrawals, but buying a home doesn‚Äôt always qualify; it depends on the employer‚Äôs plan. Sinceretirement accountsgrow over time thanks to compounding returns, early withdrawals reduce your current balance and eat into future growth. For example, withdrawing $30,000 today from a 401(k) instead of letting it grow for 30 years at an average 7% return could cost you over $228,000 in lost retirement savings.That‚Äôs a significant hit to your retirement security. Unless it‚Äôs an absolute necessity, withdrawing from a 401(k) early is rarely a good financial move. What else can you do? If using your retirement funds is your only option, the following strategies can help you avoid penalties: You can withdraw the amount you‚Äôve contributed to aRoth IRAat any point without penalties or taxes. However, you cannot withdraw earnings, i.e., the investment growth, without penalties before age 59¬Ω unless you meet certain exceptions. Since Roth IRAs are designed for tax-free growth, using them for a down payment now reduces their long-term benefit. An individual retirement account (IRA) is a tax-advantaged account for your retirement savings. If you have a traditional or Roth IRA, you can withdraw up to $10,000 in earnings penalty-free for a first-time home purchase. Keep in mind, taxes apply totraditional IRAwithdrawals. And $10,000 may not cover a full down payment, especially in high-cost housing markets. Roth IRA earnings must be at least five years old for penalty-free withdrawal. Some 401(k) plans let you borrow from yourself instead of withdrawing funds outright. Here‚Äôs how it works: You can borrow up to 50% of your401(k)balance up to a maximum of $50,000. As long as you repay the loan with interest, usually within 5 years (or longer if buying a primary residence), you won‚Äôt owe any withdrawal penalties or taxes. However, taking the loan means you‚Äôll miss out on future investment growth, which could stunt your long-term retirement plan progress. Also, some plans don‚Äôt allow contributions while you repay the loan, which could further slow your retirement savings. Finally, if you leave the employer that sponsors your 401(k) account, ‚ÄúYou will need to pay your loan in full,‚Äù saysfinancial plannerSa√Ød Israilov, CFP, of Israilov Financial. ‚ÄúSome plans allow you to pay on a monthly payment plan, but others might require you to pay off the entire loan balance immediately. If you can‚Äôt pay back the loan balance and you default, you could owe a 10% penalty on top of income taxes on the loan balance. Read your plan documents thoroughly, as repayment schedules and other loan requirements might vary.‚Äù Cashing out your money in stocks, bonds, or otherinvestmentsis a better alternative to tapping your retirement funds. Looking at the downsides, you‚Äôd want to note market timing, taxes, and risk tolerance before you proceed. Consider the following: If you‚Äôre saving for a home, consider these less volatile investment vehicles: If none of these options will work for you, there are other ways to fund your down payment without dipping into your retirement savings or investments. Here are additional ways to get the funds you need for a down payment: Gifted funds from family: Many lenders allow family gifts for down payments, but specific rules apply: Down payment assistance programs (DPAs): Local, state, and federal programs offer grants or low-interest loans to help with down payments: Side hustles or additional savings: Working tobuild up cash reservesover time helps prevent you from making any risky withdrawals. It varies, but first-time buyers often put between 8% and 13% down, while conventional loans typically require 5% to 20%. At age 59¬Ω or older withdrawals are penalty-free. Yes, but it‚Äôs not ideal. If you take money from your 401(k) before age 59¬Ω, you‚Äôll likely owe a 10% penalty plus income taxes on the amount withdrawn. If your plan allows it and you take a 401(k) loan instead, you will avoid penalties, but you‚Äôll need to repay the loan with interest, usually within five years. It depends on your situation. If buying a home is a short-term goal (within the next few years), it‚Äôs better to save in low-risk accounts (like a money market fund or high-yield savings account) rather than investing in stocks, which can be volatile. If homeownership is along-term goal, you can keep investing while gradually building up savings. Withdrawing retirement savings or selling investments for a down payment is tempting, but it comes with trade-offs‚Äîlike penalties, lost retirement savings growth, and tax consequences. Before you decide, consider low-down-payment mortgages, assistance programs, or saving in low-risk accounts. If you do decide to withdraw, try to take out the lowest amount possible so you‚Äôre not jeopardizing your savings for the future.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/using-retirement-savings-for-down-payment-11700255,4

Not really. Nvidia has done it before during market crises and has a history of booms and busts. But with the U.S. government now blocking key AI chip exports to China, triggering a $5.5 billion hit to Nvidia, history might be rhyming again. But here‚Äôs the twist: what if that kind of crash is exactly the opportunity it needs to rocket past the $3 trillion market cap? Let us be as clear as possible. We are saying: ""grab the stock with both hands if it crashes.""  We consistently scan for compelling buy opportunities in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception   Let's dig in more.  The $5.5 Billion Gut Punch  Nvidia has disclosed a staggering $5.5 billion charge tied to U.S. export restrictions on its H20 chips. These chips were specifically tailored for the Chinese market - now off-limits. Overnight, billions in inventory and contracts went up in smoke. This wasn‚Äôt just bad news - it was a reminder that Nvidia‚Äôs AI dominance is vulnerable to regulatory changes.And the market reacted fast, sending the stock tumbling.

Its track record in rough markets isn‚Äôt pretty. Just look at these fall percentage numbers from peak to bottom during past market crises.  2022 Inflation Shock: -62% COVID Panic: -38% 2008 Financial Crisis: -85%  And this time, we‚Äôre staring down a cocktail of problems:  U.S.-China tensions escalating Tariff waves hitting tech An overheated AI narrative that‚Äôs ripe for a reset A relatively high valuation (P/E of 37) vulnerable to margin compression  A sharp slowdown in AI spending, tighter regulations, or a broad market selloff could send Nvidia into one of its signature tailspins. A slide to $60 may sound dramatic - but it‚Äôs not unthinkable.  But That Slide, Even Partial, Is Exactly What We Are Waiting For Let‚Äôs flip the script.   Despite the regulatory headwinds, Nvidia is firing on all cylinders financially. It just clocked over 110% revenue growth in the past 12 months. Even last quarter - with all the noise - it delivered almost an 80% jump. Now picture this: let‚Äôs cut that growth in half - still amazing. Based on that, Nvidia could deliver over $100 billion in net income in the next 12 months. With a conservative 30x earnings multiple - which by the way is lower than Apple‚Äôs despite far higher growth and margins - you‚Äôre looking at a $3 trillion valuation.

2025-04-16 15:24:36,Here's Why There's A 'Silver Lining' For Nvidia After Trump‚Äôs China AI Chip Curb,"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline Artificial intelligence heavyweight Nvidia became the latest company entangled in President Donald Trump‚Äôs global trade war this week, though Wall Street analysts say it‚Äôs far from a disaster scenario for the chipmaker. This may be a ‚Äúconcession‚Äù from the Silicon Valley firm to get the White House to loosen further AI ... More regulations, one analyst speculated.¬© 2025 Bloomberg Finance LP  Key Facts   Nvidia reported late Tuesday it expects to take a $5.5 billion hit this quarter due to the U.S.‚Äô new severe restrictions on Nvidia exporting its H20 AI chips to China, curbs which pose an up to 10% earnings headwind for Nvidia this year, according to Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya.    The H20 restrictions are an ‚Äúunwelcome but somewhat expected, manageable risk‚Äù for Nvidia, explained Arya, leading a chorus of analysts largely interpreting the update as far from a worst-case scenario despite the brutal headline hit.    It‚Äôs ‚Äúnot enormous in the grand scheme of things‚Äù as China accounted for the lowest proportion of Nvidia revenue in more than a decade last year at 13%, wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, while Rosenblatt analysts Kevin Cassidy and Kevin Garrigan predicted in a Wednesday note to clients.    Nvidia can ‚Äúmake up most of this revenue‚Äù hit from China with sales of its latest graphics processing units (GPUs) outside of the Asian power.There‚Äôs a key ‚Äúsilver lining‚Äù to what is ‚Äúeffectively a ban‚Äù on Nvidia exporting its coveted AI technology to China, according to UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri: This may be a ‚Äúconcession‚Äù from the Silicon Valley firm to get the White House to ‚Äúto effectively kill‚Äù the Biden administration‚Äôs most severe AI regulatory frameworks.     Tangent Shares of Nvidia declined 7% Wednesday, wiping out nearly $200 billion in market capitalization. The losses for Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world other than Apple or Microsoft, dragged down the broader stock market, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dipped 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Hard hit were fellow semiconductor chip makers, as shares of Intel and TSMC both declined 3% and shares of Advanced Micro Devices tanked 6% after the company made a similar disclosure on losses tied to Chinese chip export curbs. Chief Critic Rasgon slammed the White House ban on Nvidia‚Äôs chips as making ‚Äúlittle sense‚Äù as it ‚Äúsimply hands the Chinese AI market over to Huawei.‚Äù Key Background This is the latest evidence of a choppy operating environment for American technology companies. Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore remarked ‚Äúthe ongoing volatility and resulting uncertainty surrounding the trade war between the US & China‚Äù has caused investors to be ‚Äúwhipsawed between hopes for exemptions/reconciliation and fears of further escalation.‚Äù The H20 chip curb comes less than two weeks after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly dined with Trump at the president‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago resort White House. Trump has spoken publicly about the influence of his discussions with business leaders on policy, saying Monday he ‚Äúhelped‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook by exempting smartphones from much of the damage of the Chinese tariffs. Nvidia dominates the market in designing the semiconductor technology necessary to power generative AI applications like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Tesla full self-driving.  Big Number 25%. That‚Äôs how much Nvidia shares are down since Election Day, far worse than the S&P‚Äôs 8% decline, not including dividends.

The U.S. government will require Nvidia to obtain an export license for its H20 chips. No word from AMD (yet), as its MI308 chips will also require an export license.   There are small signs that the U.S. and Chinese governments are slowly getting to a point of talking to one another, as China issued a statement saying that it would gladly negotiate once the U.S. appoints a representative. Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Vietnam underperformed. Meanwhile, India, Thailand, and Singapore all managed small gains. Hong Kong was led lower by growth stocks in a broad sell-off marked by poor breadth. Internet stocks were hurt by concerns about restaurant delivery margins after JD.com, which fell by -5.52%, said it wouldn‚Äôt make more than 5% margins on delivery, which dragged down Meituan, as well, which fell by -8.11%. I wonder whether restaurant vouchers will be part of the stimulus, which is why JD is promoting the fact that it is not price gouging restaurants.  There was very little green on the screen, as pharmaceuticals, technology hardware, electronics, internet, and electric vehicle stocks were all down. Mainland investors bought a healthy net $1.017 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks today. Mainland markets were also off, as growth underperformed. The ETFs favored by the ""National Team"", i.e. investment firms associated with China‚Äôs sovereign wealth, saw very high volumes going into the close, which lifted mega-capitalization stocks and pushed the Shanghai Composite into positive territory. Mainland media noted that Chinese banks have extended the RMB 100 billion in loans to companies in order to fund stock buybacks. March and Q1 data was what macroeconomic researcher Jared Dillian would call a ‚ÄúCostanza day.‚Äù Good news is actually bad news, referencing the Seinfeld episode when George Costanza does the opposite of his instincts, leading to positive results.   There has been chatter that the strong data will curb the potential for strong stimulus, but it appears overblown as tariff fronting was a factor. The coming stimulus will be to offset the effects of U.S. tariffs versus looking in the rearview mirror. China and Vietnam signed a trade memorandum of understanding (MOU).  March And Q1 Data Highlights:  Q1 GDP increased by +5.4% versus expectations of +5.2%. Q1 GDP versus Q4 2024 increased by +1.2% versus expectations of +1.4%.

Klein begins by touching on his concern about the consensus negativity in Washington, D.C. on both sides of the aisle toward China. I would agree that an anti-China genie was released out of the bottle, which will be hard to put back on, as the media has only further fanned the flames by historically throwing gasoline on the dumpster fire. In my opinion, it started back in President Barack Obama‚Äôs first term and is highly correlated with the growth in the size of the U.S. government and its spending the two talk about. Friedman makes an exceedingly good point about how China‚Äôs local governments support (subsidize) industries early on, creating a proverbial ‚ÄúFitness Center,‚Äù where only the strong can survive due to the vicious competition. The two talk about Huawei, solar, and EVs as byproducts of this ‚ÄúFitness Factory.‚Äù It was a very worthwhile listen, though I am more optimistic, as they fail to touch on how interconnected U.S. and Chinese businesspeople are. While the diplomats throw stones, businesspeople figure out ways to make things work and make money. I also believe markets and the economy are acting as a hard-to-deny truth serum, which the media is mainly reporting. Exhibit A would be tariff beneficiaries Ford and GM facing significant headwinds because of tariffs. The perpetually negative U.S. media is not the narrative those outside of the U.S. consume.

2025-04-16 15:52:22,"Will There Be A Recession? Some Economists Say It's Inevitable, Others Aren't Convinced","Forecasters are split on whether President Donald Trump's tariff campaign will push the economy into a recession, with many seeing increased risks.That's according to the 57 economists who responded to a Wall Street Journal survey in April. The poll showed that, on average, the forecasters predicted a 45% chance of the economy going into a recession in the next 12 months, up from 20% the last time the poll was taken in January.The economic outlook worsened significantly in February when Trump started announcing tariffs against U.S. trading partners. Many forecasters have changed their expectations that the U.S. would experience a ""soft landing"" from the post-pandemic surge of inflation to bracing for a downturn as the tariffs and other economic headwinds force businesses and households to reduce their spending. One expert laid out the reasons she expects a recession, another why a downturn is unlikely. Among the most pessimistic is Amy Crews Cutts, an independent forecaster, who said she was 99% confident of a recession taking hold within a year.Several recent surveys have supported Cutts's expectations that a recession is on the horizon. One was a survey of small business owners by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Over the course of several months, the owners' moods went from elation at Trump's election victory touncertainty about the impact of tariffs. An index measuring optimism plunged since January.A separate survey of business financial professionals showed that businesses were having a harder time getting paid by clients in recent months, suggesting financial stress building among the companies that keep the economy running. The National Association of Credit Managers' Credit Managers' Index, which Cutts oversees, showed the economy was still expanding in March but at a slower pace than before.Cutts was especially alarmed by remarks managers made in the open comment section of the survey, indicating they had seen an uptick in small businesses simply closing shop without declaring bankruptcy.Cutts also noted that Trump'son-again, off-again tariff announcementshave wreaked havoc on businesses that import goods from overseas, especially because the import taxes have not exempted goods ""on the water"" or already being shipped, meaning that some businesses could find themselves scrambling to cover unexpected costs.Canceled orders and financial stress could translate into an economic slowdown and job losses.Turbulence in financial marketscould also influence the economy. People whose stock portfolios have suffered are lesslikely to make purchases, possibly throwing sand into the gears of the main engine of the U.S. economy, consumer spending. Cutts said that damage has been done even if the punishingly high tariffs are eventually negotiated down or called off.""Even if I flipped a switch and tomorrow and said, 'Sorry, joke's on me, it all goes away,' it will take us several quarters to unwind the damage that's already happened,"" she said. ""So, for me, that says recession."" On the other end of the spectrum is Allen Sinai of Decision Economics, who gives only a 20% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. That's an increase from the 10% chance he saw in January, but still a relatively remote possibility.Chief among Sinai's reasons for optimism is the job market, which has stayed consistently resilient ever since bouncing back from the mass layoffs caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns. The unemployment ratewas 4.2% in March,not far from historic lows and nowhere near indicating an economic downturn.""We're fully employed right now,"" he said. ""The jobs count is fine.""Sinai also sees green flags in data about consumer spending, the pillar of the economy, responsible for 68% of the gross domestic product.Retail salessoared in March, recovering from a dip in January and a lukewarm February, although economists attributed some of the surge to people racing to make purchases before tariffs drive up prices.A main point of contention between recession optimists and pessimists iswhat to make of consumer sentiment data.Consumer surveys show that people have been increasingly worried about inflation, thehealth of the job market, and their own financial situations in recent months. If people pull back on spending, it could spell trouble for the economy. However, that shoe has yet to drop, and in the meantime, Sinai sees few signs that either the financial system or the job market is buckling.""It takes financial trouble in the system to shut off funds or the jobs market caves for one reason or another,"" he said.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/will-there-be-a-recession-some-economists-say-it-s-inevitable-others-aren-t-convinced-11715927,4

The development adds to a difficult 12 months for the plane maker's stock, which has struggled to gain investors‚Äô confidence after several highly publicized safety and manufacturing mishaps, compounded by aseven-week machinists strike, all of which weakened the company'sbalance sheet. Boeing shares were up 1.3% at $157.50 in mid-afternoon trading Wednesday. The stock has lost about 11% of its value since the start of the year. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Boeing‚Äôs chart and point out important price levels that investors may be watching. Tariff-driven selling in Boeing shares saw the price temporarily drop last week below the prominent November swing low, before promptly rebounding above that level to potentially form adouble bottom. More recently, the stock has drifted mostly sideways since last Wednesday‚Äôswide-ranging day, with therelative strength index (RSI)providing a reading just below the 50 threshold to signal neutral price momentum. Let‚Äôs identify importantsupport and resistancelevels on Boeing's chart and forecast a measured moveprice targetto put on the radar. The first support area to watch sits around $146. Aretracementto this level could attract buying interest near atrendlinethat connects a range of comparable trading activity on the chart stretching back to mid-April last year. A close below this level could see the shares revisit lower support at $137. Investors will likely keep a close on this area near the closely aligned November and Apriltroughsthat form the potential double bottom. A tailwind from current levels could see the shares initially climb to $166. This location provides aconfluenceof overhead resistance near the200-day moving averageand a series of swing lows that developed on the chart between April 2024 and January this year. Furtherupsidemay accelerate a move to around $187. The shares could face headwinds in this region near multiple peaks on the chart from last May to February. Investors can forecast an upside target using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as themeasuring principle. When applied to Boeing‚Äôs chart, we calculate the distance of the double bottom inpointsand add that amount to the pattern‚Äôsneckline. For example, we add $50 to $187, which projects a target of $237, around 52% above Tuesday‚Äôs closing price.

The researchers found that for the median graduate, a college degree paved the way for better-paying jobs, equivalent to a 12.5% annual return, above the 10.1% annualized return from theS&P 500 stock index since 1957.The analysis by Jaison Abel, head of microeconomics at the bank's research and statistics group, and Richard Deitz, an economic policy advisor, took into account tuition costs, typical levels of financial aid, and the ""opportunity cost"" of foregoing all the wages a student could earn by working straight out of high school instead of going to school.Although the math works out favorably for most students, everyone's situation is different. The investment didn't pay off for every school and every major. Students who don't get financial aid, those who attended more expensive schools, those who spent longer than four years to earn an undergraduate degree, and those who pursued majors that led to lower-paying careers saw less return on their investment, the researchers said in a separate blog post.For example, engineering majors earned a median return of 18%, while education majors saw a median 6% return (although, as the researchers noted, many educators' salaries are for working nine months a year).Overall, 25% of students got a median return of 2.6% a year for money they spent on college, making it a questionable investment, at least from a financial perspective.However, the researchers found that college still serves as a gateway to higher-paying professional occupations, making it a worthwhile investment over a 40-year working career.""The typical college graduate earns a return that easily surpasses the benchmark for a sound investment,"" they wrote.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/it-s-still-hard-to-beat-going-to-college-as-an-investment-11716374,3

2025-04-16 19:54:45,Where Your Makeup and Skincare Products Come From‚ÄîAnd How Tariffs Will Make Them Pricier,"Josh Seong / Investopedia From Korean skincare to French pharmacies, your makeup bag may be more international than you think‚Äîwhich could mean sticker shock the next time you stock up on brands like Laneige, La Roche-Posay and Elf Beauty. Beauty lovers and skincare enthusiasts, brace yourselves‚Äîthis could mean increases in the cost of lip and eye products, powder makeup, foundation, concealers, blush, sunscreen, moisturizers, and facial toners, among others. South Korea, France, Canada, Italy, and China were the top five countries from which the U.S. imported makeup and skincare products in 2024.¬†Because of various tariffs, cosmetics from these countries are likely to rise, some more than others. However, tariffs put into effect this year will likely take some time to hit shelves, saidMichael Sacco, managing director and national consumer and industrial products leader at tax and business advisory firm CBIZ. ‚ÄúThe beauty industry operates with a long supply chain cycle, which means you might not see increased prices this fiscal year."" he said. ""Any cost hikes are likely to be felt next year, giving the industry time to assess the necessary price adjustments that will ultimately affect consumers."" Sacco said many brands source key ingredients for beauty and skin care products, such as botanical extracts, emulsifiers, and preservatives from around the world. That could drive up prices for products made in the U.S. Many brands also source packaging like bottles, jars, tubes, and labels from China, which has a 145% tariff levied against it. The increased cost of packaging from China could mean ‚Äúsignificant challenges‚Äù for the beauty industry, he said. ‚ÄúPackaging already makes up a substantial portion of the cost of producing cosmetics, and many brands depend on China for their packaging due to its lower production costs,‚Äù Sacco said. Because of thevaried nature of Trump's tariff policies, not all countries that send makeup and skincare to the U.S. have the same levies applied to their goods. Further complicating the matter,temporary pausesin what the administration is calling ""reciprocal tariffs"" could add additional costs in the near future if a deal between countries cannot be reached. Here is snapshot of the top countries that supply beauty and skincare products to the U.S.: South Korea was the top exporter of makeup and beauty products to the U.S., sending more than $1.7 billion worth of products in 2024. More than 78% of this total was skincare products, especially ones with sunscreen, so your 10-step Korean skincare routine could get pricier. Social media-viral K-Beauty brands like Laneige, Cosrx, Beauty of Joseon, and Peach & Lily, among others, are likely to get more expensive under the 10% tariff that is currently levied against South Korean goods. However, if the two governments can not reach a deal, that amount will rise to 25%. France was the second top exporter of beauty and skincare products into the U.S. in 2024. Over 76% of France's $1.3 billion worth of beauty exports to the U.S. were skincare products. French skincare products have gone viral on social media. Those who love iconic French pharmacy brands like La Roche-Posay, Caudalie, Avene, and Nuxe might have to pay more for them if a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union resumes. The same goes for makeup and skincare products from Italy, which include brands such as Kiko Milano, Prada Beauty, Gucci Beauty, and Armani Beauty. However, for now, both countries' products are subject to a 10% tariff while the European Union and the U.S. government try to reach a trade agreement. There is some good news if you're a fan of Canadian skincare and makeup brands like The Ordinary or MAC Cosmetics. Even though the U.S. has 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, your makeup and skincare products from those countries are likely exempt because they are protected under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump signed in his first term. China is the fifth largest importer of beauty and skincare products to the U.S. In 2024, about 8.8% of makeup and skincare products shipped to the U.S. were from China alone, worth an estimated $671 million. In addition to pushing up the packing prices on other country's products, the Trump administration‚Äôs 145% tariffs on all imports from China could potentially double the price of skincare and cosmetic products made in the country, such as Wet n' Wild,Elf Beauty and Tarte.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/tariffs-could-increase-makeup-skincare-prices-11713305,4

Netflixoptionspricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday‚Äôs report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets areclosed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading intoNetflix‚Äôs report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. ‚ÄúThe market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,‚Äù wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average impliedearnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years. In the same note, JPMorgan compared the historical post-earnings moves of the 60largest S&P 500 stocksand their implied volatility this quarter. They found Netflix was among the stocks with the most underestimated‚Äîor ""cheapest""‚Äîpost-earningsvolatility. Over the past three years, the stock‚Äôs post-earnings move has averaged about 11%, making it and Meta Platforms (META) the most volatile names in JPMorgan's sample. Netflix's ""cheap"" implied volatility puts it in the minority. Traders are pricing in smaller-than-average moves for only nine of the 60 largest stocks in the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan's analysis. Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among those nine. Netflix stock has jumped following each of its last two earnings reports. Shares advanced nearly 10% the day after fourth-quarter earningstopped estimatesin January. The company also raised its revenueforecastfor 2025 and boosted its share buyback program by $15 billion. In October of last year, Netflixbeat expectationsfor itstop and bottom lines, and indicated strong demand for its ad-supported subscription tier, sending shares soaring more than 11% the next day. Netflix stock popped on Tuesday after a report that the streaming giant isaiming to double its revenueto about $78 billion by 2030, an ambitious goal that the company hopes will propel it into the $1 trillion market-capitalization club alongside tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN).

Despite this, the survey also showed that the majority of investors are continuing to hold their positions. The survey, fielded from April 12 to April 15, 2025, revealed 73% of respondents say they are at least ‚Äúsomewhat worried‚Äù about the recent sell off, while 44% reported being ""extremely worried‚Äù. Investor anxiety aboutrecent market volatilityis at its highest levels since 2021. In fact, more than half of individual investors reported they trust the stock market less under this administration, due to tariff policy uncertainty and a swift correction across capital markets. Inflationtops the list of Investopedia's readers‚Äô worries, tied to their concerns about the impacts of global tariffs levied by the White House, and new tariffs on semiconductors and copper set to take effect in the coming months. U.S. relations with China are also a top concern given the recent escalations of tariffs between the two countries. Respondents are similarly concerned that a trade war will lead to a recession, and potentially a global financial crisis and bear market. While Investopedia's readers may be the most worried they‚Äôve been in four years, most say they‚Äôre not making major changes to their allocation amid the volatility. Only 17% say they moved money out of the stock market, and into cash,money market fundsandCDs. More than half, or 58%, say they took advantage of the downturn, with 32% indicating that they useddollar-cost averagingin the market or into specific stocks. Only 6% say they are shorting the stock market to try to take advantage of potential further declines. Approximately 30% of investors didn‚Äôt give up hope on their favorite stocks, despite many of them, including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN),¬† Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR), tumbling deep into bear market territory. Data from VandaTrack showed record dip-buying flows from retail investors the week following April 2nd‚Äî what the White House called, ""Liberation Day""‚Äîincluding $3 billion in net purchases on April 3, the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting this data in 2014. Research from Bank of America also showed that its clients were net buyers of $8 billion worth of stock during the week of the initial tariff announcements. That was the fourth-largest weekly inflow in Bank of America's data since 2008, amid the Great Financial Crisis. Amanda Morelli / Investopedia Despite their waning trust in the capital markets under this administration, Investopedia's readers still favor U.S. stocks as the safest place to invest their money over the next five years. Given their experience with other periods of volatility and economic policy turmoil, many may believe that the stock market and the companies within it will eventually adjust to these new policies, and resume their ability to grow profits and reward shareholders. The growing drumbeat around a possible recession has also gotten louder over the past several weeks with prominent CEOs like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Larry Fink of Blackrock (BLK), warning of a severe economic downturn. A growing number of our readers agree, with one in four indicating that we are entering, or are already in, a recession.

Semtech Corporation et al., Case No. 2:25-cv-02058, on behalf of all persons and entities who acquired Semtech Corporation (‚ÄúSemtech‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (NASDAQ:SMTC) securities during the period from August 27, 2024, through February 7, 2025 (‚Äúthe Class Period‚Äù). Investors have until April 22, 2025, to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. [LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION] On February 7, 2025, Robert W. Baird & Co. cut its price target on Semtech stock from $80 to $60, noting a slower-than-expected uptake of Semtech‚Äôs active copper cables, which offer extended reach to allow for high volume switch-to-server connections. The brokerage also noted that it has seen muted Active Copper Cable (‚ÄúACC‚Äù) benchmarking activity overall as well. On this news, the price of Semtech shares declined by $5.99, from $60.50 per share on February 6, 2025, to close at $54.51 on February 7, 2025. On February 7, 2025, Semtech filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC. Therein, Semtech revealed for the first time that for fiscal year 2026, net sales from the Company‚Äôs CopperEdge products used in active copper cables ‚Äúare expected to be lower than the Company‚Äôs previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.‚Äù The Company also revealed that the ‚Äúrevised estimates are based on recent feedback from a server rack customer and correlated to discussions with end users of the server rack platform.‚Äù That customer was apparently NVIDIA. On this news, the price of Semtech shares fell by $16.91 per share, or approximately 31%, from $54.51 per share on February 7, 2025, to close at $37.60 on February 10, 2025. The complaint alleges that defendants, throughout the Class Period, has failed to disclose that Semtech‚Äôs CopperEdge products suffered from heating issues, which caused NVIDIA to curtail its purchases and develop its own processing unit.

2025-04-17 02:58:44,Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Blue Chip Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,"We recently published a list of15 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires. The US stock market is showing volatility after President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent announcement of sweeping 10% tariffs on all US trading partners and higher tariffs on countries with a trade deficit with the US. Economists and investors believe President Trump‚Äôs tariff policies could potentially lead to a trade war with America‚Äôs trading partners, propelling inflation even higher. These two factors could plunge the US into an economic slowdown, and the markets could potentially sell off quickly if a recession materializes among its looming threats. On April 10, CNBC reported that stock prices rose sharply a day before after declining for four days straight following President Trump‚Äôs announcement of a pause in a significant part of his tariff plan. The White House said that Democratic lawmakers were indulged in partisan games by inquiring if any stock market purchases conducted in recent days were undertaken with prior knowledge of the fact that President Trump would authorize a pause in his tariff plans. Trump announced higher tariffs on China even after he announced a 90-day pause for steeper-than-baseline rates for several other countries. READ ALSO:10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionairesand10 Best Organic Food Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. On April 11, Erica York, economist and the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation‚Äôs Center for Federal Tax Policy, talked to CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Exchange‚Äù about the ongoing scenario and said that the imposition of around 145% total tariff on Chinese goods would result in a suspension of most trade between the US and China. She said: ‚ÄúIt depends on how narrowly the tariff is applied or how broadly it‚Äôs applied, but generally, if you get north of a triple-digit tariff, you are cutting off most trade.‚Äù She further opined that: ‚ÄúThere may still be some things without any substitutes that companies just have to foot the bill, but for the most part, that cuts it off.‚Äù The economist said that Trump‚Äôs new China tariffs, along with the others he implemented, would raise the average tariff rate to record highs the country hasn‚Äôt seen since the 1940s. The current market volatility has created numerous remarkable investment opportunities, so let‚Äôs look at the 15 best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires. We reviewed financial media reports and ETFs to compile an initial list of blue chip stocks and selected stocks that have a 5-year revenue growth rate of at least 10%. We have also considered the popularity of these stocks among billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world‚Äôs leading hedge funds and companies. We also added the number of hedge fund holders for each stock as of fiscal Q4 2024, and¬†sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey‚Äôs database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Fiscal Q4 2025 marked another record quarter for the company, with a revenue of $39.3 billion, up 12% sequentially and 78% year on year. These trends highlight the company‚Äôs continued profitability. It expects to continue this profitability in the future, supported by products based on its new Blackwell GPU architecture. On April 11, Citi analyst Atif Malik cut his price target for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $163 but maintained a Buy rating. The analyst expects the company to partially pass down the tariffs-led potential increase in GPU expense amid the ongoing uncertainty, supported by AI GPU price inelasticity and NVIDIA Corporation‚Äôs (NASDAQ:NVDA) technology leadership. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy expressed bullish sentiments regarding the company in its Q4 2024 investorletter, especially because it is on schedule to satisfy the substantial demand for its new product, Blackwell, which will enter the market next year. Here is what it said about the company: ‚ÄúNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to outperform the market during the fourth quarter. The technology giant and top position in the fund delivered on sky-high expectations during the quarter and reported quarterly expectations that exceeded expectations. The red-hot company provided forward-looking expectations which were regarded as slightly lackluster as compared to prior quarters that smashed expectations. While the stock did churn a bit in the quarter, the AI giant remains top of mind for investors, especially as the company is on pace to satisfy the ‚Äòstaggering‚Äô demand for its new product, Blackwell, which is poised to enter the market over the next year. The company‚Äôs position of owning all the major pieces of the evolving AI data center enables it to strengthen its competitive position and to define the technology roadmap for generations to come.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 6thon our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires.

They‚Äôre great people, they‚Äôre brilliant people, and without tariffs, they wouldn‚Äôt be doing it.‚Äù Don‚Äôt Miss:‚ÄòScrolling To UBI' ‚Äî Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.

2025-04-17 11:00:15,"S&P, Nasdaq futures rise after selloff; UnitedHealth plunges after forecast cut","By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Purvi Agarwal (Reuters) -Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq regained some ground on Thursday on the final trading day of the week, with focus on U.S.-Japan tariff talks, while UnitedHealth's shares fell sharply following a forecast cut by the insurer. U.S. President Donald Trump said the country had made ""big progress"" in talks with Japan, one of the first rounds of face-to-face negotiations since his sweeping imposition of duties on global imports roiled markets and stoked recession fears. Investors will be closely watching all negotiation talks with dozens of countries over the coming weeks for more clarity on the size and scope of tariffs on individual nations and sectors. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth plummeted 19% after lowering its annual profit forecast on expectations of high medical costs for the remainder of the year. The stock weighed heavily on futures tied to the blue-chip Dow. Other health insurers also fell, with CVS Health down 9.1%, Centene losing 8.7% and Humana shedding 15%. Upbeat results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) helped U.S. chip stocks recover to some extent. Semiconductor shares had tumbled in the previous session after Nvidia flagged steep costs from new curbs on its AI chip exports to China. TSMC's U.S.-listed shares jumped 3% in premarket trading, while Nvidia rose 0.5% after falling nearly 7% on Wednesday. However, highlighting the sector's challenges, Intel lost 1.6% after a report the company will need a license to sell some of its advanced artificial intelligence chips to China. At 06:34 a.m., Dow E-minis were down 376 points, or 0.94%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 29 points, or 0.55%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 170.5 points, or 0.93%. On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Trump's tariff policies risked pushing inflation higher while weakening economic growth, adding policymakers needed more clarity before adjusting policy. ""With Trump having shown greater tolerance to market turmoil than anticipated and Powell now refusing to throw a lifeline, equities remain vulnerable,"" analysts at ING said on Thursday. Traders scaled back bets of a May interest rate cut, now pricing in just a 15.6% chance of a 25-basis point reduction from over 27% a week earlier, according to CME's FedWatch. Ahead of the long weekend, all three major Wall Street indexes are on track for weekly losses, with the S&P 500 on pace to lose about 1.6%. Amid volatile markets, last week was S&P's best week since November 2023. The week before that was its worst since 2020's pandemic-driven selloff. The CBOE Volatility index has eased off last week's highs but remains sharply above its 50-day moving average, indicating investors continue to expect volatile markets. ""The chronic problems of U.S. policy volatility, related uncertainties and negative economic spillovers are set to linger,"" said Ken Wattret, global economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. March housing starts and weekly jobless claims data are on deck, with comments from Fed board Governor Michael Barr expected later in the day. Netflix is scheduled to report results after the bell.

(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Trefis  Advanced Micro Devices stock appears relatively expensive, making it a costly investment at its current price of around $93. We believe there are some minor issues with AMD stock that contribute to its high valuation.  The surge in generative AI has fueled strong GPU demand, but AMD‚Äôs AI accelerator segment has fallen short of expectations. In Q4, AMD‚Äôs data center revenue‚Äîa key indicator of its AI chip performance‚Äîwas $3.9 billion, missing consensus estimates. The company also issued a soft outlook, noting that current-quarter data center sales may decline 7% sequentially. Former President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policies could also pose risks to companies like AMD. While there is limited clarity on the semiconductor tariffs due to inconsistent messaging from the White House, the threat remains for AMD, as it sources most of its chips from Taiwan and other parts of Asia. Additionally, AMD has a thinner margin buffer to withstand tariffs compared to competitors like Nvidia due to its lower gross margins.   Our assessment of Advanced Micro Devices using key parameters like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows the company is strong operationally and financially, despite its rich valuation. For those seeking returns with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers an alternative‚Äîit has outpaced the S&P 500 and delivered over 91% returns since inception.

2025-04-17 12:01:32,Forbes Daily: Americans Keep Spending Despite Low Consumer Confidence,"Tariff uncertainty and an unstable stock market are weighing on U.S. consumer confidence‚Äîit‚Äôs down more than 30% since December. But that doesn‚Äôt mean Americans have stopped spending money.  March data from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals that most retail segments posted growth for the month, with auto dealers getting the biggest bump‚Äîup 9.2% as consumers rushed to buy cars before tariffs went into effect. Americans also spent more on furniture and even dined out more, as spending remained counterintuitively strong.   ‚ÄúPerhaps things aren‚Äôt as dour as the consumer sentiment figures would lead you to believe,‚Äù Bankrate senior industry analyst Ted Rossman told Forbes. ‚ÄúThe past several years, Americans have continued spending despite financial worries and challenges.‚Äù  FIRST UPFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday.Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday echoed warnings about the impact of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs, saying that they‚Äôre ‚Äúlikely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation.‚Äù Powell also talked about the current challenge of pursuing further interest rate cuts, indicating that the Fed would wait for ‚Äúmore clarity.‚Äù Trump responded in a Truth Social post Thursday morning, saying Powell‚Äôs ‚Äútermination cannot come fast enough!‚Äù  A federal judge ruled that the Trump Administration likely committed criminal contempt when it flew migrants to El Salvador last month, despite a court ruling forbidding it. Judge James Boasberg said he will give the government a chance to ‚Äúpurge‚Äù its contempt‚Äîlikely by returning the migrants it deported‚Äîbefore moving forward with identifying who was responsible for defying his order and referring them for prosecution.

BUSINESS + FINANCE A Tesla owner with a note on her Model X drives by protesters outside of a Tesla store in Palo Alto, California.Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images Tesla sales in California dropped 15% last quarter, which meant that the EV maker fell below 50% market share in the state for the first time. The decline is about on par with Tesla‚Äôs 13% drop globally in Q1, though its dip in the Golden State coincided with an overall 7.3% increase in EV sales. AI heavyweight Nvidia found itself entangled in the global trade war this week, disclosing that it expects a $5.5 billion hit in Q2 due to chip export restrictions, though Wall Street analysts say it‚Äôs far from a disaster scenario. China represented the lowest proportion of Nvidia‚Äôs revenue in a decade last year, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon notes, and UBS‚Äô Timothy Arcuri wrote it could be a ‚Äúconcession‚Äù from the semiconductor firm to press the White House to pull back on other AI regulations. WEALTH + ENTREPRENEURSHIP In 2016, college dropout Lucy Guo cofounded artificial intelligence firm Scale AI with Alexandr Wang. Guo left the company just two years later, but she astutely held on to most of her stake in Scale AI while pursuing her next startup. It‚Äôs paid off. With Scale AI wrapping up a tender offer that reportedly values the company at $25 billion, the 30-year-old cofounder is now the youngest self-made woman billionaire in the world, unseating Taylor Swift. Elon Musk‚Äôs pronatalist viewpoint is no secret, and reporting from the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday went into detail on the ‚Äúharem drama‚Äù surrounding the 14 known children the billionaire has had with four women. One of them is 26-year-old conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair, who said that Musk is highly sensitive to privacy concerns; he had originally offered her $15 million to keep his paternity secret, plus $100,000 per month until their child turns 21, which she refused.

A bipartisan House panel released a report Wednesday accusing DeepSeek of posing a ‚Äúprofound threat‚Äù to U.S. national security, alleging the AI startup harvests user data on behalf of the Chinese government. The report cites testimony from OpenAI, which told the committee DeepSeek likely relied on ‚Äúunlawful‚Äù techniques to train its AI models and ‚Äúcircumvented guardrails‚Äù to accelerate development at lower costs. MONEY + POLITICS  California became the first state to mount a legal challenge against President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs, filing a lawsuit in federal district court Wednesday that alleges Trump has unlawfully imposed tariffs that present ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable harm‚Äù to the state‚Äôs economy. California is the fifth-largest economy in the world and the biggest importer of any U.S. state, according to the New York Times.

DAILY COVER STORY Why An M.B.A. Is A Mistake For Most Small Biz OwnersLiz Picarazzi, perched on one of the rat-proof trash bins her company, CITIBIN, has deployed in New York, doesn't believe her M.B.A. has helped her as an entrepreneur. But it did help her snag corporate jobs and pay off her student loans.Buck Ennis/CNYB After leaving his job as a Senate staffer 25 years ago, Alan Pentz spent two years earning his M.B.A. from the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. He then went on to build the Corner Alliance into a $35-million-in-revenue government consulting firm, and later launched The Owner Institute, a coaching firm for small business owners. Now, the 52-year-old offers a free piece of advice to potential entrepreneurs: Don‚Äôt waste time like I did, earning an M.B.A. Pentz insists that the best business education comes from actually running a business. Fellow McCombs M.B.A. alumnus Liz Picarazzi agrees: Her classes didn‚Äôt help much in her current business, CITIBIN, which makes rat-proof outdoor trash bins found in New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia. What Picarazzi does admit, however, is that her M.B.A. helped her get a corporate job that led to her time as an entrepreneur. There‚Äôs a perennial debate on LinkedIn about whether earning an M.B.A. makes sense. The arguments typically boil down to: Get the degree if you‚Äôre looking to ascend to the C-Suite of a blue chip company or be a consultant at a firm like McKinsey. Skip it if your goal is building or buying your own small business. Business school tuition averages $46,700 a year for an in-person degree, and for an elite school it can amount to more than $70,000 per year. Plus, Pentz argues that having an M.B.A. could even hurt when trying to buy a small business. Flaunt a big name business credential and it‚Äôs likely the seller will ‚Äúraise the price,‚Äù he says. WHY IT MATTERS ‚ÄúM.B.A.s are expensive. And that‚Äôs just the tuition,‚Äù says Forbes‚Äô Brandon Kochkodin. ‚ÄúAdd in the opportunity cost of not working for two years, and the price climbs toward $300,000. For aspiring small business owners, the payoff isn‚Äôt clear. ‚Ä¶ The M.B.A. is seen as the go-to degree for people who aren‚Äôt sure what they want. But if small business is the goal, it might be the last thing you need, unless you‚Äôre in one of the few programs built for it.‚Äù MORE Small Business Loans Could Be Easier To Get, Thanks To This Entrepreneur FACTS + COMMENTS In an unusual move, United Airlines provided investors with dueling economic outlooks this week, highlighting how economic uncertainty and weakening demand have upended the airline industry: $11.50 to $13.50: What United expects earnings per share to be this year in a ‚Äústable environment scenario‚Äù $7 to $9: The projected earnings per share in a ‚Äúrecessionary environment scenario‚Äù ‚ÄòImpossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence‚Äô: What United said in its securities filing on Tuesday, explaining why it provided the two outlooks STRATEGY + SUCCESS For many small business owners, the first sign of success is the feeling of being overwhelmed‚Äîif every decision needs your attention, it might feel like the business is starting to own you.

2025-04-17 12:30:00,2 Top Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in April,"Quantum computing hasn't received much attention lately, with all the focus on the general economy and the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff plans. However, if you look at some of the pure-play quantum computing investments, likeIonQorD-Wave Quantum, it's clear that these stocks have completely fallen out of favor with the market due to their high risk. These stocks are down over 30% at the time of this writing, but they're not the quantum computing stocks I'm buying. Instead, I'm focusing on some of the larger players in the space, since they are also selling off quite heavily and appear to be excellent values right now. The two that I think are top buys right now areAlphabet(GOOG-1.92%)(GOOGL-1.85%)andNvidia(NVDA-7.03%). Each is well off its all-time high. Alphabet kicked off the latest round of hype in December when it announced that its Willow quantum computing chip had a novel way of reducing computational errors inherent to quantum computers. Quantum computers are differentthan regular computers since they don't transmit information in binary form (1s and 0s). There isn't any way to interpret a 1 or a 0 improperly, so there aren't any inherent errors in the system. Quantum computing transmits information in qubits, which can better be described as the probability of an answer being a 1 or a 0, and the value is often transmitted as a number between these two points. Because there are rounding errors and other aspects of uncertainty with a quantum computer, errors start to enter a calculation. This is a huge problem because quantum computing loses its edge over traditional computing if the same process is run multiple times to ensure that the correct answer is obtained. Alphabet's breakthrough involved arranging its qubits in a grid-like system to increase the interaction between them, thus reducing the number of errors in a calculation. This innovation spurred interest in quantum computing until Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang crashed it in January. In January, Huang said that useful quantum computing was over a decade away. However, he recently retracted that statement during the 2025 GTC, its global artificial intelligence conference, by inviting several of the top quantum computing companies to present information on their technology. Now, Nvidia has pivoted to supporting these companies through its QPU (quantum processing unit) products. Nvidia isn't directly getting involved in the quantum computing race; it's choosing to support these companies by providing the hardware necessary to control and direct computing resources. Through its already successful CUDA software, it has developed some computing libraries that help accelerate the research into developing useful quantum computing. This is an excellent place for Nvidia to be, as quantum computers need classical hardware,like Nvidia's flagship GPUs. So Alphabet and Nvidia are both highly involved in the quantum computing race, and the current state of each business makes them excellent buys. Neither company needs quantum computing to go in its favor to make investors a profit. Each has viable businesses right now that are solid and have not priced in any quantum computing success. Alphabet and Nvidia are trading for valuations not seen since the start of 2023, when there was widespread fear about a recession.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts; PE = price to earnings. We've returned to that fear point again in the markets, but each time both of these stocks have recovered and reached a new high. Right now, the broader market, as measured by theS&P 500, trades around20 times forward earnings.This means that Alphabet trades at a discount to the market, and Nvidia trades for only a bit of a premium. Considering that each of these companies is a strong competitor in AI and has lots of growth ahead, these prices seem like absolute bargains. While some of the pure quantum computing plays have sold off heavily, the large businesses competing in quantum computing have sold off a similar amount. As a result,I want to buy the stronger companies, as they don't need quantum computing to pan out to be successful investments.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/17/2-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-april/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=10a16b85-759a-4c15-8a3f-8609fb3e8855&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-17 12:42:46,Stock Futures Trim Gains as Trump Rebukes Powell: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- US stock futures trimmed an advance after President Donald Trump berated Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for being slow to cut interest rates.

Treasury yields climbed after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his commitment to keeping inflation in check. A gauge of the dollar climbed. Following the turmoil triggered by the announcement of broad US levies earlier this month, investors are focusing more on developments in country-specific trade negotiations. Key questions surround China, after Beijing indicated Wednesday it has several conditions for agreeing to talks with the Trump administration. ‚ÄúHopes for good trade talks between the US and other countries after initial progress with Japan is one of the main drivers for US equity futures turning to green territory,‚Äù said Mathieu Racheter, Julius Baer head of equity strategy. ‚ÄúBut that comes after quite a drop yesterday, so I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into the daily price action. The path of least resistance still remains to the downside.‚Äù The ECB is expected to cut rates for the seventh time later Thursday, after Trump‚Äôs tariffs darkened the economic outlook. With trade negotiations still in flux, President Christine Lagarde is unlikely offer clear indications on where rates will go next. Meanwhile, Powell on Wednesday signaled a wait-and-see approach to tariffs, pushing back on hopes the central bank would act quickly to soothe investor fears. His comments, along with concerns over the impact of tariffs on the tech sector, helped end a two-day consolidation in stocks. ‚ÄúThe only ‚ÄòFed put‚Äô that the Fed could envisage is if there was a risk of market dislocation, which is not the case at the moment,‚Äù said Enguerrand Artaz, a fund manager at La Financi√®re de l‚ÄôEchiquier. ‚ÄúWhen you look at the data, there is no need to intervene. Markets going down is not a reason in itself to intervene, especially not at these levels of valuation.‚Äù In earnings news, UnitedHealth Group Inc. plunged 21% in premarket trading after the company cut its earnings outlook for the year and reported first-quarter earnings below estimates. Shares in other health insurers tumbled. TSMC‚Äôs US-listed shares rose after the main chipmaker for Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. forecast sales for the second quarter that beat analyst estimates. Elsewhere, Eli Lilly & Co. soared on positive data from a weight-loss pill study. Shares in Herm√®s dropped after sales at the start of the year were hurt by a slowdown in Chinese luxury demand. Siemens Energy AG surged as much as 14% after the company boosted its revenue and net income outlook. On the trade front, the US and Japan kicked off negotiations with an aim to reach a deal as soon as possible, top Japan negotiator Ryosei Akazawa said. Preparations are underway for a second round of discussions later this month, he said. Countries are racing to negotiate deals with the US to avert high import taxes Trump imposed ‚Äî and then quickly paused ‚Äî on about 60 trading partners. That move put a 24% across-the-board tariff on Japanese imports on hold, though a 10% baseline charge still applies ‚Äî as well as 25% levies on cars, steel and aluminum. ‚ÄúThe trajectory of US-Japan trade talks will continue to be closely monitored, not just for their bilateral implications, but also as a potential framework for how the US may approach trade relationships with other allies,‚Äù said Rajeev De Mello, a global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management.

2025-04-17 13:10:00,"Nvidia's New Mainstream Graphics Cards Look Good, but Price Is a Wildcard","Nvidia(NVDA-7.03%)has now filled out its lineup of Blackwell-based gaming graphics cards with the unveiling of the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti. Two variants of the RTX 5060 Ti are available now, priced at $379 and $429, while the cheaper $299 RTX 5060 goes on sale in May. Nvidia faces plenty of competition in the mainstream and budget portions of the graphics card market, not only fromAMD, but also fromIntel. AMD launched higher-end graphics cards as part ofits RX 9000 serieslast month, and mainstream cards are likely to come soon. That followedIntel's late-2024 launch of Battlemage, its second attempt at discrete graphics cards that garnered positive reviews and were attractively priced. Nvidia is getting somewhat aggressive on pricing with the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti, which makes sense, given the competitive environment. The top-tier RTX 5060 Ti has an MSRP that's $70 below its predecessor, while the RTX 5060 will match the price of the RTX 4060. According to a review from Tom's Hardware, the RTX 5060 Ti provides a solid performance boost over the last-generation version. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel haven't been able to produce enough graphics cards to meet demand, and artificial intelligence (AI) chips are part of the problem. All three companies outsource GPU production toTSMC, and much of the available manufacturing capacity is going toward data center GPUs aimed at training and running advanced AI models. This has led to poor availability and sky-high prices well beyond manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). If these new graphics cards from Nvidia actually sell at MSRP, the company will certainly have a winner on its hands. However, there's not much reason to believe supply will be any better than it has been with recent launches. Tariffs could create another headache. While graphics cards appear to be currently exempt from the Trump administration's tariffs, that may not remain true for long. Nvidia's partners, which assemble and sell its gaming graphics cards, are generally based in China or other parts of Asia. Tariffs could spike prices further and reduce demand. Nvidia dominates the market for graphics cards, partly because its products offer great performance and industry-leading features, but also partly due to some serious customer loyalty. Shortages and high prices are putting that loyalty to the test, though, and the longer this situation drags on, the higher the risk that gamers will opt for available alternatives. Nvidia's unitmarket sharestood at 90% in the third quarter of last year. Nvidia's data center segment, which covers its AI accelerators, generated more than 10 times as much revenue as the gaming segment during the last reported quarter. While Nvidia is leaving money on the table by failing to meet demand for its gaming GPUs, it makes sense to do so since data center GPUs are far more lucrative. However, it's hard to predict what future demand looks like for AI accelerators. There are plenty of estimates calling for explosive growth to continue, but there are also reports of companies likeMicrosoftpulling back on data center leases. If Nvidia's results are being partly driven by overbuilding and overinvesting across the tech industry in AI infrastructure, demand could become a problem down the road. In that scenario, Nvidia's gaming business will become more important. At least on paper, Nvidia's new mainstream graphics cards are more affordable than their predecessors. MSRPs mean little right now, though, and if the company can't get enough supply to the market, retail prices could end up dramatically higher. Nvidia remains the overwhelming market-share leader, but it's not making its customers happy with a lack of availability and inflated retail prices.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/17/nvidias-new-mainstream-graphics-cards-look-good-bu/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=12bfe2b2-19c8-485d-9bf3-0ac45c0b6aa9&.tsrc=rss,3

2025-04-17 14:55:08,How Will Your 401(k) Fare if Trump Tariffs Push Foreign Investors Out of U.S. Stocks?,"Trade wars reshape global investment flows, so it's no surprise that President Donald Trump's April 2025 tariff announcement sent investors worldwide scrambling to rethink their U.S. equity positions.The potential for prolonged economic fragmentation, supply chain disruptions, and declining corporate margins fundamentally shifted the thesis that had drivenforeign investorsto hold 17% of U.S. equities as of 2024,up from 9%in 2006. But why would foreigners rotate out of the U.S. equities market, and why would that matter for Americans' portfolios? We dig into this below. In the months before Trump's tariff announcement, some analysts were worried abouttoo muchforeign investment, with billions rushing into American markets in late 2024 and early 2025. In 2024, theS&P 500, the quintessential U.S. large-cap index, rose 23.9%, almost five times that of the 4.9% return for the MSCI All-World Ex-USA Index, which tracks mid- and large-cap non-U.S. stocks. With many world markets trading sideways since the pandemic‚Äîthe U.S. economy was among the few to show significant growth in recent years‚Äîforeign investors feared missing out on the gains from the so-calledMagnificent Seven(the likes of Apple Inc. [AAPL], NVIDIA Corp. [NVDA], Tesla, Inc. [TSLA], etc.) and other propulsive American stocks. Pointing to data showing run-ups in foreign purchases of U.S. stocks before the 1987 crash, thedot-com bubblein 2000, and the 2008 financial crisis, Ed Yardeni wrote in his eponymous research newsletter, ""Their buying has a record of being a contrary indicator. They tend to be big buyers right before bear markets."" The April 2025 tariff announcement changed all thattout de suite, with the U.S. ""exceptionalism premium""‚Äîthe bump American stocks get from the perception of U.S. markets as uniquely stable and predictable‚Äîthe first to go. ‚ÄúWe tainted our brand‚Äîour U.S. brand,‚Äù Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, toldBarron's. ‚ÄúForeigners have a huge amount of ownership of U.S. assets, and if they decide to take their money home,"" prices for bonds, equities, and the dollar would see the effect. Foreign investors fleeing U.S. equities would put pressure on their prices, increase marketvolatility, and potentially lead to higher interest rates and a weaker dollar. The weaker demand for these and other American assets could slow economic growth and put a dent in Americans' retirement portfolios. In addition to seeking safe havens in their own domestic bonds and currencies, there are other reasons for capital rotation out of the U.S. They might amount to an end to a bullish era for foreign investors in U.S. stocks: Any significant rotation of foreign capital away from U.S. equities, closing a decade of American market dominance, would have significant implications for U.S. stock prices and American retirement portfolios. What we're seeing, Justin Leverenz, a chief investment officer at Invesco, said in a company memo, is ""the end of [American] exceptionalism. And this may only be the beginning.""",News,https://www.investopedia.com/trump-tariffs-and-stock-market-11711619,4

2025-04-17 15:55:25,"Negative Signs Are Mounting for NVDA, Veteran Investor Says","Reacting to Nvidia's (NVDA) recently announced writedown, Dan Niles,¬† the founder and Portfolio Manager of Niles Investment Management, questioned why the company apparently could not find any other buyers besides China for these AI chips. Speaking on CNBC, Niles listed other signs which, he indicated, suggest that the demand for NVDA's chips has weakened. Additionally, he predicted that the second-quarter estimates for NVDA and the other members of the Mag 7 would be cut in the near-to-medium term. Signs of Slowing Demand for NVDA's Chips ""If the demand for Nvidia's chips is far outstripping supply, why did it write down the value of (a portion of ) its chips to zero? They couldn't find any other takers (besides China) for these chips?"" he asked rhetorically. He also noted that Nvidia's customers expect their capital expenditures to rise only about 5% this year, versus last year's jump of about 15%. Finally, he pointed out that MSFT has abandoned a number of its data center leases, while the relatively cheap DeepSeek model of building AI systems is starting to be used in the U.S. In light of these points, Niles contends that the ""end demand (for Nvidia's products) is probably not as strong as most believe."" Niles Is Bearish on the Rest of the Mag 7 Niles expects the estimates for all of the Mag 7's Q2 results to drop after they report their Q1 results. Asked whether he was looking to buy any of these names, Niles said ""I don't get in front of estimate cuts."" He added that the valuation of the Mag 7 components remains high. In addition to NVDA and MSFT, Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG),¬† Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) are members of the Mag 7. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2025-04-17 16:00:00,Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Alphabet vs. Nvidia,"Tech giantsAlphabet(GOOG-1.20%)(GOOGL-1.11%)andNvidia(NVDA-2.88%)are among the businesses at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI), making them compelling AI investments. Each offers a different aspect of the AI ecosystem to invest in. Nvidia is a leader in the semiconductor hardware AI needs to operate oncloud computinginfrastructure, such as Alphabet's Google Cloud platform. Alphabet's software products deliver AI's benefits to consumers. For example, its Google search engine shows AI-generated responses to many search queries. Given that Alphabet and Nvidia operate in different areas of the AI sector, is one a better AI investment over the other? Getting to an answer requires digging into each tech titan in more depth. Like many of its tech peers, Alphabet is investing heavily into AI. It poured $52.5 billion intocapital expenditures (capex)last year, and expects to up that to $75 billion in 2025. These costs are a necessity. Alphabet's AI must win over consumers because people are starting to shift away from search engines, such as Google, in favor of AI tools. Research firmGartnerpredicts search engine usage will drop by a whopping 25% in 2026 as people adopt AI apps instead, such as OpenAI'sChatGPT. Google accounted for a massive $198.1 billion of Alphabet's $350 billion in 2025 revenue. So Alphabet needs AI users to embrace its artificial intelligence solutions to keep Google revenue from falling. So far, Alphabet's AI products are succeeding. Its Google Cloud customers are using the platform to build AI for their businesses, and usage has surged eightfold over the past 18 months. This contributed to Google Cloud revenue rising to $43.2 billion in 2024, up from 2023's $33.1 billion. Alphabet is also working on quantum computers, tech that could supercharge AI. In December, the conglomerate announced Willow, a quantum chip capable of completing calculations in minutes that would take today's supercomputers centuries to complete. Willow is still experimental, but if Alphabet can bring the chip into broad use eventually, this could be a game changer. Nvidia's outsize success amid the AI boom understandably captured headlines. The firm enjoyed jaw-dropping 114% sales growth to $130.5 billion in its 2025 fiscal year, ended Jan. 26. That success was driven by tech companies, such as Alphabet, buying Nvidia products to build AI capabilities in their cloud data centers. Nvidia is likely to enjoy further sales growth in 2025 given the expanded capex spending from Alphabet and others. In fact, Nvidia expects $43 billion in first-quarter sales for its 2026 fiscal year, up from the prior year's $26 billion. But how long will the company's soaring sales continue? It could be years as the AI industry evolves. In the last couple of years, businesses focused on building and training powerful AI software. With these systems up and running, the next AI phase is ramping up. This next period is referred to as the ""age of AI reasoning."" It focuses on post-training refinement of AI models to not only process data and information, but to more closely mimic human thinking, like drawing conclusions from the data. Businesses will need more computing power to deliver this capability, and Nvidia is providing it with its new Blackwell Ultra platform, announced in March. Alphabet is already among the tech luminaries adopting Blackwell Ultra, which is expected to come out in the second half of this year. And like Alphabet, Nvidia is also looking ahead to quantum computers. It launched a quantum computing research center to help build a quantum machine capable of widespread use. Alphabet's and Nvidia's AI capabilities make deciding which to invest in a difficult choice. Adding to the challenge is that both possess stellar financials. Alphabet's 2024 revenue of $350 billion was a 14% year-over-year increase, resulting in net income of $100.1 billion andfree cash flow(FCF) of $24.8 billion. Nvidia's 114% year-over-year jump up to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025 sales led to $72.9 billion in net income and $60.7 billion in FCF. One factor to help with the decision is to consider stock valuation using theprice-to-earnings(P/E) ratio. This commonly employed metric tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings.  Data byYCharts. Nvidia's stock is currently more reasonably valued after its share price fell amid recent stock market volatility. However, as of the time of this writing, its P/E multiple of 37.8 remains higher than Alphabet's 19.5, suggesting Alphabet is a better value. That said, Nvidia's stock arguably warrants a greater valuation due to factors such as the company's larger FCF, and the risk to Alphabet's Google search business amid rising consumer AI usage. Indeed, it may be wise to see how Google's income changes throughout 2025 before deciding to invest in Alphabet. Meanwhile, Nvidia makes an attractive investment because of its leadership in AI semiconductor components and strong growth prospects as the AI industry evolves. And with a better valuation, now appears to be a good time to pick up shares. These factors make Nvidia the superior AI stock to invest in right now.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/17/better-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-alphabet-v/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=af358e89-c848-4dd5-a295-4cb08f04a2d3&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-17 16:10:43,Trump Trade: Nvidia sees Q1 charges of $5.5B due to H20 restrictions,"Catch up on the top industries and stocks that were impacted, or were predicted to be impacted, by the comments, actions and policies of PresidentDonald Trumpwith this daily recap compiled by The Fly: Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter withTop Smart Score Stocks. Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities usingTipranks' Stock Screener. RESTRICTIONS:In a regulatory filing, Nvidia(NVDA) stated, ‚ÄúOn April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed NVIDIA Corporation, or the company, that the USG requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of the Company‚Äôs H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20‚Äôs memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. The USG indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China. On April 14, 2025, the USG informed the company that the license requirement will be in effect for the indefinite future. The company‚Äôs first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ends on April 27, 2025. First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.‚Äù Wells Fargo notes that following Nvidia‚Äôs 8K announcement last night,AMD(AMD)has filed an 8K this morning announcing that it too expects new U.S. Government license controls on GPU sales into China to impact the company‚Äôs MI308X. AMD says that while it expects to apply for licenses, there are no assurances that licenses will be granted. Therefore, the company is announcing that it expects to take up to an $800M inventory, purchase commitment, and related reserve charge, likely in Q2, says Wells. The firm has an Overweight rating on AMD with a price target of $140. PARTS FROM CHINA:Tesla‚Äôs(TSLA) plans to ship parts from China for the Cybercab and Semi electric trucks in the U.S. were suspended after President DonaldTrumpraised tariffs on Chinese goods, Reutersreports, citing a person with direct knowledge. The move may disrupt the company‚Äôs plans to begin mass production of the models. Tesla was prepared to absorb the costs when Trump imposed the 34%tariffon Chinese goods but could not do so when the tariffs were increased, leaving shipping plans suspended, the person told Reuters. DELISTING:Officials in President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration and the president‚Äôs supporters are ‚Äúleaning further into the prospect of delisting the nearly 300 Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges,‚Äù according to a recap fromPolitico. On April 10, Fox Business Network‚Äôs Charles Gasparino previously reported, citing sources, that the Trump administration was proceeding toward a possible delisting of Chinese public company shares on U.S. exchanges. Chinese companies that publicly trade in the U.S. include Alibaba(BABA), Yum China(YUMC), Tencent(TCEHY), NetEase(NTES),PDD(PDD),Nio(NIO), Baidu(BIDU), andJD.com(JD). EARTH MINERALS EXPORTS:China has suspended exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets as part of China‚Äôs retaliation for President Trump‚Äôs sharp increase in tariffs that started on April 2, the New York Times‚Äô Keith Bradsherreported. On April 4, the Chinese government ordered restrictions on the export of six heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as rare earth magnets, 90% of which are produced in China, the report noted. Publicly traded companies in the space includeMP(MP). FARMERS:In a post to Truth Social, President Donald Trumpstated, ‚ÄúOur farmers are GREAT, but because of their GREATNESS, they are always put on the Front Line with our adversaries, such as China, whenever there is a Trade negotiation or, in this case, a Trade War. The same thing happened in my First Term. China was brutal to our Farmers, I these Patriots to just hold on, and a great trade deal was made. I rewarded our farmers with a payment of $28 Billion Dollars, all through the China deal. It was a great transaction for the USA, until Crooked Joe Biden came in and didn‚Äôt enforce it. China largely reneged on the deal (although they behaved during the Trump Administration), only buying a portion of what they agreed to buy. They had ZERO respect for the Crooked Biden Administration, and who can blame them for that? Interestingly, they just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will ‚Äònot take possession‚Äô of fully committed to aircraft. The USA will PROTECT OUR FARMERS!!!‚Äù Publicly traded companies in agriculture space include Andersons(ANDE), Archer Daniels(ADM), Bunge(BG),CFIndustries(CF), Compass Minerals(CMP), Intrepid Potash(IPI) and Mosaic(MOS). LITTLE PROGRESS WITH EU:Officials from the European Union and U.S. made little progress bridging trade differences this week and officials from President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration indicated that the bulk of the U.S. tariffs imposed on the bloc will not be removed, sources told Bloomberg‚Äôs Alberto Nardelli and Jorge Valero. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic left the meeting with little clarity on the U.S. stance and is struggling to determine the American side‚Äôs aims after having met for about two hours with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, people familiar with the discussions are reported to have said.

2025-04-17 16:11:27,Nvidia's Top Exec in Beijing Amid Rising U.S.-China Chip Tensions,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Chief ExecutiveJensen Huanglanded in Beijing this week for a series of meetings with Chinese officials and tech leaders, amid ongoing U.S. curbs on AI chip shipments to China. Huang's visit comes shortly after new U.S. export restrictions requiring licenses for the sale of the company's H20 chips to China, a move that could cut up to $5.5 billion in potential revenue for the semiconductor firm. The rules have created uncertainty for Chinese clients awaiting deliveries of Nvidia's advanced processors. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The trip was made at the request of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a state-linked business organization. During his stay, Huang met with government representatives including Vice Premier He Lifeng, as well as executives from companies such as DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK), a local generative AI start-up. According to people familiar with the itinerary cited by the Financial Times, discussions focused on designing new chips that align with current U.S. regulations while serving China's growing AI market. Huang described China as a very important market, expressing optimism about continued cooperation despite rising trade tensions.

2025-04-17 16:12:17,Nvidia's CEO went to China and promised to 'unswervingly serve the Chinese market',"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile trip to Beijing this week following a sudden U.S. government move to block exports of the company‚Äôs H20 AI chips to China, The New York Times (NYT)reported. The H20 ‚Äî a chip Nvidia specifically designed to comply with earlier export restrictions ‚Äî had become central to the company‚Äôs China strategy. But the policy reversal triggered a projected $5.5 billion revenue hit and a nearly 7% drop in Nvidia‚Äôs stock price as of Wednesday. Shares are down nearly 3% on Thursday. While in Beijing, Huang met with Chinese trade officials from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. According to Chinese state media, he emphasized Nvidia‚Äôs commitment to the market, saying the company would ‚Äúspare no effort‚Äù to build compliant products and ‚Äúunswervingly serve the Chinese market.‚Äù Back in Washington, however, Nvidia is facing rising scrutiny. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia‚Äôs chip sales across Asia, with a focus on whether the company violated export rules ‚Äî particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which reportedly stockpiled tens of thousands of advanced chips. As Wedbush Securities put it in a note Thursday morning, Nvidia and U.S. tech are now ‚Äúcaught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.‚Äù The firm called the chip ban the ‚Äúfirst shots fired‚Äù in what could become a long and painful trade war between the U.S. and China. Analysts expect tech companies to offer little guidance this quarter, and Wedbush estimates 2025 forecasts will be cut by 7‚Äì10%. While the near-term financial damage may be considerable, the strategic risk is even greater. China brought in roughly $17 billion for Nvidia last year ‚Äî over 19% of its total revenue. If access to that market evaporates, so does a key growth pillar. And with Washington turning up the heat and Beijing watching closely, Huang‚Äôs balancing act ‚Äî between regulatory compliance and global expansion ‚Äî just got significantly harder.

2025-04-17 16:33:36,"Nvidia & AMD sell-off, Hertz extends gains: Trending Tickers","Wealth hostBrad Smithand Yahoo Finance Senior ReporterAlexandra Canalexamine some of today's trending tickers. The chipmaker sell-off continues, with Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) extending losses sparked by new chip export restrictions that add costs for the company. Hertz (HTZ) extends gains fueled by billionaire investor Bill Ackman's firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, disclosing its large stake in the rental car company. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealthhere. It's now time for some of today's trending tickers. We're watching chip stocks, Nvidia and AMD. Plus we're also watching hurts. Joining me now we've got our very own Alexandra Canal. First up, we got to talk about Nvidia, Ally. Nvidia and AMD, they are falling. They were in the green earlier during today's session on the back of a solid report from TSMC. Now, they're continuing some of that selling that we saw during a brutal trading session on Wednesday. Investors eyeing that $100 level for Nvidia, and it seems like we are just within that parking lot right now here. Uh Ally, as we're taking a look at shares down by about three and a quarter percent for Nvidia right now. Yeah. You know, another 3% decline, $100. That's a psychological level for a lot of investors are thinking, hey, maybe I should be getting into this stock if it's going to continue this down tick. Now, for a company like Nvidia, there's been a lot of headwinds, right? We constantly have been talking about this uncertainty with trade with tariffs. Nvidia has promised to, you know, do domestic manufacturing. They've uh CEO Jensen Wong has had dinners with President Trump, visited the White House. There was a lot of thinking that Nvidia would be exempt from some of these tariffs. Clearly that did not happen, which is why we're seeing shares sell off uh today, continuing that sell-off that we saw on Wednesday. Uh if we take a look at that 52-week range, we're right in the middle there. But year to date, we are down about 25%, which is just astonishing, considering this was a name that really led stocks higher over the past two years and now we're seeing them uh seeing shares at least do the exact opposite here. So I think the next catalyst, if we don't hear anything else on the trade front in terms of greater clarity, it's going to be that earnings report. Strategists have said Nvidia could go the way of United Airlines, maybe giving two different types of guidance. One a solid guidance, then maybe one adjusting for a lot of the uncertainties or at least what we know at this point. But certainly a big company that we constantly talk about. It's just hard to really know what the future holds when there's just so many unknowns out there right now. Yeah. Well, one thing that I'm looking to take my cues from right now at least is the options market. Based on options contracts, it seems like by the time we see this next earnings print, May 28th is that timing for Nvidia, we could see a move to the upside or downside by about 15.3% as is priced in by options contracts right now. So that is something to keep an eye on here. Also, we're keeping an eye on shares of hurts. Hurts shares extending gains, bringing the two-day jump in the stock to around 100%. This is on the back of the news that billionaire Bill Ackman's hedge fund is now one of the top shareholders in the rental car company. Pershing Square Capital disclosing it's acquired nearly 13 million shares of hurts stock. Shares of hurts higher on today by about 24%. This adds on to the move that we had seen yesterday as well. Crazy. Two days of double digit gains. Year to date, this stock is up 100%. Now hurts, it was the original meme stock back in the time of the pandemic. They filed for bankruptcy, then they doubled down on their EV fleet. They purchased around 100,000 Teslas that ultimately did not pay off, as if you're a renter for a car, you probably don't want to get an EV if you're planning to travel far because the infrastructure is just not there yet. There were a lot of concerns over charging stations. So that ended up being a bust. Uh the fact that Pershing Square uh capital's coming in, they often take activist positions, so investors optimistic about that. Now, this is a company where we talk about a lot of the companies that maybe aren't doing so well from the tariffs. This is one that could actually benefit because of car prices are going to go higher, perhaps buyers will explore the rental market a little more closely. So that that's something that we could continue to watch to see if there's any boon potentially there for a company like hurts. So, uh just a crazy stock, but again, remember, meme-like qualities, fundamentals a little shaky. Uh we'll see though if Bill Ackman can get the job done. It'll be interesting to see as well of Hertz starts marketing some of, because some of the rental car companies out there, they also offload some of the vehicles that they have when they're looking to retire them from their fleet. So that's also another used car sale input. And if they start marketing them as tariff free, uh go in the way of some of the other auto manufacturers, we'll see what that does for. Huge rental.",News,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-amd-sell-off-hertz-153336212.html?.tsrc=rss,4

The deposit rate was decreased by a quarter-point to 2.25%, as predicted by almost all analysts polled by Bloomberg. European stocks weakened. On Wednesday, Powell indicated he was taking a wait-and-see approach on tariffs, pushing back on hopes the central bank would act quickly to soothe investor fears. His comments, along with concerns over the impact of levies on the tech sector, helped end a two-day consolidation in stocks. ‚ÄúThe only ‚ÄòFed put‚Äô that the Fed could envisage is if there was a risk of market dislocation, which is not the case at the moment,‚Äù said Enguerrand Artaz, a fund manager at La Financi√®re de l‚ÄôEchiquier. ‚ÄúWhen you look at the data, there is no need to intervene. Markets going down is not a reason in itself to intervene, especially not at these levels of valuation.‚Äù In earnings news, UnitedHealth Group Inc. plunged after the company cut its earnings outlook for the year and reported first-quarter earnings below estimates. Shares in other health insurers tumbled. TSMC‚Äôs US-listed shares rose after the main chipmaker for Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. forecast sales for the second quarter that beat analyst estimates. Elsewhere, Eli Lilly & Co. soared on positive data from a weight-loss pill study. On the trade front, the US and Japan kicked off negotiations with an aim to reach a deal as soon as possible, top Japan negotiator Ryosei Akazawa said. Preparations are underway for a second round of discussions later this month, he said. Countries are racing to negotiate deals with the US to avert high import taxes Trump imposed ‚Äî and then quickly paused ‚Äî on about 60 trading partners. That move put a 24% across-the-board tariff on Japanese imports on hold, though a 10% baseline charge still applies ‚Äî as well as 25% levies on cars, steel and aluminum. ‚ÄúThe trajectory of US-Japan trade talks will continue to be closely monitored, not just for their bilateral implications, but also as a potential framework for how the US may approach trade relationships with other allies,‚Äù said Rajeev De Mello, a global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management. In commodities, gold hit a record earlier Thursday on demand for havens, before turning lower as risk sentiment improved. Oil rose for a second day after the US vowed to reduce Iran‚Äôs energy exports to zero.

2025-04-17 16:59:27,The One Stock Behind the Dow's 500-Point Plunge Thursday,"TheDow Jones Industrial Averagefell about 500 points, or 1.3%, near midday Thursday and there was one stock that bore most of the blame: UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Shares of UnitedHealth plummeted more than 20% after the health insurercut its full-year earnings forecast, citing higher-than-expected costs. Meanwhile, more than two-thirds of the 30 stocks in the blue-chip Dow, one of the most commonly cited measures of U.S. stock market performance, were trading higher. TheS&P 500was up 0.3% at the same time and theNasdaq Composite‚Äîusually much more volatile than the Dow due to its preponderance of growth stocks‚Äîwas marginally lower afteryesterday's sell-off. The Dow's dramatic underperformance on Thursday was a clear reflection of the index's unique methodology. The Dow isprice-weighted, meaning the stocks with the highest share prices have the most influence on the index's performance. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, on the other hand, arecapitalization-weighted indexesthat are more influenced by the companies with the highest market values, not the highest share prices. UnitedHealth Group, with a closing price of $585.04 yesterday, was the highest-priced stock in the Dow and thus its most influential component. Goldman Sachs (GS), which closed at $499.05 yesterday, is the only Dow stock with a share price within $100 of UnitedHealth's. (With UnitedHealth‚Äôs losses on Thursday, Goldman could finish the week as the Dow's heftiest stock.) Apple (AAPL), with a closing price of $194.27 yesterday, has a fraction of UnitedHealth's influence within the Dow. But the iPhone maker has 15 billion shares, and thus a market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion. UnitedHealth‚Äôs approximately 900 million shares put its market cap at Wednesday's close at $535 billion, meaning Apple stock has more than 5 times the weight in the S&P 500. To be sure, UnitedHealth, the S&P 500's 14th-largest company heading into Thursday‚Äîstill has a massive amount of influence within the S&P 500. The selection committee that picks stocks for the Dow is cognizant of its peculiarities. Its price-weighted methodology, according to S&P Global, ""has meant, over the years, that extremely high-priced stocks have not been included in The Dow.""Investors often speculate that companies with high share pricessplit their stockin part to increase their chances of joining the Dow. In recent years,Amazon(AMZN) andNvidia(NVDA) have both been added to the Dow in relatively short order aftersplittingtheirstocks, which had been trading at more than $1,000 per share. The Dow isn't the only index susceptible to hazardous imbalance. Earlier this year, theMagnificent Seven‚ÄîApple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)‚Äîaccounted for about one-third of the S&P 500, an extreme level of concentration thatset off some investors' alarm bells.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/the-one-stock-behind-the-dow-s-500-point-plunge-thursday-11717138,3

Nvidia said ina regulatory filinglate Tuesday night that it would take a $5.5 billion hit in the first quarter due to the ban on sales of its H20 chips made specifically for the Chinese market to comply with ever-tightening US trade rules. The stock's drop on Thursday put Nvidia's market cap at just under $2.5 trillion, meaning the company has shed more than $250 billion since the tighter trade rules were disclosed. Read more:Is the stock market closed on Good Friday? 10 market holidays in 2025 and 2026. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur said in a note late Wednesday afternoon that he estimates the change would reduce Nvidia's full-year data center revenue and earnings per share by 8% to 10%. In other words, Nvidia would see $15 billion to $16 billion in lost revenue. Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis predicted a more modest $10 billion hit to revenue. The chip trade curbs from the Trump administration took Wall Street by surprise, givena recent report from NPR that Trump had backed off its plans to restrict Nvidia's H20 chipsfollowing a dinner with CEO Jensen Huang at Mar-a-Lago. Nvidia declined to comment on the matter. Just two days after the company's disclosure on Tuesday, Huang traveled to Beijing at the invitation of a domestic trade group,Bloomberg reported Thursday. Earlier this week, Nvidia said it willproduce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructurein the US within the next four years as the tech industry looks to bolster its domestic manufacturing footprint in the face ofTrump's aggressive approach to trade policy.

2025-04-17 17:36:39,Forbes Recession Tracker: IMF Says Trade War Will Stifle Growth But Not Lead To Recession,"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline Fears of a sharp economic downturn due to President Donald Trump‚Äôs ever-changing tariff policies are pervading Wall Street, as some of the most trusted observers of the economy say the U.S. is far from able to declare victory on a tariff-driven recession, though the head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday the border-spanning organization does not project such a downturn this year. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, economic forecasts have been a rollercoaster.Getty Images  Key Facts   Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the United Nations agency IMF, said Thursday the fund made ‚Äúnotable markdowns‚Äù to its global economic growth forecasts due to trade disruptions, though it still does not predict a recession, while warning the ‚Äúhigh uncertainty raises the risk of financial market stress.‚Äù    Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday his bank‚Äôs baseline economic forecast does not call for a recession this year, but other big banks‚Äô economic models still indicate the chance of a recession this year remains a tossup: Morgan Stanley forecasts 40% odds, Goldman Sachs places 45% likelihood of a recession over the next year and JPMorgan Chase projects a 60% chance.    National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business' on Monday he is ‚Äú100% not‚Äù expecting a recession in 2025, explaining recent discussions with CEOs indicated the ‚Äúuncertainty over tariffs‚Äù won‚Äôt be ‚Äúa big drag‚Äù on the economy.    Though the Trump administration‚Äôs backdown last week from its most aggressive tariffs alleviated concerns the U.S. was on the cusp of a recession, Hassett‚Äôs confidence is far from a consensus view among Wall Street bigwigs and prominent economists.   Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said in a Sunday interview with NBC News: ‚ÄúRight now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession, and I‚Äôm worried about something worse than a recession if this isn‚Äôt handled well.‚Äù   Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary during President Bill Clinton‚Äôs term, said in a Monday editorial podcast in The New York Times he believes it‚Äôs ‚Äúsix in 10 or better that a recession will start this year,‚Äù explaining: ‚ÄúThe pause is certainly better than if we had simply charged along on the catastrophic path that we‚Äôre on, but anybody who thinks the genie is back in the bottle and that it‚Äôs all now OK should reconsider their position.‚Äù   Last week, Summers predicted such a downturn would leave an additional 2 million Americans unemployed, a more than 28% increase from the 7.1 million unemployed Americans in March, and a $5,000 or greater decline in annual household income.   Moody's Analytics Mark Zandi said Monday on ‚ÄúCNN News Central‚Äù he sees the U.S. sinking into a recession over the next ‚Äúthree, four‚Äù weeks if the policy uncertainty is still ‚Äúvery thick,‚Äù saying he hopes ‚Äúthe president and the administration kind of finds an off ramp here and the trade war de-escalates.‚Äù     Bank Of America Survey Finds Investors‚Äô Economic Growth Expectations At 3-Decade Low Some 42% of big money managers now expect as of April‚Äîthe fourth-highest monthly reading of the last two decades for Bank of America‚Äôs April fund manager survey, which also found the 82% of respondents expect weaker global economic growth, the highest reading in 30 years. The closely watched poll was conducted among 195 managers of an aggregate $444 billion assets under management April 4-10, the week after Trump announced his country-by-country tariffs. Crucial Quote ‚ÄúThe prospect of a recession has increased,‚Äù Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a Monday earnings call. ‚ÄúOur clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors are concerned by the significant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions,‚Äù continued Solomon.  News Peg Corporate earnings season is underway, which should better reveal the health of the economy during the first three months of 2025. United Airlines took a rarely seen step this week of issuing a pair of profit forecasts, one in the case of a recession, and one in the case of more stable growth. ‚ÄúA single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the Company‚Äôs expectation has become bimodal ‚Äì either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession,‚Äù the company wrote in a regulatory filing. Gold And Oil Prices Hint At Potential Global Slowdowngold And Oil Prices Hint At Potential Global Slowdown Trading in two of the world‚Äôs most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 10% this year to a record $3,300 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. ‚ÄúAlong with simmering geopolitical tensions, gold is benefiting from worries that higher tariffs will kindle inflation,‚Äù Solita Marcelli, UBS Global Wealth Management‚Äôs chief investment officer Americas, wrote in a Wednesday note to clients, setting a $3,500 per troy ounce price target for the precious metal. Jamie Dimon‚Äôs Recession Warnings Influenced Trump‚Äôs Pause In a Wednesday morning interview just hours before Trump paused many of the more than 10% country-by-country levies, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told ‚ÄúMornings With Maria‚Äù he believed a tariff-spurred recession is ‚Äúprobably‚Äù a ‚Äúlikely outcome,‚Äù adding he‚Äôs heard ‚Äúrecessionary talk‚Äù in conversations with other business leaders. Trump said the comments from Dimon, the head of the nation‚Äôs largest bank by assets and market value, partially inspired his pause. Economists at JPMorgan had labeled Trump‚Äôs policies as the ‚Äúlargest tax increase‚Äù since 1968 which will ‚Äúfall heavily on the US consumer.‚Äù In JPMorgan‚Äôs earnings call Friday, Dimon repeated his pushback against Trump‚Äôs targeting of allies in his trade war, explaining the ‚Äúmost important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically.‚Äù Stock Market Signals Slowdown Fears Stock prices don‚Äôt completely correlate with economic growth, but equity investors are clearly pricing still in significantly increased odds of a down stretch for the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 briefly dove into a 20% bear market last week, wiping out about $10 trillion in market value, led by stocks considered the most vulnerable to a slowdown, including artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla. But markets are still pricing ‚Äúnowhere close to the worst case‚Äù scenario, Bhanu Baweja, UBS Investment Bank‚Äôs chief strategist, said last Monday. Even after the post-pause recovery, the S&P is still down 14% from its February peak.  Trump Administration Prepared Americans For The Possibility Of A Recession Ahead of the ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù announcement last week, Trump braced Americans for a possible recession. In a Fox News interview aired March 9, he would not rule out the possibility of a recession, cautioning Americans for a period of economic ‚Äútransition‚Äù as his policies take hold and noting he‚Äôs paying little attention to stock market losses. In subsequent media appearances, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent similarly declined to dismiss a potential recession and said the U.S. will go through a ‚Äúdetox period.‚Äù Bessent told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù in an interview he believes it ‚Äúwould have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes‚Äù on ahead of the Great Recession. ‚ÄúBe Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!,‚Äù Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Monday. What Needs To Happen To Gdp To Trigger A Recession (it‚Äôs Not Negative‚Äîyet) The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, a comprehensive measure of all goods and services produced in a country. The official quarterly GDP stats haven't turned negative yet, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve's real-time model ignited concerns by calling for -1.8% annual GDP growth in 2025's first quarter, which would be the worst reading since 2020‚Äîthough the estimate is likely skewed by its methodology, including how it accounts for a surge in gold imports. Bond Market Is Shaky‚Äîbut Yield Curve‚Äôs Still Intact Elsewhere in financial markets, a flight to government-issued debt is evidence of a thirst for safer returns in the face of a potential recession, as yields for benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds have dropped by 40 basis points over the past three months (lower yields mean bonds got more valuable). But the most common bond market signal of a recession, the inversion of the yield curve, in which longer-term bonds have lower yields than shorter-dated ones, has actually normalized in recent months. The New York Fed‚Äôs bond-linked recession model calls for just 30% recession odds over the next year, down from the more than 70% odds in late 2023, a period which failed to materialize into a full-blown recession. Consumer Confidence Signals Americans Bracing For Tough Times Perhaps the most concerning signal over the last is a breakdown in everyday Americans‚Äô conviction in the economy, as the Conference Board‚Äôs closely watched consumer confidence survey tumbled this month to its lowest level since 2021. That tracks with weaker spending, as February retail sales grew by just 0.2% from January to February, according to a report released March 17 by the Census Bureau, far worse than the 0.6% month-over-month increase projected by economists. Unemployment Rate Is Still Fine One of the most important hallmarks of the American economy, the labor market has shown some cracks in early 2025 as job creation slowed and layoffs spiked, but remains overwhelmingly strong, as March‚Äôs 4.2% unemployment rate sits well within the healthy historic norm. A key labor market recession indicator, the Sahm rule, flashes a far lower likelihood of a recession than it did when it peaked last summer, inspiring a short-lived market selloff in August. What To Watch For Trading in two of the world‚Äôs most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 10% this year to a record $3,200 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. What To Watch For Bessent and Trump have made clear they are lasered in on lowering interest rates, which are determined by the politically independent Fed. Typically, rates are only drastically cut during periods of economic distress, as lower rates typically stimulate economic growth as households and businesses are more likely to borrow with lower interest costs, though that uptick in loan activity can simultaneously lead to higher inflation as demand rises. The Fed is likely to hold off on further rate cuts ‚Äúuntil tariff policy becomes clearer,‚Äù according to David Mericle, Goldman‚Äôs chief U.S. economist.

Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Va., found that Google violated antitrust laws by ""willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power"" in both the market for publishers selling ad space and the ad exchange market that connects buyers and sellers.The U.S. Department of Justice failed to prove that Google operated a monopoly in advertiser ad networks, Brinkema said. The court will set a briefing schedule to determine ""remedies"" for the antitrust violations, which the DOJ has argued should include a divestiture of Google Ad Manager, which houses both the tech giant's publisher ad server and its ad exchange business. The DOJ also has pushed for Google tosell its Chrome browserafter a federal judge ruled last year that the company also holds an illegal monopoly over the web search market. A trial to determine whether Google will have to sell Chrome, or simply make it easier for companies to use other search engines, is set to begin next Monday. ""We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,"" Google Vice President, Regulatory Affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said.

2025-04-17 19:05:31,How Much Your 2024 Tax Refund Would Be Worth Today If You Invested It In the S&P 500,"Tax season and the potential of a tax refund often bring a much-needed boost to many people's finances. They can receive thousands of tax dollars back depending on their incomes, deductions, and credits. Using that money for short-term expenses is common, but there may be a better way to make the most of it. What if you had invested last year's refund instead of spending it? What if you had invested it in SPY? The average federaltax refundwas $3,050 as of March 29, 2024.Refunds are typically issued when people overpay their taxes throughout the year via withholding or estimated tax payments.Tax credits and deductionsfurther influence the final amount of the refund. Tax deductions subtract from your taxable income. Tax credits subtract directly from what you owe the IRS. A refund can be a sizeable check for many that they can put toward paying down debt or making a purchase. It can also provide a unique opportunity to invest for future growth. SPY is anexchange-traded fund (ETF)that tracks the performance of theS&P 500, which includes 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the country. It allows investors to gain exposure to a broad range of sectors and industries within the stock market through a single investment. The stock market can fluctuate in the short term, but the S&P 500 has consistently risen over the long term. SPY typically offers an annual return of 7% to 10%. The S&P 500 delivered a 10-year total return of 182.9% as of February 2025. ""If someone received a $3,050 tax refund and invested it into an index such as SPY late last March, say the 31st, their investment would have grown by about 5% to $3,302,"" saidNicole Burdick, LPL Financial Advisor and founder of Money Maven Financial. ""However, if they had done the same thing on March 31, 2022, they would have lost at least 11%, leaving them with $2,714. The stock market tends to deliver results for long-term investors but can be a tricky place to park money if you‚Äôre counting on an immediate return,"" she said. You can use this formula to calculate the growth orfuture valueof an investment:Initial Investment x (1 + Rate of Return) = Future Value. Investing your tax refund in SPY can offer numerous benefits but this might not be the move for everyone. You may want to consider a few things before investing your refund. ""The main question to ask is when do you plan to use this money? If you plan to use it in the next one to three years, you‚Äôll want to keep it safe and liquid, like in a high-yield savings account. If your timeframe is longer, you may choose to invest your funds in something that aligns with when you need the money and how much risk you‚Äôre comfortable taking,"" Burdick recommended. ""Investing your tax refund in SPY can provide potential growth and dividends but it carries risk for the short-term. When you get your refund, start by asking yourself what the best use of that money is. You may find it makes more sense to pay down debt or beef up your emergency savings,"" Burdick said. Investing your tax refund is a strategic way to grow your wealth over time. Instead of spending it immediately, consider investing it in options like SPY. Even a modest refund can experience significant growth so it could be worth the risk. You're not only taking a step toward securing financial growth for the future but also building a foundation for achieving your long-term goals.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/the-average-tax-refund-in-2024-heres-what-it-would-be-if-invested-11701004,3

Recent comments from the company‚Äôs CEO during the Q4 2025 earnings call have brought the company's close relationships with key customers into sharper focus, raising questions about prior awareness of product-related challenges. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased Semtech securities and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Aug. 27, 2024 ‚Äì Feb. 7, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Apr. 22, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/smtc Contact the Firm Now: SMTC@hbsslaw.com ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†844-916-0895 Semtech‚Äôs Customer Relationships at Center of CopperEdge Delayed Ramp: The lawsuit, Kleovoulos v. Semtech Corporation, et al., centers on claims that Semtech misled investors about the readiness and projected ramp-up of CopperEdge, a critical component for advanced data center interconnects. During the March 13, 2025, earnings call, CEO Hong Hou acknowledged delays, stating, ""We are disappointed that the expected volume ramp would not materialize for FY ‚Äô26 due to rack architecture changes as we previously announced.‚Äù Crucially, CEO Hou also highlighted the company's extensive collaboration with potential and ""anchor"" customers. ‚ÄúWe remain engaged with over 20 potential customers, including hyperscalers, switch makers and the cable suppliers,‚Äù Hou stated. ""Lastly, based on continued collaboration with our anchor customer [reportedly Nvidia], we expect our CopperEdge portfolio to be included in their future generation rack designs."" The Pending Semtech Securities Class Action CEO Hou‚Äôs acknowledgement of close collaboration, specifically regarding ""rack designs,"" has drawn attention in light of the lawsuit's claims that Semtech failed to disclose necessary rack architecture changes. The suit, filed in the Central District of California, claims the company overstated the product's market readiness and projected ramp-up timeline. The complaint alleges claims on behalf of investors who purchased Semtech securities between August 27, 2024, and February 7, 2025. During this period, Semtech allegedly promoted its CopperEdge portfolio, designed for 400G and 800G data center applications using copper cable and backplane interconnects, asserting it provided ""valuable solutions"" to meet customer demands. The complaint alleges Semtech made ""false and misleading statements"" by failing to disclose key information. Specifically, the suit contends the CopperEdge products did not meet the needs of a key server rack customer, required significant rack architecture modifications, and would not achieve the previously forecast fiscal 2026 ramp-up. The revelation of these issues on February 7, 2025, triggered a sharp market reaction. Semtech disclosed that CopperEdge sales would not ""ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026"" due to ""feedback from a server rack customer,"" ""discussions with end users,"" and the need for ""certain rack architecture changes."" The company further revised its sales projections, indicating CopperEdge revenue would fall below the previously stated $50 million floor. The market‚Äôs response was immediate and severe. On February 10, 2025, Semtech‚Äôs stock price plunged by more than 30%, resulting in a loss of over $1.4 billion in market capitalization in a single trading day, according to market data. The lawsuit seeks damages for investors who suffered losses as a result of the alleged misrepresentations. ‚ÄúThe CEO‚Äôs statements regarding close customer collaboration suggest a need for thorough investigation into the timeline of information sharing between Semtech and its customers,‚Äù said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

2025-04-17 21:49:01,The One Stock Behind the Dow's Steep Drop Thursday,"TheDow Jones Industrial Averagefell more than 500 points, or 1.3%, on Thursday, and one stock bore most of the blame: UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Shares of UnitedHealth plummeted more than 22% after the health insurercut its full-year earnings forecast, citing higher-than-expected costs. Meanwhile, more than two-thirds of the 30 stocks in the blue-chip Dow, one of the most commonly cited measures of U.S. stock market performance, closed higher Thursday. TheS&P 500was up 0.13% at the same time and theNasdaq Composite‚Äîusually much more volatile than the Dow due to its preponderance of growth stocks‚Äîwas marginally lower afteryesterday's sell-off. The Dow's dramatic underperformance on Thursday was a clear reflection of the index's unique methodology. The Dow isprice-weighted, meaning the stocks with the highest share prices have the most influence on the index's performance. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, on the other hand, arecapitalization-weighted indexesthat are more influenced by the companies with the highest market values, not the highest share prices. UnitedHealth Group, with a closing price of $585.04 yesterday, was the highest-priced stock in the Dow and thus its most influential component. Goldman Sachs (GS), which closed at $499.05 yesterday, is the only Dow stock with a share price within $100 of UnitedHealth's. (With UnitedHealth‚Äôs losses on Thursday, Goldman could finish the week as the Dow's heftiest stock.) Apple (AAPL), with a closing price of $194.27 yesterday, has a fraction of UnitedHealth's influence within the Dow. But the iPhone maker has 15 billion shares, and thus a market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion. UnitedHealth‚Äôs approximately 900 million shares put its market cap at Wednesday's close at $535 billion, meaning Apple stock has more than 5 times the weight in the S&P 500. To be sure, UnitedHealth, the S&P 500's 14th-largest company heading into Thursday‚Äîstill has a massive amount of influence within the S&P 500. The selection committee that picks stocks for the Dow is cognizant of its peculiarities. Its price-weighted methodology, according to S&P Global, ""has meant, over the years, that extremely high-priced stocks have not been included in The Dow.""Investors often speculate that companies with high share pricessplit their stockin part to increase their chances of joining the Dow. In recent years,Amazon(AMZN) andNvidia(NVDA) have both been added to the Dow in relatively short order aftersplittingtheirstocks, which had been trading at more than $1,000 per share. The Dow isn't the only index susceptible to hazardous imbalance.

After fluctuating for much of the day, the Nasdaq closed 0.1% lower. Eli Lilly (LLY) shares notched the S&P 500's top daily performance, surging 14.4% after the pharmaceutical giant releasedpromising results from a clinical trialof its experimental oral weight-loss treatment. According to Lilly, the first in a series of Phase 3 trials revealed that orforglipron was more effective than a placebo at causing weight loss and reducing A1C, a long-term gauge of blood sugar levels. The company expects to seek Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval next year for orforglipron as a type 2 diabetes treatment. Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares added 8.1% on Thursday. The stock trended higher in April, and analysts suggested that the discount retailer could be poised for strength amid the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. For instance, Citiupgraded Dollar Tree stock last week, suggesting that the company could emerge as an unlikely beneficiary of broadly applied tariffs, with flexibility to raise prices without deterring too many customers and a track record of success during previous downturns. Crude oil futures prices pushed higher for the second straight day after the U.S. announced additional sanctions targeting Iran's oil business. The uptick in oil prices helped lift a variety of oil and gas stocks. Shares of exploration and production firm Diamondback Energy (FANG) gained 5.7%, while shares of oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) advanced 5.1%. Shares of UnitedHealth plummeted 22.4% after the insurance giant reported lower-than-expected sales and profits for the first quarter.¬†It was the heaviest decline in the Dow and the S&P 500. The company alsoreduced its full-year profit guidance. Other health insurance stocks also lost ground, with shares of Humana (HUM) falling 7.4%. Snap-On (SNA) shares sank 8.0% after the maker of hand tools and other professional equipmentmissed quarterly sales and profit estimates. The company noted that the macroeconomic environment weighed on its performance, with the uncertain outlook making customers more reluctant to purchase financed goods. Global Payments (GPN)¬†agreed toacquire rival payment processing firm Worldpayfrom current stakeholders Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and private equity firm GTCR.

UnitedHealth‚Äôs slump erased about $120 billion off itsmarket capitalization, which puts it among the costliest stock routs of all time. It‚Äôs the kind of wealth-decimating drop that‚Äôs rarely seen outside of the tech sector, where corporate valuations are underpinned by growth expectations that can balloon and, in moments of crisis, pop.¬†Meta (META), for example, became the first company to lose more than $100 billion in a single day in 2018 after the company‚Äîthen called Facebook‚Äîreported disappointing quarterly revenue. Indefensive sectorslike health care and consumer staples, companies usually lose that kind of market value over long periods of slow decline. Pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and cosmetics giant Est√©e Lauder (EL), for example, have each lost about $100 billion in value over the last 10 and 3 years, respectively, as they‚Äôve struggled with slumping sales. To be sure, UnitedHealth, with a $535 billion market cap, was the 14th largest company in the S&P 500 heading into Thursday‚Äôs session, giving it lots of market value to lose. Outside of the tech sector, only Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Eli Lilly (LLY), Walmart (WMT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Visa (V) were worth more before Thursday.

2025-04-17 23:16:52,Netflix Stock Climbs as Profits Exceed Expectations,"Netflix (NFLX) reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts‚Äô expectations, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The streaming giant's revenue grew over 12% year-over-year to $10.54 billion, above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income of $2.89 billion, or $6.61 per share, rose from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier, beating Wall Street‚Äôs projections.¬†The period marked the first quarter Netflix did not report subscriber numbers. Netflix shares rose about 3% in after-hours trading. They were up 9% for 2025 so far through Thursday‚Äôs close. The better-than-expected results came in part due to higher subscription and ad revenues, the company said, along with the timing of expenses. Netflix hadraised prices for its plans in January, hiking its ad-supported plan to $7.99 from $6.99 per month, the standard ad-free plan to $17.99 from $15.49 a month, and its premium plan to $24.99 from $22.99 a month. Netflix maintained its fiscal 2025 revenue projection of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion. Analysts on average had expected $44.27 billion. The company's second-quarter revenue forecast of $11.04 billion exceeded Wall Street's estimate of $10.91 billion. Co-CEO Greg Peters said Netflix expects to double its advertising revenue this year, as the company rolls out its ad tech suite. The suite is live in the U.S. and Canada, with 10 other markets expected in the months to come. Earlier this week, Netflix executives reportedly said their goal isto doublethe company‚Äôs $39 billion in revenue last year by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion.

2025-04-18 03:50:21,"Figure AI Shakes Silicon Valley With USD39.5B Valuation, 200,000 Robots Promised By 2029, Beating Out Tesla, SpaceX And OpenAI","Figure AI, a young robotics startup led by serial entrepreneur Brett Adcock, is shaking up Silicon Valley. The company, which promises to revolutionize industries with autonomous robots, is seeking to raise USD1.5 billion at a jaw-dropping USD39.5 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

Founded in 2022, Figure AI set its sights high from the start. Adcock, who previously launched Vettery and Archer Aviation, began by hiring top robotics experts and raising USD70 million in venture capital. In 2023, the company revealed its first humanoid robot, sparking early buzz in the tech community. 

Bloomberg reported that last year, Figure AI announced a massive USD675 million funding round at a USS2.6 billion valuation, attracting investments from Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, and billionaire Jeff Bezos' private firm. 

According to the Journal, Bezos even visited the company's facility, fueling speculation about a potential partnership with Amazon. Talks eventually fell through, but momentum around Figure AI kept growing. 

The major breakthrough came with BMW. Figure's robots are now being tested inside BMW's South Carolina factory. As of this month, multiple humanoid robots are active on-site, performing tasks like picking up and grasping metal sheets, the Journal reported. A BMW announcement confirmed the news, explaining that the robots initially practiced during nonproduction hours and have since transitioned to live-production scenarios. 

Adcock has been vocal about the company's progress. In a Mar 31 social media post featuring the robots at work, he wrote, ""This isn't a test - this is what autonomous robots in production operations look like. Turn the music up!"" 

Figure's ambitions are enormous. The company's documents forecast more than 200,000 robots deployed across factories and homes by 2029, generating USD9 billion in revenue. Such lofty goals are rare for hardware startups, especially considering Figure AI reported no revenue last year and only has a few dozen robots built so far. 

Despite the gap between vision and reality, investor interest has exploded. On Mar 24, Adcock posted that Figure had become the ""#1 most sought-after private stock in the secondary market,"" outranking giants like SpaceX and OpenAI. 

One of the biggest players in the current funding push is Align Ventures. The firm has been working to pool smaller investors.

Still, the excitement around Figure AI continues to build. Adcock's ability to rally capital, attract major investors, and secure a partnership with BMW positions the company as a key player in the race to bring autonomous robots to everyday life. 

While challenges remain, Figure AI is aggressively scaling its efforts. The company is reportedly exploring expansion into logistics and warehousing applications, aiming to broaden the use of its robots beyond automotive factories. Whether Figure AI delivers on its bold promises remains to be seen, but for now, Silicon Valley is watching closely.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1k1vs49/figure_ai_shakes_silicon_valley_with_usd395b/,5
2025-04-18 04:27:15,Watch These Netflix Price Levels as Stock Jumps After Strong Earnings,"Netflix (NFLX) shares jumped in extended trading Thursday after the streaming giantposted first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, boosted by higher subscription prices and ad revenues. Through Thursday's close, Netflix shares have gained 9% since the start of the year and trade nearly 60% higher over the past 12 months as the company continues to grow its advertising sales andlive eventscontent. Analysts have also touted Netflix‚Äôs ability to withstand an economic downturn amid uncertainty related to tariffs, with JPMorgandescribing it as the ‚Äúmost resilient‚Äù companyit tracks. Netflix has alsoattracted attentionfor its attempt to double its revenue and achieve a market capitalization of $1 trillion by 2030, which theWall Street Journalreported earlier this week. Below, we take a closer look at Netflix‚Äôsweekly chartand applytechnical analysisto point out key price levels worth watching. After setting theirrecord highin February, Netflix shares retraced as much as 23% before bulls stepped in to support the stock last week near the 50-week moving average. It‚Äôs worth noting that the rebound coincided with therelative strength index (RSI)moving higher from the 50 threshold, a reading that has marked the bottom of several priorpullbacksin the stock since early 2023. More recently, the shares continued to gain momentum leading into the streamer‚Äôs quarterly results, with the price set to open around thepsychological $1,000 levelon Monday morning. (U.S. markets areclosed Fridayin commemoration of Good Friday.) Let‚Äôs identify two key overhead areas on Netflix‚Äôs chart that investors may be watching and also point out importantsupport levelsto monitor during retracements. Netflix shares rose 3.5% to around $1,007 in after-hours trading Thursday. The first overhead area to keep tabs on sits at $1,065. Investors who bought shares during the pullback could decide to place sell orders near the stock‚Äôsall-time high (ATH). We can project anupsidetarget to watch above the ATH by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes priortrendsto forecast future directional movements. When applying the tool to Netflix‚Äôs chart, we take the price bars comprising the stock‚Äôs trend higher from August to December last year and overlay them from this month‚Äôs low. The analysis forecasts a target of around $1,300, about 34% above Thursday‚Äôs closing price. The earlier trend played out over 17 weeks before the stockconsolidated, indicating a similar trending move may last until early August ifprice actionrhymes. During retracements, investors should keep track of the $821 level. A retest of this area could see investors seekentry pointsnear last week‚Äôs low, which also closely aligns with the end of a five-week losing streak in early January. Finally, selling below this level sets the stage for a possible fall to around $697. Netflix shares could encounter support in this region near last year‚Äôs prominent Julyswing highand a period ofsideways drifton the chart between mid-August and late September.

2025-04-18 16:40:22,NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)‚Äôs Growth Outlook Adjusted by UBS Over China Export Restrictions,"We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks Surging on News Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks surging on news today. In the latest efforts to stop China from getting ahead in the AI race, the Trump administration is considering penalties that would block China‚Äôs DeepSeek from buying U.S. technology, reportsThe New York Times.It has also been reported that the administration is currently debating Americans‚Äô access to its services. DeepSeek, a Chinese start-up that shook up Wall Street a few months ago with its cheaper and more efficient AI models, has had the US taking firm steps to tighten controls and scrutinize tech investments. A key focus of US export controls has been Nvidia, whose chips were used to build DeepSeek‚Äôs AI models. Even though the US had stringent export controls, the AI start-up managed to get hold of thousands of its GPUs, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the said controls. As a result, US officials now aim to prevent the most advanced chips from being sold to China to deter it from having a lead in the AI race. READ NOW:12 AI Stocks on Wall Street‚Äôs Radarand10 AI Stocks You Shouldn‚Äôt Overlook Right Now The U.S. House Select Committee on China said that ‚Äúit has sent a formal letter to Nvidia demanding answers about sales to China and Southeast Asia to examine whether and how its chips ended up powering DeepSeek‚Äôs AI models‚Äîdespite U.S. export restrictions‚Äù. With the government tightening its export rules to China, the AI chipmaker has revealed how it would face a $5.5bn (¬£4.2bn) hit in costs. The company will now require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China, one of its most popular chips. ‚ÄúThe [government] indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.‚Äù The company also said that federal officials have advised them that the licence requirement ‚Äúwill be in effect for the indefinite future‚Äù. According to Marc Einstein from the Counterpoint Research consultancy, the $5.5bn hit is in line with estimates. ‚ÄúAs we have seen in the last few days and weeks, this may largely be a negotiating tactic. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see some exemptions or changes made to tariff policy in the near future.‚Äù For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ¬†(see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. One of the most notable analyst calls on Thursday, April 17, was for Nvidia Corporation. UBS reiterated the stock as ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù and cut its price target from $185 to $180. The price target revision comes after the company warned about exporting graphics processing unit chips to China. ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that we are adjusting both revenue and gross margin estimates lower with F2026 (C2025) revs/EPS now $223.5B/$4.86 and F2027 (C2026) revs/EPS now $256.3B/$6.02. Given the cut to C2026 EPS our PT comes down from $185 to $180.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 4thon our list of AI stocks surging on news today. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities usingTipranks' Stock Screener. DEEPSEEK:After theTrumpadministration moved to restrict Nvidia‚Äôs(NVDA) sale of A.I. chips to China, it also is weighing penalties that would block DeepSeek, China‚Äôsartificial intelligencestar, from buying U.S. technology and is debating barring Americans‚Äô access to its services, three people with knowledge of the matter toldThe New York Times‚Äò Tripp Mickle, Ana Swanson, Meaghan Tobin and Cade Metz. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has opened an investigation into Nvidia‚Äôs sale of chips across Asia to assess whether the U.S. chipmaker knowingly provided DeepSeek with critical technology to develop A.I., potentially in violation of U.S. rules, added the report. IRS DIRECT FILE:The Trump administration plans to eliminate the IRS‚Äô Direct File program, an electronic system for filing tax returns directly to the agency for free, according to two people familiar with the decision, Associated Press‚Äôs Fatima Husseinreports. The program developed during Joe Biden‚Äôs presidency was credited by users with making tax filing easy, fast and economical. But Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies complained it was a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use. Publicly traded companies in the space include H&R Block(HRB) and Intuit(INTU). OBSCURE STOCKS:Trading in two obscure New York-listed stocks skyrocketed in the weeks before the companies announced the appointment of Trump family members to their advisory board, the Financial Times‚Äô Paul Caruana Galizia, Ray Douglas and George Steerreport, citing data and regulatory experts. Drone maker Unusual Machines(UMAC) almost tripled in the four weeks leading up to the announcement of Donald Trump Jr.‚Äôs appointment, while fintech group Dominari Holdings(DOMH) rose by 580% in the six weeks before disclosing Trump Jr and Eric Trump had joined its board. Regulatory experts said the timing and scale of the moves, which do nor appear tied to other announcements in the period, were ‚Äúclearly unusual.‚Äù STOCK MANIPULATION:Trump Media and Technology Group(DJT)senta memo to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that states in part, ‚ÄúThis letter serves to inform you of suspicious activity related to a disclosure filed in Germany by the U.K.-based hedge fund Qube Research & Technologies.

Krebs joins a small but growing list of universities and law firms aiming to push back against the president‚Äôs efforts to use the office to attack critics and opponents, the authors note. AUTO TARIFFS:Ford Motor(F) told dealers in a memo penned by a top executive that was obtained byAutomotive Newsthat the company could increase prices on newly built vehicles next month if President Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt ease tariffs on automotive imports, reported Michael Martinez. FEDERAL FUNDING PAUSE:In late January, President Donald Trump paused all awarded federal funds for clean school buses and although the Environmental Protection Agency, which is in charge of distributing the bus funds, has since started to release some of the money, the process has been slow-going and disruptive, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs Zahra Hirji, citing interviews with bus advocates, makers and dealers, and school officials.

2025-04-18 17:27:16,Nvidia and Apple stocks show how investors are firefighting Trump's tariff changes,"Among the ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks, Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) have found themselves at the forefront of Trump's trade war. This week, for better and worse. The two tech stocks' volatility sinceTrump's ""Liberation Day"" reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2is one of the more salient examples of how investors are battling through ever-changing aggressive trade rules from the administration. Apple was initially the biggest loser from the trade rules, with some 90% of its iPhones made in China, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. The companyled Big Tech stocks downin the days following Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2, shedding as much as $773 billion from its market cap. Read more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Atariff exemption for some consumer electronics‚Äî covering basically all of Apple's products ‚Äî announced late last Friday by US Customs and Border Protectionrelieved some pressure on the stock earlier this week, with shares of the iPhone maker rising more than 2% Monday. Apple's recovery helped stem its market cap losses andbriefly put its value back above $3 trillion. Nvidia was less fortunate this week. The company disclosed late Tuesday that the US government has effectively banned exports of its specialized chips to China,sending shares down nearly 7% on Wednesday. Though the AI chipmaker has lost a lower share of its value than Apple since April 2, most of the pain came this week as the company's market cap dropped 8%, or $230 billion. Over that same period, Apple stock was down only fractionally. ""In our view, this recent development heightens investor uncertainty in an already highly-uncertain environment,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in an analysis Wednesday. Trump so far has enacted a 10% tariff on all global imports, which went into effect on April 5. His ""reciprocal"" tariffs initially set to take effect April 9 werepaused for 90 days, with the exception of a145% duty on Chinese imports. More uncertainty lies ahead too. This week, Trump set the stage to tariff semiconductors after news of exemptions for tech products:The Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chipsunder a law that grants the president the ability to impose levies on imports due to national security. And Trump has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs, which could hurt Nvidia, Apple, and other Big Tech firms. ""We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,"" he posted Sunday.

2025-04-18 18:18:47,Nvidia‚Äôs 2025 has been anything but easy. And it‚Äôs going to get tougher.,"It‚Äôs been a difficult 2025 for Nvidia (NVDA) so far. The company, which had a blockbuster 2024, is beset by challenges that have sent its stock price plummeting. Its most recent setback came Tuesday when it disclosed that the Trump administration will require the company toobtain export licenses to sell its H20 chipsto customers in China, effectively banning sales to the country. The announcement means Nvidia will also book a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter related to H20 products and purchase commitments. The announcement comes as President Trump is expected to enact tariffs on semiconductors imported from overseas. The move will also include tariffs on devices like laptops and desktops, which will also impact Nvidia‚Äôs consumer and enterprise gaming and graphics chip sales. Add to that the upcoming AI diffusion export controls that will go into effect in May, which require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of AI chips, and Nvidia is clearly battling some powerful headwinds. And it‚Äôs showing up in its stock price. Shares of Nvidia were down 24% year to date as of late Thursday, and more than 6% over the last five days alone. But there are some bright spots for the company. Its Blackwell chips continue to sell well, and demand will remain strong as tech companies continue to construct data centers to power their AI platforms. But that hasn‚Äôt been enough to calm investors‚Äô concerns. The Trump administration‚Äôs export controls on H20 chips to China follow DeepSeek‚Äôs revelations that it trained its powerful AI models using below top-of-the-line Nvidia chips. The news set off alarms in Washington, which fears that China could use the technologies to strengthen its position in the global AI race and give its military an edge over that of the US. Now Nvidia will have to absorb the cost of H20s initially destined for China. That will not only hit Nvidia‚Äôs bottom line for Q1, but the year ahead as well. China is Nvidia‚Äôs fourth-largest market, accounting for $17.1 billion in sales in the company‚Äôs fiscal 2025. The US is its largest market at $61.2 billion, followed by Singapore ($23.6 billion) and Taiwan ($20.5 billion). It‚Äôs worth noting that Nvidia says Singapore accounts for 18% of sales because customers use it to ‚Äúcentralize invoicing‚Äù and that its products are almost always shipped to other locations. Singapore itself made up just 2% of sales. According to BofA‚Äôs Vivek Arya, the H20 restrictions could result in a 5% to 8% cut to Nvidia‚Äôs fiscal 2026 sales and a 6% to 10% impact on its earnings per share. KeyBanc‚Äôs John Vinh estimated that H20 sales would account for roughly $12 billion in revenue for Nvidia through its fiscal Q3. And while he said he believes Nvidia was able to ship a meaningful amount of H20s ahead of the ban, the restrictions will negatively impact the company‚Äôs revenues. The ban on H20 chips comes despite Nvidia‚Äôs commitment earlier this week tospend $500 billion on AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years, which includes plans to build its Blackwell chips at TSMC‚Äôs plants in Arizona. Beyond the H20 restrictions, Nvidia will soon have todeal with the US's AI diffusion rules. Put in place by the Biden administration just before he left office, the rules set up a three-tier system comprised of countries that can essentially get unfettered access to powerful AI chips, ones that will need licenses to get a limited number of chips, and those that are fully restricted from receiving chips, including China. Republican Senators, including Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), sent a letter toCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnickon Wednesday asking him to rescind the AI diffusion order before it goes into effect May 15, saying that it‚Äôs overly onerous and could hurt US competitiveness. Despite the volatility, analysts are still positive on Nvidia‚Äôs long-term prospects thanks to its enormous lead in the AI race and powerful CUDA software. What‚Äôs more,the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)insulates Nvidia servers built in Mexico from additional tariffs, which should preserve margins on those products. ‚ÄúWe still believe that overall AI demand from more mainstream customers remains strong, and AI infrastructure in general seems to be more insulated from immediate tariff effects given Mexico USMCA compliance of much of the hardware as well as (presumably) the strategic nature of the industry with substantial US buildouts coming,‚Äù Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon wrote in an investor note. Still, Nvidia will continue to play a key role in the US‚Äôs ongoing tit-for-tat trade war with China. And each new move will shake investors along the way.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. In his latest appearance on CNBC‚ÄôsSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer pushed back against widespread pessimism surrounding the U.S. economy, particularly when it comes to the health of the consumer. Referencing recent data and strong bank earnings, he argued that fears of a sharp slowdown are overstated: ‚ÄúConsumer spending is up nicely. I mean, for all the things you hear about, the pessimistic surveys, year over year is good.

I don‚Äôt think they sit there and say, you know what, there‚Äôs coming tariff, I‚Äôm going to just disappear. Now you can see these numbers are pulled through.

I‚Äôm not used to that. I‚Äôm used to really good numbers and price target bump. ‚Äú Later, citing the latest Bank of America survey showing extreme bearishness, Cramer interpreted the results as a contrarian signal that could point to an opportunity for investors: ‚ÄúWell, I just think that in the end, the fundamentals are going to will out.

The company on Thursday reported first-quarter results thatmissed estimates, and cut its profit forecast for 2025, pointing to higher-than-expected medical costs for people enrolled inMedicareplans. UnitedHealth expected claims in itsMedicare Advantagebusiness to rise at a similar rate to 2024, but CEO Andrew Witty said in Thursday's earnings call that ""indications suggest care activity increased at twice that rate,"" according to a transcript from AlphaSense. Jefferies analysts said Thursday that UnitedHealth's ""peers are in trouble"" if thebellwether's issues are applicable to insurance rivals. However, the analysts said it's also possible UnitedHealth's ""expectations were materially more aggressive than peers."" UnitedHealth shares lost over a fifth of their value on Thursday, in theirworst day in decades.

2025-04-18 22:07:00,Every Nvidia Investor Should Keep an Eye on This Number,"Nvidia(NVDA-3.01%)has been one of the hottest stocks on the market for the past couple of years, up an absurd 610% since the start of 2023 (as of April 16). Nvidia's historic run can be attributed to one thing: artificial intelligence (AI). AI has taken the world by storm, and Nvidia is one of the most important companies powering the development because itsgraphic processing units(GPUs) are the go-to fortraining AI models. That's why all Nvidia investors need to keep an eye on the company'sdata centerrevenue. It's directly tied to its AI dominance and growth potential.  NVDA Revenue (Quarterly)data byYCharts Data center revenue, which includes GPUs and other relevant hardware, is now Nvidia's largest business segment. In the fourth quarter of itsfiscal year2025, Nvidia's data center revenue grew 93% year over year to $35.6 billion (over 90% of total revenue). Nvidia investors shouldn't expect data revenue to keep growing at 90%+ quarter after quarter, but any huge drops in growth could be a red flag that demand for AI infrastructure is falling or Nvidia is losingmarket shareto competitors likeAdvanced Micro Devices. However, given Nvidia's market dominance, it would likely be the former. Much of Nvidia's valuation is built on high investor expectations of AI-driven growth and continued dominance in the data center market. Any signs of noticeable demand decline could cause investors to jump ship and the stock to become extra volatile (or more volatile than it already has been). Paying attention to Nvidia's data center revenue can help investors gauge whether the AI boom is progressing, becoming stagnant, or fading. In either case, that could affect Nvidia's value proposition to investors.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/18/every-nvidia-investor-should-keep-an-eye-on-this-n/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=4658df6f-838a-4cb2-876c-594f25f2c947&.tsrc=rss,5
2025-04-18 22:12:45,How You Can Prepare For Further Tariff-Related Economic Turmoil,"Many American consumers have struggled to catch up after the COVID-19 pandemic and the stubborn inflation that followed, and experts say tariffs could add to their financial troubles. President Donald Trump has imposed a global 10% tariff on all imports into the U.S. andadditional tariffson some of the country's closest trading partners. Economists widely believe the tariffs will increase costs for American consumers and willdrag down economic growth. Consumers seem to agree. In a recent consumer-based survey from J.D. Power, a data analytics and consumer intelligence company, almost 6 in 10 American consumers say they are somewhat stressed about their overall financial situation, and 53% said their stress has gone up in the past month. About half said they will buy fewer non-essential items and major purchases over the next year. Additionally, the majority of Americans said the U.S. is already or is very likely to experience a recession in 2025, and that tariffs will increase inflation. Investopedia talked to Jim Miller, vice president and general manager of financial services at J.D. Power, about consumers' attitudes and how they can adjust their budgets to prepare for tariffs. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. INVESTOPEDIA: What is the general attitude of consumers about the current economy? JIM MILLER:There's a high level of anxiety. I would say consumers are very concerned about prices still, and the number one concern is about the price of food and everyday items. So I guess that's all the talk about eggs and such. So, just heightened sensitivity after recent inflation, they're expecting that inflation will increase from where it's at. INVESTOPEDIA: How are they preparing for potential tariff-related economic turmoil? MILLER:We asked about what they will do during the so-called ‚Äòpause,‚Äô or while tariffs are being figured out. The number one was 41% said they're going to start cutting back on spending until there's more clarity. Now, the flip side of that is 27% said that they would stock up on everyday items before the price goes up. So it's kind of similar in cutting back on spending, but maybe a little bit of that is offset by a short-term surge in buying those things that you expect to go up in price. INVESTOPEDIA: What are your recommendations on how consumers can prepare for increased prices from tariffs? MILLER:We've been going through five-plus years of challenges between the pandemic and then inflation, so this is another shock to consumers. One of the things we see is that roughly half of consumers are living paycheck to paycheck or falling behind‚Ä¶ Generally, about 45% of consumers are financially healthy. That kind of varies a little bit, and that's similar to what we saw here. If you're not financially healthy already, this is just another challenge that you have to overcome. So I mean, a lot of it is the basics: having a budget, following a budget, making sure that you're putting money aside for an unexpected expense. Trying to create that financial buffer in your life, which I know is not easy, but that becomes really more critical as we go through these periods of turmoil. INVESTOPEDIA: How can consumers build up that financial buffer quicker? MILLER:If you do have some money already put aside, where you have it is very important. Many of the large banks, with savings accounts, are still fairly close to zero. You can find more than 3% in some cases, 4%, elsewhere, if you shop around. So, looking for that high-rate, high-yield savings account is a good move if you have money. The other thing is to use budget tools. So many banks and financial institutions offer those to their clients. We still see relatively low adoption of those tools, but we do see that when consumers start using budgeting tools, it helps their personal financial situation. They become more satisfied with their bank as well. INVESTOPEDIA: What are your recommendations on how consumers who are still in a financially healthy place can stay there amidst tariff turmoil? MILLER:One is making sure that you're staying in that category, and it seems that many of them are already putting off major purchases. Drive your car a little bit longer until things settle down. Depending on where they are within that, they may have money in the market, and it's a challenging time. The best time to have made a change would have been two or three months ago, and we've all felt the pain since that point. One thing is to just minimize the stress.Don't look at your 401(k) every dayto see if it's really in there for your retirement ‚Äî unless you're close to retirement. Keep with your ... strategy going in. The market has always rebounded. It just depends on how long it takes. So, stay the course.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/how-you-can-prepare-for-further-tariff-related-economic-turmoil-11717932,4
2025-04-18 22:27:28,"Feeling ""Cash Is King"" Right Now? Here Are the Safe Havens That Pay the Most","The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Giventhe stock market rollercoaster unleashedby President Trump's announcement two weeks ago of across-the-globe tariffs, fortifying your cash reserves seems wise. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or shifting funds from stocks into cash vehicles, it's important to consider how much you can earn from different strategies. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, indicating the change from a week ago. Right now you can earn the highest rate with a high-yield savings account, with two options paying 5.00%. But those two leaders have some special requirements that might not suit your needs, with 4.60% being the top high-yield savings rate with ""no strings attached"". Savings and money market account rates can drop at any time, however. To ensure you earn today's rates for months or even years into the future, consider a CD instead. The top rate there is also 4.60%, for terms from 6 to 10 months. Or you can lock in a slightly lower APY that will be guaranteed for longer. Rates on brokerage money market funds and cash management accounts showed little change this week, while rates on Treasurys held mostly steady in the shorter durations but declined somewhat among longer bonds. The rates below are the top nationally available APYs from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed, but can change at any time. Treasury securities pay their rate through maturity and can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect, or can be bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage. I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirect and can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account‚Äîsometimes called ahigh-yield savings account‚Äîthat lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you15 options paying 4.40% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type‚Äîmoney market or savings‚Äîpays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.40% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includesoptions paying up to 4.60% APY. Note that the ""top rates"" quoted for savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research of hundreds of banks and credit unions. These are very different from the national averages, comprising all institutions offering accounts of those types‚Äîincluding many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, national averages are always low, while the top rates we present are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.97% to 4.22% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds ""swept"" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- to 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.81% to 4.82%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsdirectly fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect‚Äîthe U.S. Treasury‚Äôs online platform for buying federal government securities‚Äîhas no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. Every six months you own the bond, your rate will change. I bond rates will go up on May 1. While we don't know the exact rate Treasury will announce that day for new bonds, we know that for existing I bond holders, your next six-month rate will increase by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe upcoming rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

For me, my portfolio is down 25% from all time highs hit in February. 80% of my stocks are in tech, 25% of my portfolio is NVDA. I have been making some tactical shifts, selling some big tech stocks holdings in favor of non-tech names, although I ended up buying UNH (United Healthcare) thinking it‚Äôs would be recession-resistant play, and of course the stock dropped 25% yesterday.",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2i1uj/how_much_is_your_portfolio_down_by/,3

2025-04-19 07:24:51,The Rise And Rise Of Reinforcement Learning: AI‚Äôs Quiet Revolution,"Reinforcement learning is a analogous to the way More the Easter Egg hunt game works with high-level hot/cold feedback about how close to the mark one is and players may after time be able to generalise this to learn about likely hiding spots for eggs like in trees, under pot-plants in bushes for example.LessPaul X. McCarthy A quiet revolution is reshaping artificial intelligence, and it‚Äôs not the flashy one grabbing headlines. While chatbots and image generators dazzle, reinforcement learning, a method refined in academia over the past two decades, is powering the next generation of AI breakthroughs. Imagine a child learning to ride a bike: no manual, just trial, error, and the joy of balance. That‚Äôs reinforcement learning, which is an algorithm that explores, adjusts, and learns from feedback, akin to an Easter egg hunt guided by ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù or ‚Äúcolder‚Äù hints. This approach isn‚Äôt just changing how machines learn; it‚Äôs redefining what intelligence means. Illustrating the Three Types of Machine Learning: More Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement LearningLessPaul X. McCarthy The Old Guard: Traditional Machine Learning To grasp Reinforcement Learning‚Äôs s ascent, let‚Äôs first look at the two pillars of traditional machine learning:   Supervised Learning: Here the algorithm is fed labeled examples such as, say, thousands of cat and dog photos and then learns to predict or generate based on that data. It‚Äôs behind everything from X-ray analysis to text generation we are all now familiar with via ChatGPT which uses lots of text data to predict the next word in a sentence from a starting prompt. But it‚Äôs expensive and requires mountains of labeled data and computational muscle. Unsupervised Learning: This involves finding patterns without guidance. It might cluster songs by melody or group public inquiry responses by theme without any bias or external perspectives. It‚Äôs more efficient and requires less data but can reveal hidden patterns in data but lacks the ability to make contextual judgments with reference to external standards of what‚Äôs ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù.  Both methods shine in their domains, and are used in combination yet they falter where data is scarce or goals are vague. That‚Äôs where Reinforcement Learning can help.  Global interest in Reinforcement Learning has More exploded since nature published two Google papers that used to show how it could be used to train an AI to play Atari games (2015) and then that defeated the worlds Go champion (2016)LessPaul X. McCarthy What is Reinforcement Learning? Reinforcement learning learns by doing, guided only by rewards or penalties from its environment. It‚Äôs less about following a script and more about figuring things out. In 2015, Nature published a paper where Google researchers demonstrated how a reinforcement learning trained ‚Äúagent‚Äù mastered Atari games using just screen pixels and the scoreboard. Through countless trials, it learned to win at Space Invaders, Q*bert, Crazy Climber and dozens of other games often with moves that stunned human players. A year later, research also published in Nature, Google used similar techniques to topple the world‚Äôs Go champion, which was a milestone once thought to be decades away. Reinforcement Learning thrives where explicit instructions don‚Äôt exist. It doesn‚Äôt need a mountain of labeled data but instead just a goal and a way to measure success.  Why Reinforcement Learning is a Game-Changer Reinforcement Learning edge lies in its efficiency and ingenuity:  Lean and Mean: Unlike computationally intensive supervised learning that are trained on sprawling high-power data centers reinforcement learning can get by with less. It learns from experience, not exhaustive examples. Outside the Box: Reinforcement learning agents explore freely, often stumbling on solutions humans miss. In Atari, the AI‚Äôs unconventional strategies hinted at its potential for fields like logistics or drug discovery. Flexible: Skills learned in one context can adapt to another. A maze-navigating robot or game-playing AI can pivot with minimal retraining.  DeepSeek‚Äôs Bombshell While OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, remains a private company, NVIDIA has become the public face of the generative AI boom. This chipmaker‚Äôs value surged from $200 billion to over $2 trillion in just two years. Many believed its advanced hardware, like that produced by NVIDIA, was essential for the massive data centers powering AI solutions from giants like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Microsoft. NVIDIA‚Äôs relationship with ChatGPT has been compared to the iconic ""Wintel"" partnership between Intel and Microsoft during the rise of Windows.    NVIDIAGPT Synergy: NVIDIA Share Price (Blue) More Surges Alongside ChatGPT Global Search Interest (Green) After Its 2022 LaunchLessPaul X. McCarthy However in January 2025, DeepSeek, unveiled a new Large Language Model trained using Reinforcement Learning . This model rivals ChatGPT‚Äôs performance while requiring significantly less computational power. The announcement impacted NVIDIA heavily, causing its stock to drop more than 10% and temporarily erasing over $500 billion in value. Investors began to see that advanced AI might not always depend on such resource-intensive hardware. DeepSeek‚Äôs research quickly gained traction. Their paper, ‚ÄúDeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,‚Äù has been cited over 500 times, making it the most referenced reinforcement learning study of 2025. The work highlights how reinforcement learning can achieve high performance without relying on excessive computing resources.Top 10 Most Cited Reinforcement Learning Papers of More 2025: Highlighting DeepSeek-R1 and Key Contributions.LessPaul X. McCarthy  A Deeper Meaning Reinforcement Learning‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt just technical but also philosophical. Its trial-and-error mimics human learning, prompting big questions. If machines can replicate this, what defines intelligence? If they spot patterns we can‚Äôt, what might we learn about our world?Andrew Ng and Toby Walsh, in conversation at UNSW More Sydney, 2024. Andrew's PhD was in Reinforcement Learning, now over two decades ago.LessPaul X. McCarthy Andrew Ng, an AI luminary and educator, touched on this in a chat with Toby Walsh at UNSW Sydney. Reflecting on his 2002 PhD thesis, Ng said, ‚ÄúMy PhD thesis was on reinforcement learning‚Ä¶ and my team worked on a robot.‚Äù His early bets are paying off today. Reinforcement Learning‚Äôs potential is vast: think more efficient energy grids, tailored education, or smarter robotics. But its autonomy demands caution and careful thought about the incentives used to train the models. An agent tasked with easing traffic might reroute cars through quiet streets, trade efficiency for disruption. Transparency and ethics will be key. Done right, though, Reinforcement Learning could usher in an era where machines don‚Äôt just mimic us but they illuminate new paths forward. Reinforcement Learning isn‚Äôt a footnote in AI‚Äôs story, it's a pivot. The hunt for smarter, leaner intelligence is on, and reinforcement learning is leading the charge.

2025-04-19 09:12:00,Can Nvidia's Jensen Huang Beat This Latest Challenge? Here's What History Says.,"Nvidia(NVDA-3.01%)stock may have been at the top of the world a few months ago -- but these days, it's been wallowing in the doldrums. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant isn't alone. Fellow tech and growthstocks have tumbledin recent weeks amid concern about President Trump's tariffs on imports. The idea is these taxes may increase costs for companies such as Nvidia that produce products abroad -- and a general increase in prices may hurt the overall economy. All this has pressured tech companies, even pushing theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC-0.13%)into a bear market earlier this month. Though Trump's exemption of electronics products from tariffs was a bit of bright news, the president also signaled this move may be temporary. On top of this, Nvidia faces another headwind, and that's restrictions on chip exports to China. And just this week, this problem deepened. Can Nvidia chief Jensen Huang beat this latest challenge? Let's turn to history for an answer. Image source: Getty Images. First, a quick bit of background on Nvidia. The company has built an artificial intelligence (AI) empire, offering a broad range of products and services to customers developing AI platforms. And the crown jewel of this is Nvidia's AI chips, known asgraphics processing units(GPUs). They drive key AI tasks such as training and inferencing -- and importantly, they are the world's most powerful and sought-after accelerators. All this has helped Nvidia generate double- and triple-digit revenue growth over the past couple of years, reaching record levels into the billions of dollars. And Nvidia focuses on innovation in order to keep this leadership and revenue growth going. But in recent times, the picture has darkened. As mentioned, Nvidia, along with other tech players, faces uncertainty due to the developing tariff situation. Yes, an exemption is in place now, but the Trump administration indicated it may soon announce a new tariff level for electronics. Until we know the level of that potential tariff, risk remains. In addition, a new challenge has emerged. Nvidia says the U.S. government informed the company that it must have a license to export its H20 chips to China. This is a new and unexpected development, and as a result, Nvidia announced a $5.5 billion charge related to H20 inventory and purchase commitments. This charge will be included in the fiscal first quarter, set to end on April 27. The government hasn't granted Nvidia or fellow chip designers a license, so for the moment, they can't export to China. And unless the government offers companies licenses, and quickly, it's likely this will impact earnings in coming quarters too. So, it's logical to expect lower revenue from Nvidia and its peers, at least in the near term. Now, let's consider whether Nvidia's Huang can overcome this latest challenge. Here, we can look to his moves in the past when challenges have come up. For example, when the pandemic disrupted the global supply chain a few years ago, Huang paid more than $1 billion to secure its chip supply. Nvidia doesn't manufacture its chips, and instead relies onTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Another example: When the Biden administration announced the initial chip restrictions to China, Huang set Nvidia to work designing a new chip to match export guidelines -- that became the H20. These issues, spanning 2021 and 2022, supported earnings growth and eventually led to share price performance.  NVDAdata byYCharts And Huang hasn't been afraid of seizing opportunities too, for instance turning the GPU, which originally served the gaming market, into a key element for general-purpose computing. Nvidia launched parallel computing platform CUDA to make this happen back in 2006. This broadening of Nvidia's reach also led to a time of share price gains.  NVDAdata byYCharts So, history shows us Huang always has been proactive, which has resulted in positive outcomes for Nvidia. Now, let's return to our question: Will Huang beat this latest challenge? History shows us the Nvidia CEO has a strong track record of making the right decisions at the right times. That's positive. And right now, Huang is continuing this -- he arrived in Beijing this week to meet with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, according to Reuters. Of course, no matter how active Huang is in this situation, the U.S. government ultimately is the decision maker. And if sales to China are completely eliminated, this will weigh on Nvidia's earnings -- sales to that country made up 14% of the company's data center revenue in the 2024 fiscal year. Still, Nvidia has shown its resilience facing past challenges, and the company remains the leader in the high-growth AI market. So, even in the worst-case scenario, there's reason to believe the resourceful Huang will find a way to limit the impact -- and all this makes Nvidia a stronglong-term buyfor tech investors, even amid the current turmoil.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/19/can-nvidias-jensen-huang-beat-latest-challenge/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=abd53614-c187-41ae-8bac-1a47279eeca1&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-19 10:05:00,Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Intel 5 Years From Now,"Intel(INTC-1.61%)has been one of the more disappointing stocks in modern market history. Shares of the veteran chipmaker, which helped pioneer the digital age, are down almost 15% over the last 20 years, as the company missed out on major technology transitions such as mobile and now artificial intelligence (AI), including passing up an opportunity to invest in OpenAI even as recently as in 2017. Meanwhile, competitors likeAMDandNvidiahave soared past Intel, as chip stocks have generally outperformed over the last decade, even as Intel has been a laggard. Intel gave investors a dash of hope earlier this year, hiring Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO. Tan is the formerCadence Design SystemsCEO, who had resigned from Intel's board last August after growing frustration with the company's lack of risk-taking and AI strategy. However, the company still faces structural headwinds and a legacy of poor strategic decisions that will be difficult to unwind. Looking ahead five years, investors are hopeful that Tan can drive a comeback at the chip giant, but I think these two tech stocks will leapfrog Intel over the next two years. Image source: Getty Images. AppLovin(APP3.50%)was one of the brightest growth stories of 2024, as shares of the mobile game developer and adtech company jumped up more than 700% last year. Following worries about softening consumer sentiment and President Trump's trade war, AppLovin's market cap has retreated to $81 billion, lower than Intel's $88.6 billion, as of the end of this week. AppLovin is a good bet to be more valuable than Intel in the next five years because it's growing so rapidly. In 2024, the company's advertising revenue jumped 75% to $3.22 billion, and it recently sold its mobile apps business so it can focus on the core adtech business. The company's growth is attributable to the Axon AI engine it built from scratch using its own mobile app games to test and develop --an advantage mostadtech companiesdon't have. Now, the company is expanding into areas like connected TV (CTV), e-commerce, and other industry verticals, showing it's only just begun to tap the mobile ad market, as it has traditionally focused on mobile game developers. With the stock down roughly 50% from its peak now, AppLovin also looks much more affordable at a price-to-earnings ratio of 52. Micron(MU-0.77%)has a number of things in common with Intel, as it's one of the few other integrated device makers in the U.S., meaning it both designs and manufacturing chips. Like Intel, Micron also has a lot of exposure to the business cycle, so prices for the memory chips that it makes can change rapidly, according to supply/demand dynamics. However, Micron's recent results show the company continues to benefit from the AI boom, as its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are in high demand for data centers. In the fiscal second quarter that ended in February, revenue jumped 38% to $8.05 billion, paced by a surge in data center revenue, as the data center biz now make up more than half of its revenue. Its margins have also significantly improved thanks to stronger demand and a better pricing environment. Gross margin doubled to 36.8%, and adjusted earnings per share jumped from $0.42 to $1.56. Over the coming years, Micron should benefit from its leading position as an integrated memory chip company and increasing demand from AI, as its biggest customer is Nvidia. The stock also has an advantage over Intel in valuation. Micron trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17 right now. If its data center segment continues to boom, the stock should surge higher. Currently, Micron has a market cap of $79.4 billion, meaning it won't take much for it to overtake Intel in valuation. The company just has to keep doing what it's doing. If chip demand remains strong and the AI boom continues, Micron looks an easy winner.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/19/prediction-2-stocks-that-will-be-worth-more-than-i/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=ee955745-62bc-4ac9-8429-8d7d48927939&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-19 10:30:00,Can Nvidia Stock Hit $200 in the Next Year?,"Nvidia(NVDA-3.01%)stock has turned in a disappointing performance so far in 2025, dropping 26% since hitting a 52-week high in the first week of the year, and the broader market sentiment suggests that it may not be out of the woods yet. The semiconductor giant is contending with multiple challenges ranging from a potential slowdown inartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure spending to the rising competition in the AI chip market to a potential increase in manufacturing costs thanks to the ongoing tariff war. Nvidia received another blow last week after investment bankCitilowered its price target on the stock to $150 from $163, citing a slight slowdown in data center spending in the U.S. However, it is worth noting that Nvidia's 12-month median price target, as per 67 analysts covering the stock, stands at $175, which points toward a 58% jump from current levels. But can Nvidia do better than analysts' expectations and hit $200 despite a challenging economic scenario? Let's find out. One reason why Citi cut its price target on Nvidia is a potential slowdown in data center construction. The investment bank is anticipating 35% growth in data center spending this year by the top four cloud infrastructure providers --Amazon,Meta Platforms,Alphabet, andMicrosoft(MSFT-1.13%)-- as compared to the earlier estimate of 40%. It sees a further slowdown in 2026, with spending expected to increase by 15%. The lower estimate can be attributed to a projected slowdown in economic growth due to the tariff-related uncertainty. Microsoft, for instance, has already said that it is ""slowing or pausing"" the construction of some data centers in Ohio that are in the early stages. The tech giant is reportedly scaling back some of its data center construction internationally as well. However, Microsoft's move to slow down data center expansion can be attributed to the change in its arrangement with OpenAI. Earlier, Microsoft was the sole provider of data center capacity toOpenAI. However, OpenAI can now build its own data center infrastructure. The company is a part of the Stargate project, under which it is reportedly going to build AI data centers with an investment of $100 billion. The first Stargate data center is expected to be completed by the middle of next year in Texas, and it will reportedly be equipped with 400,000 AI GPU (graphics processing unit) systems from Nvidia, according to a Bloomberg report. OpenAI and its partners are expected to construct around 10 AI data centers as a part of the Stargate project. If that's indeed the case, the demand for Nvidia's chips should continue to remain solid and drive remarkable growth for the company. That's because each Nvidia Blackwell B100 GPU is reportedly priced between $30,000 to $35,000. Meanwhile, a combination of Nvidia's Blackwell GPU and the Grace CPU (central processing unit) could be priced between $60,000 and $70,000. What's more, the flagship server system composed of multiple Nvidia GPUs and CPUs can command a price of $3 million, while mid-range systems can cost $1.8 million. So, the massive investments under Stargate, which could go up to $500 billion over the next four years, could ensure that Nvidia's data center business continues to grow at a healthy pace. Another thing worth noting is that cloud computing giants are unlikely to cut spending on AI infrastructure. Alphabet, for instance, has reiterated that it will stick to its $75 billion capital spending forecast for this year. Amazon has also laid out a $100 billion capital spending plan for the current fiscal year, a huge majority of which is expected to be on AI data centers. Even OpenAI recently raised $40 billion in funding to shore up its AI infrastructure. The fact that the Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and chips, among other electronic equipment, from the reciprocal tariffs imposed on China should help cloud computing companies stick to their capital expenditure plans and give Nvidia a boost. In all, the stage seems set for Nvidia to sell more of its data center GPUs going forward. But will that be enough to help the stock regain its mojo? Nvidia is expected to maintain a solid pace of earnings growth in the current fiscal year (which will end in January next year). Analysts are forecasting a 51% jump in its bottom line in fiscal 2026 to $4.53 per share. Nvidia is currently trading at 25 times forward earnings, which is lower than its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 40. However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia's earnings growth outpace the market's expectations in the coming year, as it isforecasting an improvementin its margins later in the fiscal year. However, even if we assume that Nvidia manages to deliver $4.53 per share in earnings in the current fiscal year, which would be a nice improvement over last year, and the market rewards its strong earnings growth with a higher multiple of 40 (in line with its five-year average forward earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $181. While that's below the $200 mark, it would still represent a 63% upside from current levels. However, if Nvidia manages to clock stronger earnings growth as its margins pick up, it could very well hit the $200 mark. That's why investors looking to buy a toptech stockthat's trading at an attractive valuation and is capable of delivering healthy gains should consider buying Nvidia before it steps on the gas once again.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/19/can-nvidia-stock-hit-200-in-the-next-year/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=5b131001-23ab-4183-b5c7-0f404341238a&.tsrc=rss,4

2025-04-19 12:00:00,Earnings Season Kicks Into Gear While Tariffs Dominate Markets,"Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and ... More Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. Despite being mired in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 as a group are expected to grow earning at double the pace of the overall market. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Getty Images Within the S&P 500, 32 companies reported earnings last week, heavily emphasizing bank earnings. 71% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the first-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 121 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, marking the second busiest week of the reporting season.  S&P 500 Earnings SeasonGlenview Trust, FactSet, Bloomberg Earnings At A Glance The financial sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement, while downward revisions to the technology sector offset the improvement. According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%.   Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500‚Äôs blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 7.2% year-over-year, equal to the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have faded as concerns about earnings and sales have increased due to the increased tariffs. S&P 500 Earnings SummaryGlenview Trust, FactSet MORE FOR YOUGoogle Confirms Gmail Warning‚Äî3 Billion Users Must Now ActWWE WrestleMania Results, Winners And Grades On Night 1Microsoft‚Äôs Free Upgrade Offer‚ÄîBad News For 240 Million Windows Users  Market Performance Tariff worries weighed on stocks with a 1.5% decline last week. After this week‚Äôs pullback, the S&P 500 sits 14% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed last week. The group remains in bear market territory at 26.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market ReturnsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  10-Year US Treasury Yield Much was made of the yield on the 10-year US Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness in the previous week. The typical doomsayers came out in force to predict some new apocalypse, but several less frightening factors seemed to be at play.   Last week, the 10-year Treasury yield was back to behaving more typically, with yields falling during the stock market weakness. Most of the decline in yields was from a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors, which reversed some of the increase from the previous week. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning US Treasuries. Usually, this happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks during these periods.10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield DecompositionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg King Dollar Recently, there has also been some gnashing of teeth about the US dollar‚Äôs depreciation against other currencies. This caused the alarmists to spread worries about the US dollar falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. Indeed, the tariffs or falling US yields could result in some rebalancing within currency reserves, but any dethroning of the king dollar remains a minuscule probability. The fact is that there is currently no suitable replacement for the US dollar. This does not mean the US should abuse its status, but overwrought concerns are not yet warranted. A longer-term history of the dollar shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999!US Dollar Woes?Glenview Trust, Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500‚Äôs market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7‚Äôs earnings are expected to grow 14.8% year-over-year versus 7.2% for the rest of the S&P 500. The blended earnings growth rate of the S&P 500 excluding the Magnificent 7 is 5.1%. Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday.Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings GrowthGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Beyond the Magnificent 7, the second busiest week of reporting season has a plethora of notable companies scheduled, including 3M (MMM), Boeing (BA), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Procter & Gamble (PG), and PepsiCo (PEP). Earnings Insights By Sector According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. The healthcare sector is benefiting from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which are both expected to swing from losses in the same quarter last year to profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. If these two companies are excluded, the earnings growth rate for healthcare would be 3.6% according to FactSet. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices.Earnings By SectorGlenview Trust, FactSet Revenue Results By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.3% has slightly undershot expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, once the distortions from the healthcare sector‚Äôs accounting are removed, the technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth.Sales Growth By SectorGlenview Trust, FactSet What To Watch Next Week With relatively few top-tier economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. Markets remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs should be positively correlated with the extent of economic growth headwind. Actual economic data has remained relatively resilient despite the tariff storm. On the other hand, soft data from surveys shows the reasons for the consternation about the economic outlook. For example, consumer sentiment readings have plunged. While this plunge does not guarantee an impending recession, it points to at least some economic softness if the 2022 period is a proper corollary.Consumer SentimentGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Consumer sentiment remains very dependent on the political party of those surveyed. Just as the opposite was the case under President Biden in 2022, Democratic sentiment has plunged relative to Republicans under President Trump.Consumer Sentiment By Political PartyGlenview Trust, Bloomberg This week‚Äôs earnings reports should provide insight into additional sectors and two of the Magnificent 7. With the tariff overhang and growing concerns about the resilience of the artificial intelligence wave, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched even more closely. Consensus earnings growth estimates for the calendar year 2025 earnings have been reduced, even though the first quarter's earnings have arrived as expected thus far. Generally, at 14% off their highs, stocks expect these tariffs to be temporary and a passing headwind for earnings. This expectation could be valid, but there could be more downside if elevated tariffs are viewed as more permanent and likely to send the global economy into recession. Upside could come from significant trade deals that lessen the headwinds or a pivot from the administration away from tariffs. The short-term forecast for stocks seems even more impossible to predict than ever, but the long-term outlook is almost certainly not at risk. Stocks have outperformed cash, bonds, and inflation by a wide margin over the long term despite many setbacks, many much scarier than tariffs or recession.

2025-04-19 12:00:00,What Analysts Think of Google Parent Alphabet's Stock Ahead of Earnings,"Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is slated to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday, with analysts largely bullish on the tech giant's ability to weathereconomic uncertainty. Citi analysts said recently they expect Google Search would be ‚Äúamong the last platforms to experience macro impacts and among the first to recover.‚ÄùCiti also highlighted its potential for growth from the adoption of artificial intelligence tools like Google‚Äôs AI Mode in Search, as well as the latest iteration of the company‚Äôs Gemini large language model. Morgan Stanley also cited ‚ÄúAI-driven platform-level innovation‚Äù on Search and YouTube as a reason for ‚Äúconfidence in the durability of long term growth.‚ÄùCiti and Morgan Stanley gave Alphabet price targets of $195 and $185, respectively. Of the 19 analysts covering Alphabet tracked by Visible Alpha, 14 have ‚Äúbuy‚Äù or equivalent ratings for the stock, with the rest issuing ‚Äúhold‚Äù ratings. Their consensus price target near $195 would suggest roughly 29% upside from Thursday's closing price at about $151. During the company's earnings call, Alphabet could face questions from analysts about aU.S. District Court rulingthat Google has illegally maintained monopolies in the online advertising industry. Citi analysts said they ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Google ultimately spin off its ad network,‚Äù as a result of the ruling, but that Google‚Äôs core businesses would likely not be as impacted. Alphabet is expected to report fiscal first-quarter revenue of $89.22 billion, up 11% year-over-year, and net income of $24.71 billion, or $2.01 per share, up from $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a year ago.

2025-04-19 12:30:00,4 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Amidst the market volatility due to tariffs and trade tensions, many top tech companies are now selling at much more attractive valuations than just a few months ago. Let's look at four leading tech stocks you can buy right now for the long haul. All four were recently trading atforward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es)of under 22, and yet each still has a bright future ahead that merits a higher valuation. Pinterest(PINS-1.10%)operates an online vision board that has more than 550 million monthly active users (MAU) across the globe. The company has always trailed other social media sites when it comes to monetizing its user base. But since taking over a little less than three years ago, CEO William Ready has emphasized technological investments and making the platform more shoppable. Better monetizing its user base is a huge opportunity for Pinterest, especially in the markets outside the U.S. and Europe where more than half its user base resides. The company has teamed up with Google to help better target and monetize these users. Thus far, it has seen early success, with its ""rest of world"" revenue up 44% last quarter. Meanwhile, the company is also looking for its Performance+ platform, launched last fall, to be a growth driver. The platform integrates its automation andartificial intelligence (AI)features to simplify campaign setups, improve the creative process, better target users, and optimize bidding. The platform is meant to improve ad effectiveness and conversions, which should lead to high ad impressions and rates while attracting new advertisers. Pinterest's stock is cheap, and it has a nice long-term opportunity ahead. Alphabet(GOOGL-1.44%)(GOOG-1.44%)is best known for its Google search business, and search plays a major role in its expansive advertising empire. Google also owns YouTube, the fourth-largest digital advertising platform globally. It serves ads to third-party apps and websites through its Ad Manager platform and helps companies like Pinterest better monetize their user base in emerging markets. In a world changing with AI, Google's extensive ad network and adtech tools should not be underestimated. In addition, the company has other exciting non-advertising businesses. Its fastest-growing business is Google Cloud, where it handles customers' AI workloads and helps them develop their own AI models and apps. It's even developed its own custom AI chips to help performance and lower costs. In addition, it has the leading robotaxi business in the U.S. withWaymo, and is at the forefront of quantum computing with itsWillow chip. Alphabet has a collection of strong businesses, and the stock is just too cheap at its current valuation. Image source: Getty Images No company has been a bigger beneficiary of AI thanNvidia(NVDA-3.01%), which has seen its revenue surge more than 380% over the past two years. This growth has been powered by data center operators using itsgraphic processing units (GPUs)to power AI workloads.Cloud computingcompanies, such as Alphabet, are spending heavily to build out data center capacity to meet rising demand due to AI. Meanwhile, companies likeMeta Platforms, OpenAI, and xAI are also investing heavily in infrastructure to build better AI models. One of the best ways to advance AI models is through increased computing power, which leads to the need for more GPUs. Nvidia's CUDA software platform is also able to enhance the efficiency and scalability of training AI models, which has helped create a wide moat for the company in the GPU space; that's a major reason that its GPU market share tops 80%. With AI still in its early innings, Nvidia still has years of solid growth in front of it. As such, the stock looks attractively priced at current levels. The leader in customer relationship management (CRM),Salesforce(CRM-1.15%)is turning towardagentic AIto be its next big growth driver. One of the main selling points for its CRM platform has been that it gives its customers a unified view of all their siloed data, so they can get better real-time insights and improve forecasting. With AI agents seamlessly integrated into the Salesforce ecosystem, customers can now use AI agents to help with customer service, marketing, and sales. Salesforce offers pre-built agents designed for specific sectors like retail, healthcare, and financial services. However, users can also design their own AI agents through the no-code and low-code tools available within the platform. Salesforce has also created an AI agent marketplace with over 200 partners to add new actions and templates for its AI agents, expanding its use cases. Agentforce is a product with consumption-based pricing. It costs $2 per conversation. If its agents can demonstrate improved efficiency and cost savings, this could become a big growth driver for the company. The solution has already seen good initial demand, with 3,000 paid customers using the platform since its launch. With this big opportunity in front of it and a cheap stock price, Salesforce looks like a solid long-term option for investors.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/19/4-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=07667964-d737-45e0-9e2e-1da52a561c0d&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-19 13:15:00,Prediction: These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giants Will Outperform Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years,"Nvidia(NVDA-3.01%)has been the star of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom over the last two-and-a-half years. Its GPUs are the cornerstone of every big data center project from the hyperscale cloud customers investing tens of billions of dollars in AI. That's led to massive revenue growth and even stronger earnings growth over the last two years for Nvidia. Investors have been duly rewarded. Nvidia's stock price climbed 239% in 2023 and another 171% in 2024. That strong price appreciation led the company to briefly top the list of most valuable companies. But now, after the recent stock market sell-off, Nvidia shares currently sit around 25% off their all-time high reached in January. While many investors may be looking at the AI leader and considering buying shares at the lower price, two otherartificial intelligence companieslook poised to outperform the semiconductor stock over the long run, helped by competitive advantages that give them great staying power, no matter how the AI story plays out. Image source: Getty Images. Meta Platforms(META-0.22%)may be the biggest long-term beneficiary of advances in generative AI of any company in the world, and it's spending heavily to make that a reality. Management said itscapital expenditures will climb as high as $65 billionthis year as it looks to capitalize on the potential of generative AI with a new data center build-out. While that budget isn't as big as the three big cloud computing platforms, Meta doesn't rent its servers to anyone -- it's all for its own business use. The company wouldn't be spending so much if it didn't see a massive opportunity for its business. It's already seeing positive returns from its advances in AI so far. Meta applied its learnings from developinglarge language modelsto its recommendation app, expanding it to more general recommendations across content formats. The result was higher engagement and more time spent on its apps. Meanwhile, it's seeing strong adoption of its earliest ad creative AI, Advantage+ Creative, with 4 million advertisers using it. Expanding generative AI could open the door for more small businesses to buy ads on Meta's apps with little experience or overhead. Meta could eventually offer an AI agent thattakes all the hard work out of developing an ad campaign. ""Over the long term, advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we're going to go do the rest for them,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call last year. That unlocks a slew of new advertiser for Meta, on top of continuously improving ad efficacy, which translates into higher average ad prices. Meta is also working on AI chatbots for WhatsApp and Messenger, which could handle customer service and higher-touch sales at scale for businesses. The potential of each business havinga fleet of AI agents on WhatsApp could be worth $100 billion, according to at least one analyst. The value it unlocks for businesses is massive and could drive another leg up in revenue for Meta. The company benefits from very high operating leverage as a software company. Innovations in AI can unlock value for literally billions of people, a scale no other company is working with. So as its AI services gain traction and generate more revenue, it should see strong profit growth. A lot of the potential value of AI to Meta stock isn't fully reflected in its stock price. Shares trade for about 21.2 times forward earnings, as of this writing. But with growing engagement and an expanding suite of market-leading ad products, Meta should see substantial earnings growth as it builds out its AI capabilities. Nvidia wouldn't be where it is today without the manufacturing capabilities ofTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.13%), commonly known as TSMC. The chip manufacturer dominates the industry, accounting for over two-thirds of all spending on semiconductor fabrication. And that share is growing. There's good reason companies are spending more with TSMC while other fabs tread water: TSMC is the only company capable ofmanufacturing the world's most advanced chips at scale, and there's very high demand for advanced chips right now. What's more, its technology lead and scale allow it to manufacture chips at lower costs per chip compared to competition. That creates a virtuous cycle, whereby TSMC wins more big contracts from leading chip designers, which allows it to reinvest in advancing its technology and scaling its manufacturing capabilities. As a result, the gap between TSMC and the competition is growing wider and wider. That means TSMC has exceptional staying power. While tariffs pose a short-term threat to demand for semiconductors as prices will have to increase for end users, in the long run, demand will continue to climb. TSMC is positioned to win an outsized portion of that demand, especially as cloud customers require the most advanced chips to make efficient use of space and energy in data centers. There's no guarantee Nvidia will remain in the position it currently finds itself: supplying the vast majority of AI accelerators to hyperscale customers. In fact, all Nvidia's biggest customers aredeveloping their own custom silicon solutionswhile looking for alternative's to Nvidia's high-priced chips. But no matter who's designing the chips used in AI data centers, TSMC will be the one printing and packaging them. There's practically no other option. That means TSMC shouldn't see any margin erosion over time, and management should easily be able to maintain its target gross margin target of 53% or higher. Meanwhile, the stock trades for just 17.4 times forward earnings, which is near its lowest valuation since the start of the AI boom.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/19/prediction-these-2-artificial-intelligence-giants/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=dd18a41c-eedf-4ab5-9688-a9b189f15ea4&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-19 13:41:00,Prediction AMD Will Soar Over the Next 5 Years. Here's 1 Reason Why.,"In the current environment, it seems antithetical to say anything positive aboutAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.88%). Thesemiconductor stockhas lost more than 60% of its value over the last 13 months as industry struggles and tariff-related worries have weighed on the company. However, the investment case for AMD stock looks completely different, and given its advancements in one part of the chip industry, the stock could be in the perfect position to prosper over the next five years. Despite tariff-related worries andNvidia's market lead, it could be AMD's time to succeed withartificial intelligence(AI). Indeed, AMD and its peers face uncertainty as the U.S. government works to cut off China's GPU supply. The company revealed in an SEC filing that it might face charges of up to $800 million related to that policy change. Nonetheless, investors should remember that the data center segment, which includes AI accelerators, generated $12.6 billion in revenue. That was a 94% yearly increase, and it is nearly 16 times the estimated charges over the tariff hit. Moreover, tech giants such asMeta PlatformsandMicrosoftchose AMD's MI300 accelerator over Nvidia's chips, indicating it has developed a competitive niche. It also plans to release the MI350 this year and the MI400 in 2026 to advance its capabilities, which should close some of the competitive gap and position it to further capitalize on AI. Additionally, all of these developments come at a time when AMD'sforward P/E ratiois just 19. Analysts also believe AMD's overall revenue growth rate will rise from 14% last year to 23% in 2025. A strong performance from the data center segment and signs the down cycle may be ending in its gaming and embedded segments should put AMD in a more favorable light. Ultimately, the selling in AMD stock appears overdone. The stock isn't cheap today, but its best days still lie ahead. With AMD competing more aggressively in the AI accelerator market, the stock appears to have what it takes to rise to all-time highs and beyond in the next few years.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/19/prediction-amd-will-soar-over-the-next-5-years/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=d5b81544-61b3-4aa5-b093-0aca79bb745d&.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-19 13:45:00,Prediction: 1 Stock That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now,"Nvidia(NVDA-3.01%)has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past five years, delivering remarkable gains of 1,300% to investors during this period and significantly outpacing the tech-ladenNasdaq Composite's returns of about 100%. The semiconductor giant's terrific upside can be attributed to the healthy demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are powering multiple applications ranging fromartificial intelligence (AI)servers to cars to personal computers to ""digital twins."" These multiple end markets have led to outstanding growth in Nvidia's revenue and earnings over the past five years.  NVDAdata byYCharts Nvidia's market capitalization of $2.5 trillion makes it the third-largest company globally. The good part is that Nvidia could deliver more gains in the future thanks to a sizable addressable market that could allow it to sustain healthy revenue and earnings growth for years to come. However, there is another tech giant that could outpace Nvidia in the long run, thanks to its presence in several multibillion-dollar end markets. Let's take a closer at that name and check why it has the potential to overtake Nvidia's market cap in the next five years. Amazon.com(AMZN-1.01%)is the world'sfourth-largest company, ranking behindNvidiawith amarket capof $1.9 trillion. That gap puts Nvidia's market cap 30% larger than Amazon's. Amazon has underperformed both Nvidia and the Nasdaq Composite over the past five years, registering gains of just 45% during this period. Another thing worth noting is that Amazon stock has lost about 20% of its value so far in 2025 amid broader weakness in the stock market due to tariff-fueled unease.  NVDAdata byYCharts However, the recent pullback means that investors now have an opportunity to buy a solid tech company that can benefit from multiple lucrative markets at an attractive valuation. Amazon is one of the leading e-commerce companies in the world, and it also dominates the massive cloud computing market that's set to get bigger thanks to AI. Amazon reportedly controlled 40% of the U.S. e-commerce market last year. That's a great position to be in as the U.S. e-commerce market is expected to show a healthy annual growth rate of 15% through the end of the decade, generating annual revenue of over $19 trillion. Importantly, Amazon is expanding its wings in foreign e-commerce markets as well. For example, Germany is considered to be the largest e-commerce market in Europe, and Amazon has reportedly captured half of this market already. Meanwhile, Amazon is the biggest e-commerce player in the U.K. as well, which is the second-largest e-commerce market in Europe and the third-largest globally. The size of the European e-commerce market is expected to triple between 2024 and 2030, generating over $10 trillion in annual revenue after five years. So, Amazon's e-commerce segment should witness robust growth going forward, and a similar situation should unfold in the cloud computing space as well. Amazon's 30% share of the cloud infrastructure market puts it well ahead of second-placedMicrosoft, which has a 21% share. The cloud infrastructure market is projected to generate annual revenue of $2 trillion in 2030, according toGoldman Sachs. AI is set to play an important role in driving this market's growth over the next five years, and the investment bank points out thatgenerative AIcould account for 10% to 15% of global cloud spending by 2030. This massive end-market opportunity could supercharge Amazon's growth. The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business finished 2024 with almost $108 billion in revenue, up by 19% from the year-ago period. The potential size of the global cloud infrastructure market and Amazon's solid share in this space suggest that this segment could take off remarkably in the long run. More importantly, the company has been trying to bring down the cost of running AI applications on AWS by developing in-house custom processors, which it claims can offer a 30% to 40% price-to-performance advantage as compared to cloud instances powered by graphics cards. As a result, many companies have started using Amazon's cloud instances powered by its custom AI processors to run AI workloads. Amazon is set to spend heavily on capital expenditures (capex) this year to shore up its AI infrastructure. Specifically, the company plans to bump up its capex by 20% in 2025 to $100 billion. This heavy spending is going to weigh on Amazon's earnings growth this year, with analysts expecting its bottom line to jump by 14% in 2025 to $6.32 per share. However, the forecast for the next couple of years points toward an acceleration in Amazon's earnings growth.  AMZN EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts Its earnings could jump by 19% next year, followed by a stronger jump of 25% in 2027. Assuming Amazon can sustain even a 20% annual earnings growth rate in the three years following 2027, its earnings could jump to $16.22 per share in 2030. If the stock is trading at 28 times earnings at that time, in line with the current level of the tech-ladenNasdaq-100index, its stock price could jump to $454. That would be 1.6 times Amazon's stock price as of the April 16 market close, which could send Amazon's market cap closer to $4.75 trillion. This solid jump could be enough for Amazon to overtake Nvidia's market cap over the next five years if the latter struggles on account of a drop in AI hardware spending or because of increased competition. Given that Amazon is currently trading at 28 times forward earnings, investors are getting a good deal on this""Magnificent Seven""stock that I predict will overtake Nvidia's market cap in the next five years.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/19/prediction-1-stock-that-will-be-worth-more-than-nv/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=dab037fa-c572-4cb7-b788-088709eba6c3&.tsrc=rss,4

President Trump's¬†[wide-ranging tariffs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-trump-touts-trade-talk-progress-as-nvidia-ceo-visits-china-191201940.html)¬†have sent the¬†[stock market tumbling](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-resume-sell-off-as-tariff-costs-hit-tech-and-powell-delivers-starkest-warning-yet-on-trumps-trade-war-202622781.html)¬†and¬†[recession fears soaring](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-becomes-the-first-wall-street-bank-to-forecast-a-us-recession-following-trumps-tariffs-222019272.html).

As the dust settles and markets wait for more information on the result of the¬†[administration's 90-day tariff pause](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-he-decided-on-90-day-tariff-pause-because-people-were-yippy-and-afraid-181126787.html), the pressing question for investors is how much of an economic slowdown the recent stock market sell-off has priced in.

Market history suggests that if the economy is indeed headed for recession, stocks might have further to fall.

""I'm not sure the stock market has quite processed the probability of a recession,"" Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox told Yahoo Finance.

""Usually when you get a recession, you get a bear market, or you get you get the \[S&P 500\] falling a lot more than it has.""

As our chart of the week shows, the S&P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) has seen a larger drawdown than the 18.9% peak-to-trough drop in the index this year during each recession since 1973.

In other words, should a recession result from Trump's tariff plans and the index not make new lows, this year's drop would be the mildest stock market reaction to an economic downturn in at least 50 years.

""The market correction is well advanced, but probably not complete IF we end up in a recession or the fear of one gets more fully priced,"" Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a note to clients on April 13.

As economists have dissected the impact of Trump's tariffs, many have[¬†argued recession odds are rising¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)as the new hefty duties are expected to boost inflation and weigh on economic growth.

Goldman Sachs economists most recently placed the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 45%, well above the historical average of 15% over any 12-month period. JPMorgan has already¬†[issued a forecast for a recession later this year](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-becomes-the-first-wall-street-bank-to-forecast-a-us-recession-following-trumps-tariffs-222019272.html). Same with Renaissance Macro's head of economics Neil Dutta.

Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi believes a recession is more likely than not, placing 60% odds on the economy rolling over in the next 12 months. Zandi[¬†told Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/recession-more-likely-not-trade-140951594.html)¬†that if the Trump administration takes an ""off ramp"" and lowers some threatened tariffs, the economy could skirt recession.

""That doesn't feel like what's going to happen, at least not right now,"" Zandi said.

Wall Street strategists have responded to rising recession fears in kind, with many lowering their price targets for the S&P 500 this year.

Citi, for instance, recently lowered its year-end S&P 500 price target to 5,800 from a prior target of 6,500. At least nine other Wall Street banks tracked by Yahoo Finance¬†[have cut their S&P 500 forecasts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-stock-bulls-throw-in-the-towel-as-tariff-market-meltdown-projects-negative-outcomes-to-infinity-111344611.html)¬†amid the fallout from Trump's tariffs. Teams at Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Evercore ISI, RBC Capital Markets, and JPMorgan each see the S&P 500 now ending 2025 at 5,700 or lower.

The index closed on Thursday at 5,282.

This makes Citi's forecast relatively optimistic, reflecting 9% upside from current levels and a world in which trade negotiations are successful over the next 90 days and the effective US tariff moves lower.

If negotiations don't materialize and tariffs weigh more heavily on the economy Citi's bear case sees the S&P 500 end the year at 4,700.

""That is more of an aggressive slowdown,"" Citi equity strategist Drew Pettit told Yahoo Finance. ""That's actual recession. That's an actual hit to long-term earnings growth for companies ...

2025-04-19 15:25:48,The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over,"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first

Nearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade ‚Äì a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions ‚Äì is over, according to the Bank of America‚Äôs latest survey.
Over the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump‚Äôs tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.

While it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn‚Äôt the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.
Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall ‚Äì a scenario today‚Äôs US market is particularly vulnerable to.
One of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.

Since 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc ‚Äì over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.

Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: ‚ÄúTechnology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.‚Äù
However, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.

The upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500‚Äôs earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.

All of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.
In fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.
Markets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.
Mr Gimber explains: ‚ÄúOne of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.
‚ÄúThis has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.‚Äù",Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2ys45/the_era_of_american_stock_market_exceptionalism/,4
2025-04-19 16:38:52,Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Metaverse Stock to Invest in?,"We recently published a list of12 Best Metaverse Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best metaverse stocks to invest in. The metaverse, which comes under the video games industry, is a fast-growing digital frontier where immersive tech creates interactive virtual worlds. It is built on virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and mixed reality, offering simulated spaces for socializing, working, learning, and playing. Essentially, it blends digital and physical realities to provide customized and immersive experiences via avatars, live communication, and spatial computing. Users no longer just browse static web pages ‚Äì they move through dynamic 3D environments that mirror and enhance real-world interactions, marking a shift from simple apps to fully immersive virtual spaces. Metaverse is segmented into four types: lifelogging, augmented reality, mirror world, and virtual reality. The metaverse grows mainly by combining content streaming and blockchain infrastructure, where blockchain has improved secure transactions, digital asset ownership, and governance. These systems support user-driven economies where people build, sell, and profit from digital experiences, similar to Roblox. At the same time, the rise of 3D platforms, virtual markets, and gaming worlds drives investment. In 2024, the global video streaming market‚Äîcrucial for immersive media‚Äîhit $674.25 billion.The Business Research Companyreports that the global metaverse market is predicted to grow from $227.05 billion in 2024 to $316.34 billion in 2025, with a strong 39.3% CAGR. Whereas,S&P GlobalMarketIntelligencepredicts that global metaverse revenue will climb from $17.5 billion in 2023 to $54.5 billion by 2028, growing at a 25.5% CAGR. Businesses became the main customer segment, driven by the need for digital twin software and remote collaboration tools. According toS&P, these businesses strengthened their position in 2023, accounting for 42.8% of the entire metaverse market. As major companies expand virtual platforms and adopt faster streaming, metaverse services strengthen across industries. Moreover, social media and mobile internet have sped up the growth of the virtual ecosystem. With over 2.4 billion users on Meta (previously Facebook) and billions more on WhatsApp and YouTube, the digital world is more connected than ever. The line between digital and physical life keeps blurring as many daily activities‚Äîhanging out, entertainment, shopping‚Äîare already happening in early metaverse settings. This has sparked the development of virtual learning, workplace collaborative tools, and blockchain-based gaming economies. According toNewGenApps, VR and AR gaming is set to reach 216 million players worldwide by 2025, with a market worth $11.6 billion. Markedly, a 2024 survey revealed that 34% of game developers globally are creating titles for the Meta Quest Store, a digital marketplace, showing strong developer interest in immersive gaming platforms. Furthermore, generative AI is reshaping the next phase of the metaverse, ranging from custom content suggestions to auto-dubbing, editing, and better visuals. Streaming platforms now use large language models like GPT-4 to create real-time content and ensure moderation, making digital interactions safer and more accessible. Although the broader metaverse is still under development, technologies powering virtual economies‚Äîsuch as play-to-earn games, NFT marketplaces, and digital event tickets‚Äîalready create income opportunities for users and developers. TheEntertainment Software Associationreported that 227 million Americans play video games every week, with an average age of 31. This shows a growing mainstream adoption of immersive content across different age groups. The combination of AI with VR/AR is helping platforms expand beyond gaming and entertainment into healthcare and business applications. As users want more personalized, high-resolution experiences, metaverse tech is advancing on low-latency infrastructures. Platforms like hesp.live are changing streaming with super-fast delivery for gaming, education, and live shopping. Initially, the metaverse faced a lot of backlash due to a not-so-appealing experience and inability to connect with users. Despite less public buzz after 2022, progress hasn‚Äôt stopped‚Äîthe metaverse is young, with ongoing improvements pushing it forward. These advances, plus the growing demand for video-on-demand services, show how deeply the metaverse fits into digital viewing habits. As North America leads the market, with major players and high digital spending, Asia Pacific is also set for future growth due to the quick adoption of immersive tech. This shows that the metaverse isn‚Äôt just a passing trend‚Äîit is a fundamental shift changing how people live, talk, and connect in digital spaces. As immersive environments disrupt traditional media, the metaverse is becoming a promising investment. To compile our list of the 12 Best Metaverse Stocks to Invest in, we first conducted extensive research to identify companies with significant exposure to the metaverse technology. First, we used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies.

Apr. 11 close at 5,358.75 - Apr. 17 close at 5,282.70 üî¥

Day-by-Day Standouts;

üî∏ Monday: The week started an optimism due to some hopes for pausing in tech tariffs especially on smartphones and certain electronics. The indexes lost gains by noon, but it was able to close slightly higher. Citigroup downgrades U.S. equities and set a target value at 5,800 down from the previous estimate of 6,500 due to tariff concerns. This makes it the 3rd brokerages after Goldman Sachs and BofA. üü¢

üî∏ Tuesday: The indexes were neutral in the morning. The White House announced two important actions. First one was maintaning its position with Canada. Second one was that China needs to make a deal with the U.S. Additionally, healthcare stocks were under selling pressure due to signals of upcoming tariffs from Trump. By the end of the day, the indexes closed slightly lower. üî¥

üî∏ Wednesday: Here we go. Before the session, retail sales data was released and beat expectations. We also heard several new updates about tariffs. The White House is considering increasing the tariff rate on China by 245%. However, China has stated that they open to talks if Trump respects them. Nvidia dropped due to their new H20 chips beings blocked from sale in China. The company's current H100 chips are already banned in there. As a result, the stock dropped more than 7%. This had an effect on the indexes. And the bad news did not stop there. Fed Chair Powell says that ""The Fed will wait on rate cuts"". Of course, the stock market did not like and continued tumbling. The probability of a rate cut in May is below 15% now, but June still shows more than 50% for chance of a 25 point rate cut. The indexes dropped more than 2%. üî¥

üî∏ Thursday: The decline did not continue from yesterday. Trump said that had a very productive call with the President of Mexico yesterday. He also said Japan wants to negotiate. These two positive updates effected positively on the stock market. Later on Thursday, Trump said 'He‚Äôll leave. If I ask him to, he‚Äôll be out of there. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs doing the job."" As a result, the indexes lost their gains, but still closed slightly higher. üü¢

Trump believes in lowering rates to reduce inflation. What do you think about this and its effect on the stock market? What will do the Fed or Jerome Powell? How was your week? What's your prediction for next week?

My summary ends here, but many people have asked about tools that I use. I wanted to copy from my previous post into this section. If you're not interested, feel free to skip this part. :)

üî∏ Stock+: It's a mobile app where I take my screenshots. I'm using it on my iPhone and iPad. It's available on the App Store. It has an orange icon. If you're using Android, you can try to search ""Heat map"" or ""Stock map"" on the Google Play. I don't know that this app available on the Google Play, but you can find alternatives.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. In his latest appearance on CNBC‚ÄôsSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer highlighted the often-overlooked role of currency fluctuations and explained why a weaker U.S. dollar might actually benefit American companies: ‚ÄúThe tariffs are going to be offset by the weak dollar. People forget that. And weak dollar‚Äôs good. We have a lot of people who work at the network who think weak dollar‚Äôs bad.

As the conversation shifted toward geopolitical risks and the strategic rivalry with China, Cramer referenced the bookDeath by Chinato illustrate fears about China‚Äôs technological dominance and the potential consequences for U.S. national security: ‚ÄúLook, in 2011, I got Death by China. When you stop, and the book is about Navarro, and it‚Äôs basically about World War III. He doesn‚Äôt mention that. I‚Äôm adding that. Graham Allison talks about World War III. He was one of my professors. So, hey, listen up. You can‚Äôt even, so it‚Äôs not even stock right now, but Death by China just talks about their grand plan to take us over. And when you go back and read it, it‚Äôs more cogent than you thought. It‚Äôs like Ghost Ship, which is one that Mark Benioff gave me about how our Navy eventually is going to be made of all Chinese chips and we go to use it against the Chinese and nothing happens.‚Äù While discussing the increasing competition between American and Chinese companies, Jim Cramer re-affirmed his position that the U.S. is still very much ahead of China, saying: ‚ÄúI think that there should be a great competition and real arms race. We shouldn‚Äôt be helping them and let‚Äôs see who wins. [‚Ä¶] Look, I think that we‚Äôre unbelievably great. We‚Äôre well ahead in scale. I don‚Äôt trust the Chinese.

Jim Cramer defended CEO Jensen Huang and emphasized Nvidia‚Äôs critical role in both AI and military applications. Here‚Äôs what he said: ‚ÄúLook at that NPR report, April 8th, that said, look, they‚Äôre probably going to be OK. I think they‚Äôre holding their breath and they felt that they would be OK.

Investors are strapping in for another big post-earnings stock move in the EV maker's shares. Options pricing suggests traders expect Tesla (TSLA) stock to move approximately 9.3% in either direction in the days after its report. A move of that magnitude would put Tesla stock in a range of $263.82 to $218.92; it closed Thursday around $241. Tesla has historically been among the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500 aroundearningsreleases. Over the past four quarters, its stock has averaged a 12.3% move the day after reporting earnings.The range of post-earnings moves is wide‚Äîshares jumped nearly 22% after reporting last October and slumped more than 12% in the prior quarter. Investors are heading into this earnings season mired in uncertainty. President Trump haspaused most of the tariffshe announced earlier this month, but has left in place massive duties on Chinese goods and made conflicting statements about being open to exemptions. Economic data has remained strong, but some economists warn that damage from tariffs isbound to show upeventually. According to JPMorgan analysts, the options market is pricing in some of the largest average implied moves around earnings since the first quarter of 2020. For Tesla, sales have fallen across the globe, weighed down by aconsumer backlashto CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs verbal and financial support of international far-right movements. Analysts and investors, meanwhile, have voiced concerns that Musk‚Äôs work with the White Houseis distracting himfrom leadinghis companies. Tesla‚Äôs access to foreign markets, meanwhile, is at risk of becoming a bargaining chip for other countries negotiating trade deals with Trump. Tesla's shares nearly doubled in the month and a halfafter Trump won re-electionwith Musk‚Äôs backing. They have since tumbled about 50%, putting them back where they were before Election Day. With Tesla‚Äôs EV sales under pressure, investors will be looking for encouraging updates on artificial intelligence, seen as its next growth driver.

2025-04-20 11:37:00,2 Semiconductor Stocks That Could Help Make You a Fortune,"Let's not beat around the silicon bush.Semiconductor stockshave made many investors very wealthy over the years. From the industry's inception in the 1970s and the personal computer boom of the next two decades to the internet, smartphones, and the ongoing artificial intelligence rush, the hardware that made it all possible often turned out to be a great investment. And it's not too late to get in on the semiconductor opportunity. Recent market darlings likeNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)might be running low on long-term growth fuel at this point, but there are many smaller names available. I'm particularly interested inNXP Semiconductors(NXPI1.29%)andCirrus Logic(CRUS0.14%)right now. These two chip stocks seem poised to deliver wealth-building returns in the next few years. Here's how. Dutch-AmericanchipmakerNXP's stock is down by 18% in 2025. The stock has generally followed theS&P 500chart over the last seven years, dating back to the canceled merger with larger peerQualcomm. The recent volatility and price drops make perfect sense, given the unpredictable state of international trade. With only 14% of its 2024 revenues collected directly from American customers but 36% from Chinese sources, NXP is quite sensitive to foreign trade disruption. The car market is especially important, accounting for 57% of last year's sales and some of NXP's strongest top-line growth. I'm sure you'll hear more about the tariff threat and international tensions in next week's first-quarter earnings call.¬†It may be prudent to wait for the April 28 event before taking action on this stock. However, the stock looks undervalued after the trade-related price drops. NXP's shares are trading at just 17.5 times adjusted earnings and 14.4times forward-looking earnings estimates-- near two-year lows on both metrics. So, it looks like the market makers have already accounted for a massive slowdown in NXP's business as the tariff tension plays out. I'm not saying that the stock can't fall any further, but it already strikes me as an affordable bet on edge computing and increasingly computerized vehicles. I can't wait to see NXP's business and stock spring back to lifein the next macroeconomic upswing. Then there's Cirrus Logic. The maker of power controllers and high-quality audio chips is trading at just 15.5 times adjusted earnings and 12.5 times forward earnings. These multiyear lows make even NXP look pricy in comparison. This company is best known for being a longtimeApple(AAPL1.36%)supplier. Since time immemorial, its audio circuits have been found in iPhones and iPads,¬† as well as the original iPods. So, any market adjustments that are bad news for Apple could be even worse to Cirrus Logic and its investors. However, the company is expanding its market reach nowadays. Cirrus Logic controllers are finally found in several high-end smartphones and laptops that Apple does not make. It also supplies more parts to the devices it has already populated, adding functions such as haptic feedback and battery management processors. The long-standingApplerelationship is a respectable stamp of quality approval, given Cupertino's refined hardware standards and tight requirements. It shouldn't be hard to find clients in the PC and Android worlds from that starting point. In all fairness, I've been saying that for years. The difference is that Cirrus Logic has started to turn that diversified dream into a reality. Like NXP, Cirrus Logic has been dragged down to a rock-bottom valuation by bearish market vibes. I don't think that's fair, given the company's market expansion success. The tariff-struggle era may be painful, but you should buy when there's blood in the streets. If you're worried about starting your position at an imperfect price point, you couldbuy the stock in thirdsover a period of time. If prices go up, you've started early. If they head downward, you'll buy the next tranche at a lower price.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/20/2-semiconductor-stocks-that-could-make-you-money/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=87201e18-259d-4da4-997c-dc55cdf9d9dc&.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-20 12:00:00,"Down 45%, Should You Buy the Dip on Intel?","Even before the market sell-off,Intel's(INTC-1.61%)stock struggled. That perhaps should be no surprise. The semiconductor company has been largely left behind in theartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure build-out mania, while its foundry ambitions have floundered. Meanwhile, past acquisitions by and large haven't panned out. Intel stock is down 45% in the last year. Can a new CEO on board help turn around the company and boost the stock? Intel named a new CEO last month, tapping long-term industry vet Lip-Bu Tan to run the struggling company. Tan previously served as CEO atCadence Design Systems, which provides software and hardware for electronic design automation. He previously served on Intel's board of directors until stepping down last year. Tan's turnaround plans appear to be focused on revitalizing the company's efforts in AI chips, improving its foundry business, and streamlining the company. Those first two steps will not be easy. Intel's market share in thegraphic processing unit (GPU)space is virtually zero at this point, with it well behind not only leaderNvidiabutAdvanced Micro Devicesas well. The company tried multiple times to create a GPU to compete against Nvidia, only to fail in the process. Intel's latest setback occurred earlier this year when it scrapped its plans to bring its Falcon Shores GPU to the market, instead deciding to use it only as an internal test chip. As last reported, the company has turned its focus to its Jaguar Shores GPU, which it is deigning specifically forAI inferenceand high-performance computing. It appears the chip will be part of a broader rack-scale system, not just an individual chip. Nonetheless, making inroads against Nvidia will be difficult. The GPU leader created a wide moat through its CUDA software platform, which it developed to let its chips be programmed for tasks beyond their original purpose of speeding up graphics rendering in video games. However, in the years since, it built a collection of libraries and services on top of CUDA, centered on AI and high-performance computing that help accelerate AI training and speed up inference. With developers already trained on programming GPUs through CUDA and the software continuing to improve, taking any significant market share away from Nvidia seems highly unlikely. While there has been a lot of talk of Intel looking to spin off its foundry business, this does not look to be in the cards currently. For one, the money the company has received as part of the CHIPS Act to build out new semiconductor manufacturing facilities, or fabs, is predicated on Intel keeping a majority stake in the foundry business. Second, on its own, the foundry business might go bankrupt. Intel poured a ton of money into building new manufacturing capacity, but the unit continues to pile up the losses. In 2024, Foundry segment revenue fell 7%, while it produced a $13.4 billion loss. RivalTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, meanwhile, is reportedly in talks with Intel to run its fabs through a joint venture in exchange for a 20% stake. Intel has also been betting big that its new 18A process can help turn around its foundry operations. Earlier this month, the company entered risk production, which is the stage before mass production to access yield rates and any flaws. It has had production issues with this new process in the past, so this is good news. Image source: Getty Images Intel still has an uphill battle to turn itself around. However, the company owns a lot of physical assets with its foundry business, where it has spent nearly $50 billion the past two years incapital expenditures(capex). Meanwhile, its core products business did modestly grow revenue by 3% last year. That's not great, but it's also not a business in free fall. In addition, the company can sell noncore assets. This includes Altera, which the company just announced it is selling a 51% stake in to private equity company Silver Lake for $4.46 billion. Intel will keep the remaining 49% of the company. The deal values Altera in its entirety at $8.75 billion, which is nearly half the $16.7 billion it paid for the company in 2025. It also owns an over 88% stake inMobileye. While also well below the $15.3 billion it paid for the company, it still also has value. Trading at a price-to-tangiblebook valueratio of 1.2 times, Intel stock is trading just above the physical value of its assets. Given that many of its foundry assets are pretty new, I think that valuation is cheap enough to take a chance on the stock at these levels. A turnaround might not be fully coming, but there should be levers available to unlock value and help increase the stock price.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/20/down-45-should-you-buy-the-dip-on-intel/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=2ef42e6c-1e13-4a30-97ca-a70dd9a8e751&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-20 12:00:00,"Google, Tesla, and IBM earnings lead a make-or-break week for stocks","Shaken by geopolitical shocks, the S&P 500 was flat last week and the Nasdaq nosed just into the red ‚Äî but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished significantly lower, weighed down by a double blow from UnitedHealth (UNH) and Nvidia (NVDA). UnitedHealth slashed its full-year forecast after a rough quarter, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping nearly 7% after reports of a new U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China. Thursday‚Äôs further drop pushed Nvidia‚Äôs market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. It wasn‚Äôt all red arrows. Hertz (HTZ) soared after Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman revealed a sizable stake in the rental car firm ‚Äî a bullish bet on a company still recovering from post-pandemic headwinds. Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped after announcing that its experimental weight-loss pill cleared a key late-stage trial, strengthening its position in the lucrative obesity drug market. Investors now look ahead to a packed week of earnings and economic data, with Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA), AbbVie (ABBV), and Procter & Gamble (PG) all set to report ‚Äî alongside key releases on PMI, jobless claims, and the Fed‚Äôs closely watched Beige Book. Tesla‚Äôs results are set to kick things off Tuesday, and the company‚Äôs earnings will be one of the most closely watched reports of the week, with signs pointing to a potential tough quarter. Vehicle registrations in California ‚Äî Tesla‚Äôs largest U.S. market ‚Äî fell more than 15% year-over-year, marking a sixth straight quarterly decline. The company‚Äôs share of the state‚Äôs EV market also dropped sharply amid growing competition, an aging product lineup, and the controversial public image of CEO Elon Musk. Also on deck: SAP (SAP) and Novartis (NVS), two European heavyweights that will test investor confidence in multinationals navigating weak demand and shifting interest rate policy. GE Aerospace (GE) offers a read on global defense and aviation spending, while Verizon‚Äôs (VZ) results could reveal whether telecom providers are holding the line on customer growth and capital costs. Other names to watch include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Danaher (DHR), which will offer clues on whether momentum in medical technology is holding up. Chubb (CB) and Lockheed Martin round out the day, with updates from the insurance and defense sectors ‚Äî both of which tend to attract investors during periods of economic uncertainty. IBM (IBM) and AT&T (T) will be in focus as bellwethers for enterprise tech and telecom ‚Äî sectors that have promised stability but face rising pressure to cut costs and defend margins. Boeing also reports, with investors watching for updates on aircraft deliveries and production pace. The company now faces a fresh geopolitical headwind: reports that China has asked its airlines to halt Boeing orders, thrusting the U.S. aerospace giant into the center of escalating trade tensions. While the move won‚Äôt impact this quarter‚Äôs results, it raises new questions about the strength of Boeing‚Äôs international order book and the outlook for global demand. Markets will also be parsing April‚Äôs flash PMI data on Wednesday ‚Äî key readings on both the services and manufacturing sectors, which may reveal whether the economy is cooling fast enough for the Fed‚Äôs comfort. Later that day, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Beige Book lands. Published eight times a year, the Beige Book compiles anecdotal reports from businesses across the country, offering a ground-level look at wage pressures, hiring, and consumer demand. It‚Äôs less about hard numbers and more about vibes. Alphabet will report earnings under the shadow of a major legal setback. A U.S. federal judge just ruled that the Department of Justice‚Äôs antitrust case against Google‚Äôs ad tech business can proceed, rejecting the company‚Äôs effort to have it thrown out. The lawsuit, which could ultimately force a breakup of Google‚Äôs advertising operations, adds a layer of uncertainty to a business already under pressure. While investors are hoping to see continued AI progress and cost control, shares remain down about 20% this year. Procter & Gamble, Merck (MRK), T-Mobile (TMUS), and PepsiCo (PEP) all report Thursday, too, offering a cross-sector pulse check on consumer spending, pricing power, and healthcare demand. Also reporting: Union Pacific (UNP), Gilead (GILD), and Comcast (CMCSA), bringing updates on freight volumes, drug pipelines, and broadband subscriber trends. You can also expect fresh signals on the health of the labor market and business spending, with jobless claims and durable goods orders both hitting at 8:30 a.m. ET. The numbers could either bolster hopes for rate cuts or cement the Fed‚Äôs cautious stance. It‚Äôs a fitting end to a high-stakes week: earnings from Charter (CHTR), Aon (AON), and HCA (HCA) will spotlight momentum in media, insurance, and healthcare, while AbbVie, Colgate (CL), and a cross-section of energy and services firms round out the picture.

2025-04-20 13:30:15,Why the latest stock market pullback feels right,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings It wasn't whatwassaid, but whatwasn'tsaid. That's what I have been telling the CEOs who have reached out following my chat with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentearlier this week(video above). I very much enjoyed my 23-minute chat with the secretary, full-stop. I learned a lot in a short period and greatly appreciated his time. He is level-headed and deeply understands market history and market plumbing ‚Äî no doubt a by-product of his decades spent in the hedge fund industry. Of course, these are good traits to have as a Treasury secretary if things go to hell in a handbasket (see the Great Financial Crisis). But at the end of the day, I came away thinking the cloud of uncertainty hanging over markets on tariff policy ‚Äî a key market headwind ‚Äî should remain in place in the near term. Consequently, any rallies in stocks like we saw after therecent electronics tariff exclusionsshould be treated as short-lived. Read more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs In the center of this uncertainty cloud is, naturally, China. The two superpowers seem light-years apart in calling some form of trade truce. When I asked the secretary if he had talked to his Chinese counterpart, this is what he replied: ""We did an introductory call a couple of months ago. We haven't spoken since. I'm not sure who from PRC [People's Republic of China] will be [here] next week ‚Äî it's a big week in Washington. It's the International Monetary Fund World Bank Week. So I know that the People's Republic will send someone from finance, probably the PBOC, People's Bank of China governor. So they will be here. You know, I may bump into them. We don't have anything scheduled,"" Bessent said. Wow, bump into them in a hallway? That's where things are at? Not great. Then there was this response to whether tariff deals will be inked with up to 130 countries by the time the 90-day pause ends: ""Let's set aside China. There are 15 large trading partners. We set aside China. There are 14, and we're in rapid motion and setting up a process for the 14 largest trading partners, most of whom have very large deficits. So, in 90 days, are we going to have a complete doc, a formal legal document done and dusted? Not likely,"" Bessent said. However, he did note that aframework could be worked outwithin the pause period. As all of this is playing out, the administration is still clamping down on relations with China. See this week's AI chip restriction news thatrattled the market capsof AI leaders Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Nvidia will be forced to take a $5.5 billion charge and AMD an $800 million one. It's a tough pill for investors to stomach. It underscores the degree of policy risk that still isn't priced into the markets, even if the bulls suggest otherwise. On the heels of this interview, I'll be talking to a large number of CEOs over the next two weeks. Some right after their earnings calls, some before them (which you can nowlistento straight on Yahoo Finance!), and others over a drink. I am curious what you want to know from these power brokers. I, for one, am keen to understand how execs plan to price their products and services in the era of tariffs. It could have major ramifications for consumer demand and Fed policy this year. And I'm also looking to see how committed they are to current staffing levels in this uncertain environment. If a company is forced to pay a big tariff at the same time as consumers pull back, best believe CEOs are going to slice fat off the expense line ‚Äî that usually comes by way of canning workers.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top 10 AI stocks in the spotlight this week. According to investment firm Morgan Stanley, electricity demand is going to prove to be resilient regardless of any recession that may come into play from Trump‚Äôs tariff policies. This is because data centers need a lot of power, and demand will not go down despite a downturn or because of efficiency gains from Ant Group, DeepSeek, and others. While it is true that industrial demand may dip in the short term, bringing manufacturing back to the US will help solve this problem. ‚ÄúWe believe power demand trends are more durable than in prior cycles, in part due to the inelasticity of data center demand. Industrial demand could decline in the near term, but reshoring of manufacturing is a long-term tailwind.‚Äù READ ALSO:10 AI Stocks Surging on News Todayand10 AI Stocks You Shouldn‚Äôt Overlook Right Now. A similar analysis by aBloombergreport forecast that US power demand coming from data centers could swell 20-40% in 2025, with strong double-digit growth likely to persist in 2026-30. While Morgan Stanley does acknowledge that rapid policy changes may have deep implications for large capital investments, it also forecasts electricity consumption from artificial intelligence growing tenfold by 2028. ‚ÄúWith this in mind, we do not want to minimize the risk of a near-term ‚Äòshock‚Äô in demand. This could translate into slowing order growth for some companies.‚Äù History has shown energy stocks to remain resilient despite economic downturns. The firm noted how, since 1960, demand has fallen by just 0.2% on average during such periods. ‚ÄúUtilities screen favorable in a recession given their defensive nature,‚Äù That said, it is optimistic about strong spending on AI infrastructure from tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet.

2025-04-20 16:11:00,Stock Market Sell-Off: 2 Stocks That Could Double in 2 Years,"There's no shortage of uncertainty in the stock market these days. Investors have been left scratching their heads after President Trump announced global tariffs on April 2, then put the ""reciprocal"" tariffs with most of the world on pause for 90 days, stepped up a trade war with China, and has since flip-flopped on duties on tariffs on electronics while saying he may pull back tariffs on autos. As a result, theS&P 500(^GSPC0.13%)is now in a correction, defined as a decline of at least 10% from a recent peak. While investors may be nervous about the trade war and the increasing risk of a recession, long-term investors know that sell-offs represent buying opportunities as quality businesses just got cheaper. On that note, let's take a look at two beaten-down stocks that could double over the next two years. Image source: Getty Images. Investors can't run away fromTarget(TGT2.93%)fast enough, it seems. Shares of the venerable retailer are now down 65% from their peak during the pandemic, and it's understandable why. Target has struggled to grow since the end of the pandemic as consumer discretionary spending has been weak, its pandemic momentum faded, and it's been plagued by internal problems like theft. The company just capped off a year with flat comparable sales and earnings per share. Target also expects no growth in earnings per share this year, forecasting a range of $8.80 to $8.90 with flat comparable sales and revenue growth. However, those headwinds now seem fully priced in as Target'sprice-to-earnings ratiohas fallen to just 10.5. At that valuation, the stock could double with no change in earnings, and it would still trade at a discount to the S&P 500. Target's valuation isn't going to jump on its own, but the company has a plan to reinvigorate the brand. That includes leaning further into its owned brands like Cat & Jack, its kids' apparel line, and All in Motion, its athleisure brand, which have delivered solid growth. It aims to regain its ""Tarzhet"" brand magic, or its cheap chic reputation that it seems to have gotten away from in recent years. The company also plans new store openings and remodels and expects to add at least $15 billion in sales over the next five years. The company's earnings are currently well below their peak a few years ago, meaning that if Target can get back to its previous health, the stock could soar. It may need some help from the macroeconomic environment to double, but if the company shows signs of improvement, the stock has a lot of upside potential. Another stock trading at a discount that has a lot of room to run right now isMicron(MU-0.77%), the leading maker of computer memory chips. Micron's business is highly cyclical as prices for memory chips can change rapidly, as we saw in 2022 when smartphone sales tumbled and there was a glut in the industry. However, Micron is now in a much stronger position than it was back then, as it's clearly benefiting from the AI boom. In its most recent quarter, its data center revenue more than doubled, pacing its overall revenue growth at 38%. Micron's biggest customer is nowNvidia, and this company has become a key partner of the AI chip leader. Micron could be impacted by the economic headwinds stemming from the trade war, but the growth in AI should continue as the big tech companies driving that spending recognize that it's essential not to fall behind in AI. Micron now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 10 based on its expected earnings. Like Target, the malaise priced into Micron's stock seems excessive, and it shouldn't take much for the stock to move higher from here, though the macro climate is likely to weigh on the stock. If the company can just hit current analyst expectations over the coming quarters, which call for $11.08 in adjusted EPS next fiscal year, its stock chart should go sharply upward. Given Micron's low valuation and rapid business growth, a double is certainly reachable over the next two years.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/20/stock-market-sell-off-2-stocks-that-could-double-i/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8a9a819c-78f3-403c-88dc-0d0e66904418&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-20 20:00:00,Nvidia Stock: The Week of April 14-18 in Review,"Shares ofNvidia(NVDA-3.01%), the leading maker ofartificial intelligence (AI)chips, dropped 8.5% last week, which was a four-day trading week due to the stock market being closed for the Good Friday holiday. Nvidia stock ended the week priced at $101.49 per share. For context, last week, theS&P 500index declined by 1.5% while the tech-heavyNasdaq Compositeindex fell 2.6%. For additional context, shares of Nvidia competitorAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD) were down 6.3%. Below is a discussion of the two major events that moved Nvidia stock last week.  Data by YCharts. Nvidia stock edged up 1.3% on Tuesday, a day that the S&P 500 slipped by about 0.2%. Investors liked the news the company announced in a Monday blog post, that it's ""working with its manufacturing partners to design and build factories that, for the first time, will produce Nvidia AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S."" Within four years, it plans to produce up to $500 billion of AIinfrastructurein the U.S. through partnerships with several companies. Specifically, Nvidia has started producing its new Blackwell chips atTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's(TSM0.13%)plants in Phoenix, Arizona. TSMC is the world's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors. It's long been Nvidia's primary chip manufacturing partner. Moreover, Nvidia is also ""partnering withAmkorand SPIL [Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd.] for packaging and testing operations"" in the state. In addition, Nvidia is building two supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas: one withFoxconnin Houston and a second with Wistron in Dallas. ""Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months,"" according to the blog post. Nvidia stock fell 6.9% on Wednesday, following the tech giant's Tuesday night disclosure via a filing with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)that it plans to take charges of up to $5.5 billion on its fiscal first-quarter results. The charges stem from the U.S. government enacting restrictions on the export of its H20 chip to China and select other countries. The H20-associated charges are for products in inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. In other words, Nvidia has purchase orders from Chinese companies for these chips that it doesn't believe it will be able to fulfill, and it has an inventory of these chips that it either won't be able to sell or would have to sell at significant discounts. (Demand for these chips would be low from Nvidia's major customers in the U.S. and other countries not subject to the new export controls. Such companies are buying Nvidia's most powerful Hopper and Blackwell chips.) Nvidia stock continued to decline on Thursday. This latest move by the U.S. government marks the second expansion round of the August 2022 export controls on chips and systems fordata centerscapable of handling advanced AI workloads. The first expansion occurred in October 2023. The restrictions are due to national and international security concerns. The October 2023 expansion affected a substantial number of Nvidia's products within its data center platform, which accounts for the bulk of its revenue. (Data center revenue accounted for 90.6% of the company's total revenue in its most recently reported quarter.)¬†Following this expansion,Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip as a then-export control-compliant chip for the Chinese market, which has historically been a substantial market for the company. The H20 is a powerful chip, but not as powerful as Nvidia's most advanced chips. In other words, the goalpost keeps moving for what chips Nvidia is restricted from exporting to China and other unfriendly countries. As to specifics, Nvidia said in its filing that on April 9, the U.S. government informed it that a license would be required for the export of the H20 chip to China and select other countries. The government indicated that the license requirement stems from the risk that the H20 could be used in a supercomputer in China. Furthermore, the filing stated that Nvidia was notified on April 14 that the license requirement would remain in effect for the ""indefinite future."" The license requirement essentially amounts to a ban. To my knowledge, there have been no published reports of the U.S. government issuing a license to Nvidia or other affected chipmakers that would permit them to supplychipsincluded in the export controls to China or other affected countries. The key question for investors is how much the new export controls will affect Nvidia's financial results.¬†Nvidia's first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ends on April 27, 2025. The company has already announced its earnings release date, which is after the market closes on Wednesday, May 28. For fiscal Q1, Nvidia had guided for revenue of $43 billion, which translates to 65% year-over-year growth and 9.4% sequential growth. So, $5.5 billion in H20-related charges amounts to 12.8% of the company's forecasted revenue. Nvidia just about always beats itsguidance, so it's probably safe to assume it will generate revenue of, let's say, $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion before accounting for the charges. Assuming Nvidia would have taken in revenue of $44 billion, excluding the charges, its revenue would be about $38.5 billion with the charges included. How does $38.5 billion in revenue stack up to the results for the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter? Last quarter (Q4 of fiscal 2025), Nvidia's revenue was $39.33 billion. So, it seems likely that Nvidia's fiscal Q1 revenue will probably be slightly lower than last quarter's, with the best-case scenario being revenue comparable to that of last quarter. In the year-ago period (Q1 of fiscal 2025), Nvidia's revenue was $26.04 billion. So, if we assume the company's fiscal Q1 2026 revenue will be roughly $38.5 billion, year-over-year growth will be about 48%. While that's quite a bit lower than 65%-plus, it would still be darn good annual growth! Of course, the $5.5 billion in charges will also hurt Nvidia'snet income, or earnings. This effect is not quantifiable because the company doesn't break out any form of profit (such as operating income or net income) by its target market platforms (e.g., data centers, gaming, professional visualization, auto/robotics). However, we know from prior management comments that the data center platform's profitability is greater than the company's overall profitability. So, it's probably safe to assume that the hit to the company's net income will be greater than the roughly 12% to 13% reduction in revenue. I won't mince words: The H20 charges are going to significantly hurt Nvidia's fiscal Q1 results and will likely significantly hurt the company's results for at least a few more quarters. Without its H20 chip, Nvidia will have a very challenging time competing in the data center market in China. Therefore, investors can likely expect Chinese data center revenue to decline significantly. That said, there are good reasons to remain very bullish on Nvidia stock as a long-term investment. The company's total addressable geographic market remains massive, even without China. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the market leader, by far, for AI chips for both training and inferencing (running AI applications), with demand extremely strong. Moreover, the next phases of AI --agentic AIand physical AI (such as self-driving vehicles androbots) -- are in the early stages of rapid growth. Investors should keep the big picture in mind: Granted, Nvidia stock is down 32% from its all-time closing high of $149.43, reached on Jan. 6 of this year, but it's still up 19.9% from a year ago. Meanwhile, the broader market, as proxied by the S&P 500, has returned 6.9% over the last year.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/20/nvda-stock-price-china-chip-ban-us-ai-investment/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=df03c5b5-685a-47a0-9b98-01f3c4a4f68b&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-20 23:00:00,1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Buyback Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist During the Nasdaq Sell-Off,"Ever since President Donald Trump announced a new tariff agenda on April 2, the stock market has been experiencing outsized volatility. Technology stocks in particular have been vulnerable to widespread selling, driven by fear and uncertainty. Since the tariffs were announced earlier this month, theNasdaq Compositehas fallen 7.5% as of April 18. One Nasdaq stock that initially took a big hit following the tariff news is semiconductor companyBroadcom(AVGO-2.19%). Shares fell as much as 20% before rebounding, and they're actually down less than 1% as of this writing. One of the biggest contributors to the stock's recovery was the company's recentstock buybackannouncement. According to management, the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to $10 billion in shares through Dec. 31. Let's explore what may have compelled management to explore a buyback and why investors may want to consider adding shares right now. I see these tariff policies as a mechanism for the U.S. to negotiate new trade deals. In the near term, a situation like this can cause chaos in the investment world. There are a lot of unknowns about which countries are currently discussing new trade deals with the Trump administration and where these various negotiations stand. However, smart investors know better than to get too distracted by the constantly changing tariff rhetoric. Rather, let's look at some of theseculartailwinds in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry and explore why the moves that big tech is making bode well for Broadcom. Image source: Getty Images. Despite the recovery in Broadcom shares over the last two weeks, the stock is still down 26% so far this year.  Data byYCharts. Stock buybacks can sometimes be interpreted as a sign that management believes shares are undervalued. As the chart above illustrates, the ongoing sell-off in Broadcom has brought the company's valuation to its lowest level in about a year based on aforward price-to-earnings(P/E) multiple. The valuation compression seen above might suggest the stock is oversold, but I see a more subtle reason to pounce on shares right now. Buyback programs can take several quarters, or even years, to complete. But as mentioned above, Broadcom's current $10 billion repurchase program only runs through the end of the year. Whether the company buys back the full $10 billion or not, it's highly likely management will be repurchase some shares over the next eight months as long as they remain depressed compared to historical levels. When you also factor in Broadcom's robust prospects thanks to ongoing infrastructure and data center spending by AI's biggest leaders, the stock ends up looking like a bargain right now. Despite the near-term volatility from tariffs, now is an opportunity to buy the dip in this leading AI growth stock.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/20/1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-buyback-stock-t/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8d19abc5-ea58-4691-acd6-a4b9f2df3633&.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-21 01:30:39,"Big Tech's ""Magnificent Seven"" heads into earnings season reeling from Trump turbulence","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ‚Äî As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago. Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid anonslaught of tariffsand other potentially detrimental actions. It's the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when theyassembled behind Trumpas he was sworn in. That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunitiesin artificial intelligenceanddeal-making. But the Trump administration‚Äôs policies so far have vexed Big Tech‚Äôs ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù companies ‚Äî a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump‚Äôs inauguration, the Magnificent Seven‚Äôs combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20. The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump‚Äôs April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived. That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world. ‚ÄúThe mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,‚Äù Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump's tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators' allegations thatMeta has been running an illegal monopolyin social networking, and working to persuade a federal judgeto break up Googleafter its search engine last year was found to beillegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that aim to hobbleAppleandAmazon. And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company torecord a $5.5 billion chargeto account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country. Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies‚Äô financial reports for the January-March quarter. The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that itsfirst-quarter car sales dropped by 13%from the same time last year. The decline occurred against a backdrop ofvandalism,widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycottamid a backlash to Musk‚Äôs high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies. After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla's market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: Amazon on April 29; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Apple on May 1. Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results.",News,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-magnificent-seven-heads-003039234.html?.tsrc=rss,4

2025-04-21 06:31:15,TSMC warns of limits of ability to keep its AI chips from China,"(Bloomberg) ‚Äî Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) listed the challenges of ensuring export control compliance by its customers, months after the company‚Äôs artificial intelligence silicon was found to have flowed to US-sanctioned Huawei Technologies Co. via intermediaries. Most Read from Bloomberg DOGE Visits National Gallery of Art to Discuss Museum‚Äôs Legal Status Trump Administration Takes Over New York Penn Station Revamp DOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed Nashville‚Äôs $3 Billion Transit Plan Brings a Call for Zoning Reform ‚ÄúTSMC‚Äôs role in the semiconductor supply chain inherently limits its visibility and information available to it regarding the downstream use or user of final products that incorporate semiconductors manufactured by it,‚Äù the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said in its latest annual report released on Friday. The world‚Äôs largest contract chipmaker said the constraint impedes its ability to prevent unintended end-uses of its semiconductors, as well as diverted shipments by business partners and third parties intent on circumventing sanctions. In terms of whether there are going to be compliance issues found, the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) said in the report there is ‚Äúno assurance,‚Äù despite TSMC‚Äôs best efforts to abide by relevant export control regulations. TSMC provides manufacturing services to many so-called fabless firms and chip designers including Nvidia. Very often the semiconductors it customizes for those companies will end up being incorporated in gadgets and devices made by third parties, most often for legitimate purposes. For instance, both Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and MediaTek Inc. (2454.TW) work with TSMC to make mobile chips used by phone makers including Xiaomi Corp. (XIACF,XIACY). However, an investigation by Canada-based research firm TechInsights last year showed that Huawei‚Äôs Ascend 910B AI chip contained semiconductors by TSMC. The chipmaker halted shipments to a client around the same time after it found out the semiconductors it made for the customer ended up with Huawei. TSMC alluded to the incident in the annual report and said it notified Washington and Taipei in October that a chip it made for a customer might have been diverted to a restricted entity. The chipmaker added it has been cooperating with authorities‚Äô requests for additional information and documents. The Trump administration has followed the footsteps of former US President Joe Biden in crimping the flow of advanced technologies to China out of national security concerns. The US earlier this month unveiled a fresh round of regulations to tighten China‚Äôs access to advanced AI chips. Earlier this year, Washington called for chip producers like TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. to step up their scrutiny and due diligence of customers, especially Chinese firms. US officials simultaneously blacklisted 16 Chinese companies including Sophgo Technologies Ltd., which was allegedly involved in Huawei getting access to TSMC chips last year. Together with Sophgo, the US also added PowerAir Pte to the entity list after the South China Morning Post reported concerns about the Singapore-based company‚Äôs possible involvement in diverting TSMC chips to Huawei.

2025-04-21 09:00:00,Prediction: Super Micro Computer Could Surge by 150% in the Next Year,"Sometimes, when a stock falls on hard times, investors sell and forget about it. But in the case of AI server specialistSuper Micro Computer(SMCI-1.19%), these naysayers could be missing out on a big resurgence. Most investors came to know Super Micro as one of the biggest artificial intelligence winners, at least through the first half of last year. That's before short-selling firm Hindenburg released an August 2024 report on the company accusing it of accounting manipulation, followed by Super Micro's auditor Ernst & Young resigning from auditing the company's books in October. On top of all of this, the AI trade appears to have come under further pressure, as investors fear the Trump administration's tariff policies could spur a recession and further limit AI sales to foreign countries. Despite all of this, Super Micro has actually refuted a lot of the allegations against it, and it's also very well positioned to capture the next wave of AI investment. Trading at a bargain basement valuation, here's how the stock could be amultibaggerover the next year. First, the best news for Super Micro is that its new auditor appears to have cleared its books as accurate, despite the resignation of former auditor Ernst & Young last October. After Ernst & Young resigned, Super Micro hired new auditor BDO late last year. And while BDO did deliver an adverse opinion on Super Micro's accounting controls and procedures, it also verified Super Micro's revenue and profit for 2024, 2023, and 2022 as accurate. It's likely that Ernst & Young got nervous regarding Super Micro's substandard back office controls, and decided to quit rather than remain as auditor. However, quitting instead of reverifying financials, as BDO did, seems like a step too far. Looking back on it, the abrupt resignation may have been due to Ernst & Young's having been embroiled in various scandals in recent years. In 2022, Ernst & Young had to pay $100 million fine after it was revealed hundreds of its auditors cheated on their CPA exams.  And in 2023, the European wing of of the company had to pay a 500,000 euro fine after its client Wirecard went bankrupt following years of accounting fraud while Ernst & Young was that company's auditor. Therefore, the auditing giant may have been scared off by Hindenburg's accusations and Super Micro's abnormal back office operations. In any case, the good news for shareholders is that Super Micro's hypergrowth over the past few years was confirmed by a major accounting firm. Super Micro is also currently upgrading its IT and accounting systems and procedures, while also looking for a new chief financial officer, which was one of the recommendations its board committee gave on the matter. On March 31, the company took another positive step with the appointment of Scott Angel to Super Micro'sboard of directors. Angel was a 37-year executive at Big 4 auditing firm Deloitte & Touche, where he specialized in risk and compliance issues, especially for technology firms. So, having Angel on the board, along with hiring a new and experienced CFO should go a long way toward cleaning up Super Micro's procedures going forward, which should put its accounting controversy to rest once and for all. Besides the accounting issues, Super Micro has more recently been dinged over fears of an AI infrastructure slowdown. But unless we experience a very severe global recession, it doesn't appear as though AI infrastructure investment will stop. Several hyperscale companiesrecently restated their spending plansfor 2025, even after the April 2 ""Liberation Day"" tariff reveal threw the global economy into a high amount of uncertainty. Moreover, with the prize of AI supremacy being so big, well-funded large-cap companies are unlikely to arrest their investments significantly. In its recent February report, technology research firm IDC sees AI servers growing at a 42% compound rate through 2028. That number seems to align with Super Micro CEO Charles Liang's recent forecast for 40% annual revenue growth in the medium term. While there are definitely economic headwinds to contend with this year, remember that successful AI deployment has the potential to greatly lower costs to corporations while also enhancing revenue opportunities. In lean times, it's possible major enterprises will lean even more heavily on AI technology. While growth is great, a final overarching concern among investors has been the lowergross marginSuper Micro has seen over the past year. Wall Street analysts have taken this as a sign of competition creeping in on Super Micro's first-to-market competitive advantage. To be sure, the AI server opportunity is large, and many competitors, includingDell(DELL1.82%), are also experiencing lower gross margins on AI servers relative to traditional ones. Over the past two years, Super Micro saw its gross margin dip from above 18% at the end of 2022 to just 11.8% last quarter.  SMCI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts But it's also possible a rebound for gross margin may be in the cards. As management explained on itsrecent earnings call with analysts, Super Micro is often first-to-market with new innovations, as it was withNvidia's(NVDA-3.01%)Hopper chip, which launched at the end of 2022. That first-to-market advantage with Hopper servers was why margins rallied above 18% at that point. However, we are now over two years past the launch of Hopper. That means in addition to customers perhaps slowing purchases of servers in recent quarters as they wait for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip, the competition has also developed Hopper solutions, which put pressure on Super Micro's gross margin. But Blackwell is just now beginning to ramp this quarter, and the introduction of a new technology could provide an opportunity for Super Micro to regain some lost gross margin. And with Nvidia now moving to a one-year cadence of new chip architectures, with its Rubin chip slated to come out in 2026, that more rapid pace of new technology introduction should benefit Super Micro and its first-to-market advantages. Of note, Super Micro's management has never altered its 14% to 17% long-term gross margin range. That was true when margins were above that range in 2022, and also when they were below that range more recently. Clearly, the market believes lower gross margins are here to stay. But if Super Micro increases gross margins back into its long-term range with the ramp of Blackwell servers, that could change the narrative. A final reason Super Micro could more than double over the next year is its bargain valuation. Super Micro's stock trades at just 13.7 times trailing earnings and eight times earnings estimates for fiscal 2026. That's far below the average multiple in the market, let alone a company experiencing AI-fueled growth. What's interesting about those 2026 estimates is that the average analyst estimate for revenue and EPS is only $33.5 billion and $3.65, respectively, with the most optimistic analyst anticipating $38.5 billion in revenue and $5 in EPS. However, Charles Liang noted on the prior earnings call he expects ""at least"" $40 billion in 2026 revenue. Should the company achieve that, with gross margins finding their way back to just 15%, in the lower part of Super Micro's long-term guidance range, that could yield a gross profit of $6 billion. Operating expenses appear to be on track for about $1.2 billion in fiscal 2025. If those increased to $1.6 billion in 2026, Super Micro would make about $4.4 billion in operating profit, which would translates to roughly $3.7 billion in 2026 net profit at the current tax rate Super Micro is paying, or about $5.65 per share. Even if one puts a meager 14 times multiple on those earnings -- and there's a good case Super Micro could see multiple expansion if it beats analyst targets -- that would bring its share price to $80 per share, more than 150% higher from where the stock is today.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/21/prediction-super-micro-computer-could-surge-by-150/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=a9a90177-a16c-4887-9532-03260bad69f9&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-21 09:10:00,3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before Earnings Season Heats Up,"Earnings season is here once again, offering us a look into our favorite companies' latest performance and view of the future. Investors may feel particularly eager to hear the thoughts of chief executive officers, considering the challenge facing U.S. companies today: President Trump's import tariff plan. Trump's tariff announcement earlier this monthdragged indexes loweras investors worried about higher prices on imports eating into corporate profits. This is particularly a concern in the tech industry as most players import materials and even finished goods from other countries. Though Trump placed an exemption on electronics, this may be temporary. So, as companies report earnings, investors will pay close attention to how they may handle potential tariffs to come. Does this mean you should hold off on buying tech stocks? Not at all. Tech companies may face difficulties in the near term, but well-established players still are likely to excel over the long run. And those well positioned in the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) market make a great addition to any tech portfolio -- especially at today's bargain prices. Let's check out three no-brainer AI stocks to buy before earnings season gets rolling. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA-3.01%)faces its share of challenges right now -- from a recenthalt on chip exportsto China to the possibility of import tariffs in the near future. The company makes most of its top-selling AI chips in Taiwan, throughTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. But it's important to remember the bright side of this picture. The company has become the global leader in AI, offering the highest-performance chip around as well as a complete range of supporting products and services. This means customers can turn to Nvidia for pretty much all of their AI needs -- and work with the most advanced technology on the market. AI has the potential to revolutionize businesses, helping them to become more and more efficient, and it's unlikely customers will give up on this. In fact, any economic slowdown might even push them to accelerate their AI plans to streamline their operations and lower costs. All of this, Nvidia's long track record of explosive earnings growth, and the company's valuation -- today trading at only 22 timesforward earnings estimates-- make it a fantastic buy right now. Amazon(AMZN-1.01%)is another player that's likely to score a big AI win. The company already uses AI to gain in efficiency across its fulfillment network, and this may be particularly important in any potential economic slowdown. And Amazon also is a seller of AI through its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS, as the world's No. 1 cloud provider, already has a huge customer base thanks to this leadership position -- and as these customers aim to build AI guess where they're likely to turn? To AWS. That's been happening because just last year AWS posted a $115 billion annual revenue run rate and has credited AI for its growth. The cloud business offers everything from chips to a fully managed platform allowing users to tailor large language models (LLMs) to their needs. And, like Nvidia, Amazon has delivered earnings growth over time, making it a solid, well-established operation. That's why it's definitely a buy today while trading at 27 times forward earnings estimates. You probably think ofMeta Platforms(META-0.22%)as a social media company, since it's the owner of the most popular such apps -- from Facebook and Messenger to WhatsApp and Instagram. And you're right. This is Meta's main, revenue-driving business, as the company generates most of its revenue through advertisements across these apps. But AI is starting to become a bigger and bigger part of the picture. For example, Meta created Meta AI, available on its apps, and it's already become the world's most-used AI assistant. The idea is, thanks to Meta AI, you'll spend more time on the apps, and as a result, advertisers will spend more money to reach you there. Meta isn't stopping at just that, though, and aims to become a leader in the broader AI market. It's on the right track, with its development of the Llama LLM and heavy investment in AI. The company says it may invest as much as $65 billion in the technology this year alone. Meta has increased earnings over time, is a clear leader in social media, and has big AI ambitions -- on top of that, the stock looks dirt cheap trading at 20 times forward earnings estimates. All of this makes it a no-brainer stock to buy asearnings seasonheats up -- and one to hold onto well into the future.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/21/3-no-brainer-ai-stocks-to-buy-before-earnings/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=5c85cf17-0aa4-4788-b5a6-9edf2cf7e788&.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-21 09:48:00,"Nvidia Is the Second Cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Right Now Based on 1 Key Valuation Metric. Is It a No-Brainer Buy?","For a long time, the last description most people would use to describeNvidia(NVDA-3.01%)was ""cheap."" Some still wouldn't describe the stock with that term. For example, NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran, known as the ""Dean of Valuation,"" thinks Nvidia remains overvalued by roughly 23%. However, Nvidia is the second-cheapest""Magnificent Seven"" stockright now based on one key valuation metric. Is the stock a no-brainer buy? Image source: Getty Images. If we only considered Nvidia's trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 35.5, the stock would seem quite expensive. The chipmaker's trailing P/E multiple is the second-highest in the Magnificent Seven, trailing onlyTeslawith a sky-high P/E ratio of 118.4. Looking to earnings over the next year makes Nvidia's valuation much more palatable. Its shares trade at roughly 23.3 times forward earnings. Within the Magnificent Seven, only Google parentAlphabetand Facebook parentMeta Platformshave lower forward earnings multiples. But peering even further into the future makes Nvidia appear even more attractive. The stock'sprice-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which is based on analysts' earnings growth projections over the next five years, is a low 1.02. Nvidia is running neck-and-neck with Meta for the lowest PEG ratio. Meta's PEG ratio is only a hair lower at 1.01. The obvious reason why Nvidia's PEG ratio is so low is that the stock has fallen sharply. Nvidia's share price is now down more than 30% below its previous high set early in 2025. This steep decline is due to several factors. In January, Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company DeepSeek's introduction of a powerfullarge language model (LLM)developed at a low cost raised concerns about the future demand for Nvidia's expensiveGPUs. President Trump's tariffs caused a major sell-off of stocks, with tech stocks such as Nvidia getting shellacked. Most recently, U.S. restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China resulted in the company taking a hit of $5.5 billion. But a lower share price is only one factor behind Nvidia's low PEG ratio. The other key ingredient is strong earnings growth expectations. Despite worries about increased competition and the Trump administration's trade policies, many Wall Street analysts still think Nvidia will continue to deliver exceptional earnings growth. Nvidia's largest customers, including several of its Magnificent Seven peers, remain committed to investing heavily in AI. Nvidia's GPUs are still the most powerful chips for powering AI models, especially with the launch of its new Blackwell platform. While AI is Nvidia's primary growth driver, it isn't the only one. CEO Jensen Huang believes that the shift from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing presents a $1 trillion opportunity for his company. With Nvidia nearly tied for the lowest PEG ratio among the Magnificent Seven stocks, is it a no-brainer buy? I wouldn't go that far. It's hard to say that no thinking is required to buy a stock when a prominent valuation expert such as Damodaran believes the stock can go significantly lower. Wall Street's five-year earnings growth projections could prove to be overly optimistic. The uncertainty and fears of a recession created by the Trump administration's tariffs also raise legitimate concerns about investing in Nvidia right now. That said, a stock can be a good pick even if it's not a no-brainer pick. I think Nvidia falls into this category. My view is that AI adoption isn't going to taper off. Although other companies will develop competitive AI chips, I don't expect them to overtake Nvidia's GPUs anytime soon. Nvidia will also almost certainly continue to roll out even more powerful GPUs. If you're a long-term investor, I think Nvidia's sell-off presents an excellent buying opportunity. This AI company just might be the most magnificent choice among the Magnificent Seven right now.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/21/nvidia-cheapest-magnificent-seven-stock-buy/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=74fb19c9-e315-4d72-80ee-698ffcd10d7e&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-21 11:00:00,Intel's New CEO Will Make His Earnings Debut This Week,"Lip-Bu Tan, the microphone is yours. Tan,named CEO of chipmaker Intel(INTC) in mid-March, hasn‚Äôt been invisible since his appointment. He gave the keynote address at a company event later that month, coming onstage in sneakers and a suit, sans necktie, and admitting in a speech that ‚Äúthere are areas we have fallen short of your expectations.‚Äù Still, Thursday afternoon will be the first quarterly earnings report and conference call under his leadership. Investors‚Äîwho bid the stock up after he was named, but have seen the shares give all those gains back and more‚Äîare eager to learn what might be next.(A rough 2024for the company and its stock contributed tothe December retirementof the former chief, Pat Gelsinger.) That will put the focus on Tan's next steps. Investors have been broadly excited about the possibility of deals for Intel‚Äîa while ago, there were even rumblings regarding a possible saleof the company itself‚Äîbut there has been comparatively little smoke on that front in recent weeks. Still, there has been news to digest. The company recently said it wouldsell a 51% stakein its Altera programmable chips unit to tech-focused private equity firm Silver Lake. And reports have described a possiblechipmaking joint venturewith Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), though TSMC threw some cold water on the idea last week. ""TSMC¬†is¬†not¬†engaged¬†in¬†any¬†discussion¬†with other companies regarding any joint venture, technology licensing or technology transfer and sharing,"" CEO C.C. Wei said on a conference call, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. For the most recently completed quarter, Wall Street analysts expect Intel to report revenue of $12.3 billion and adjusted net income of $41.6 million, according to the mean compiled by Visible Alpha. Wall Street may re-rate the stock after Thursday‚Äôs report, but for now the watchword seems to be caution. All the analysts following the company and tracked by Visible Alpha have neutral ratings, though their mean target just under $23 represents a roughly 20% premium to last week's finish near $19.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/intel-new-ceo-will-make-his-earnings-debut-this-week-11717921,3

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) NAPCO failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold (""COGS"") and inventory; (2) NAPCO downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) NAPCO‚Äôs unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included ‚Äúcertain errors‚Äù such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, NAPCO would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants‚Äô statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

2025-04-21 12:24:10,Forbes Recession Tracker: Apollo Says 90% Chance Of ‚ÄòVoluntary‚Äô Recession Heavily Impacting Small Businesses,"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline Fears of a sharp economic downturn due to President Donald Trump‚Äôs ever-changing tariff policies are pervading Wall Street, as some of the most trusted observers of the economy say the U.S. is far from able to declare victory on a tariff-driven recession, and the top economist at one of the world‚Äôs largest asset managers says there are overwhelming odds Trump‚Äôs trade war will sink the U.S. into a recession. US President Donald Trump flanked by his two top economic officials earlier this month in Treasury ... More Secretary Scott Bessent, center, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, right.AFP via Getty Images  Key Facts   Torsten Slok, the chief economist at asset management titan Apollo Global Management, wrote this weekend he believes there‚Äôs a 90% probability the U.S. will fall into a ‚ÄúVoluntary Trade Reset Recession,‚Äù slamming Trump‚Äôs trade policies for being ‚Äúimplemented in a way that has not been effective‚Äù after his ‚Äúadministration inherited an economy with strong growth.‚Äù    Small businesses will be ‚Äúparticularly‚Äù hard hit as they ‚Äúdo not have the working capital to pay tariffs,‚Äù Slok added, predicting ‚Äúwell-run generational retailers‚Äù will go bankrupt if tariffs stay at the current levels.    Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said last Tuesday his bank‚Äôs baseline economic forecast does not call for a recession this year, but other big banks‚Äô economic models still indicate the chance of a recession this year remains a tossup: Morgan Stanley forecasts 40% odds, Goldman Sachs places 45% likelihood of a recession over the next year and JPMorgan Chase projects a 60% chance.    National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business' on Monday he is ‚Äú100% not‚Äù expecting a recession in 2025, explaining recent discussions with CEOs indicated the ‚Äúuncertainty over tariffs‚Äù won‚Äôt be ‚Äúa big drag‚Äù on the economy.   Though the Trump administration‚Äôs backdown early this month from its most aggressive tariffs alleviated concerns the U.S. was on the cusp of a recession, Hassett‚Äôs confidence is far from a consensus view among Wall Street bigwigs and prominent economists.   Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said in a last Sunday interview with NBC News: ‚ÄúRight now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession, and I‚Äôm worried about something worse than a recession if this isn‚Äôt handled well.‚Äù   Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary during President Bill Clinton‚Äôs term, said in a last Monday editorial podcast in The New York Times he believes it‚Äôs ‚Äúsix in 10 or better that a recession will start this year,‚Äù explaining: ‚ÄúThe pause is certainly better than if we had simply charged along on the catastrophic path that we‚Äôre on, but anybody who thinks the genie is back in the bottle and that it‚Äôs all now OK should reconsider their position.‚Äù   Last week, Summers predicted such a downturn would leave an additional 2 million Americans unemployed, a more than 28% increase from the 7.1 million unemployed Americans in March, and a $5,000 or greater decline in annual household income.   Moody's Analytics Mark Zandi said last Monday on ‚ÄúCNN News Central‚Äù he sees the U.S. sinking into a recession over the next ‚Äúthree, four‚Äù weeks if the policy uncertainty is still ‚Äúvery thick,‚Äù saying he hopes ‚Äúthe president and the administration kind of finds an off ramp here and the trade war de-escalates.‚Äù   Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the United Nations agency IMF, said last Thursday the fund made ‚Äúnotable markdowns‚Äù to its global economic growth forecasts due to trade disruptions, though it still does not predict a recession, while warning the ‚Äúhigh uncertainty raises the risk of financial market stress.‚Äù     Bank Of America Survey Finds Investors‚Äô Economic Growth Expectations At 3-Decade Low Some 42% of big money managers now expect as of April‚Äîthe fourth-highest monthly reading of the last two decades for Bank of America‚Äôs April fund manager survey, which also found the 82% of respondents expect weaker global economic growth, the highest reading in 30 years. The closely watched poll was conducted among 195 managers of an aggregate $444 billion assets under management April 4-10, the week after Trump announced his country-by-country tariffs. Crucial Quote ‚ÄúThe prospect of a recession has increased,‚Äù Goldman CEO David Solomon said in an earnings call last week. ‚ÄúOur clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors are concerned by the significant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions,‚Äù continued Solomon.  News Peg Corporate earnings season is underway, which should better reveal the health of the economy during the first three months of 2025. United Airlines took a rarely seen step this week of issuing a pair of profit forecasts, one in the case of a recession, and one in the case of more stable growth. ‚ÄúA single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the Company‚Äôs expectation has become bimodal ‚Äì either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession,‚Äù the company wrote in a regulatory filing. Gold And Oil Prices Hint At Potential Global Slowdowngold And Oil Prices Hint At Potential Global Slowdown Trading in two of the world‚Äôs most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 20% this year to a record $3,400 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. ‚ÄúAlong with simmering geopolitical tensions, gold is benefiting from worries that higher tariffs will kindle inflation,‚Äù Solita Marcelli, UBS Global Wealth Management‚Äôs chief investment officer Americas, wrote in a recent note to clients, setting a $3,500 per troy ounce price target for the precious metal. Jamie Dimon‚Äôs Recession Warnings Influenced Trump‚Äôs Pause In an interview just hours before Trump paused many of the more than 10% country-by-country levies, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told ‚ÄúMornings With Maria‚Äù he believed a tariff-spurred recession is ‚Äúprobably‚Äù a ‚Äúlikely outcome,‚Äù adding he‚Äôs heard ‚Äúrecessionary talk‚Äù in conversations with other business leaders. Trump said the comments from Dimon, the head of the nation‚Äôs largest bank by assets and market value, partially inspired his pause. Economists at JPMorgan had labeled Trump‚Äôs policies as the ‚Äúlargest tax increase‚Äù since 1968 which will ‚Äúfall heavily on the US consumer.‚Äù In JPMorgan‚Äôs earnings call, Dimon repeated his pushback against Trump‚Äôs targeting of allies in his trade war, explaining the ‚Äúmost important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically.‚Äù Stock Market Signals Slowdown Fears Stock prices don‚Äôt completely correlate with economic growth, but equity investors are clearly pricing still in significantly increased odds of a down stretch for the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 briefly dove into a 20% bear market last week, wiping out about $10 trillion in market value, led by stocks considered the most vulnerable to a slowdown, including artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla. But markets are still pricing ‚Äúnowhere close to the worst case‚Äù scenario, Bhanu Baweja, UBS Investment Bank‚Äôs chief strategist, said. Even after the post-pause recovery, the S&P is still down 14% from its February peak.  Trump Administration Prepared Americans For The Possibility Of A Recession Ahead of the ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù announcement last week, Trump braced Americans for a possible recession. In a Fox News interview aired March 9, he would not rule out the possibility of a recession, cautioning Americans for a period of economic ‚Äútransition‚Äù as his policies take hold and noting he‚Äôs paying little attention to stock market losses. In subsequent media appearances, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent similarly declined to dismiss a potential recession and said the U.S. will go through a ‚Äúdetox period.‚Äù Bessent told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù in an interview he believes it ‚Äúwould have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes‚Äù on ahead of the Great Recession. ‚ÄúBe Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!,‚Äù Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. What Needs To Happen To Gdp To Trigger A Recession (it‚Äôs Not Negative‚Äîyet) The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, a comprehensive measure of all goods and services produced in a country. The official quarterly GDP stats haven't turned negative yet, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve's real-time model ignited concerns by calling for -1.8% annual GDP growth in 2025's first quarter, which would be the worst reading since 2020‚Äîthough the estimate is likely skewed by its methodology, including how it accounts for a surge in gold imports. Bond Market Is Shaky‚Äîbut Yield Curve‚Äôs Still Intact Elsewhere in financial markets, a flight to government-issued debt is evidence of a thirst for safer returns in the face of a potential recession, as yields for benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds have dropped by 40 basis points over the past three months (lower yields mean bonds got more valuable). But the most common bond market signal of a recession, the inversion of the yield curve, in which longer-term bonds have lower yields than shorter-dated ones, has actually normalized in recent months. The New York Fed‚Äôs bond-linked recession model calls for just 30% recession odds over the next year, down from the more than 70% odds in late 2023, a period which failed to materialize into a full-blown recession. Consumer Confidence Signals Americans Bracing For Tough Times Perhaps the most concerning signal over the last is a breakdown in everyday Americans‚Äô conviction in the economy, as the Conference Board‚Äôs closely watched consumer confidence survey tumbled this month to its lowest level since 2021. That tracks with weaker spending, as February retail sales grew by just 0.2% from January to February, according to a report released March 17 by the Census Bureau, far worse than the 0.6% month-over-month increase projected by economists. Unemployment Rate Is Still Fine One of the most important hallmarks of the American economy, the labor market has shown some cracks in early 2025 as job creation slowed and layoffs spiked, but remains overwhelmingly strong, as March‚Äôs 4.2% unemployment rate sits well within the healthy historic norm. A key labor market recession indicator, the Sahm rule, flashes a far lower likelihood of a recession than it did when it peaked last summer, inspiring a short-lived market selloff in August. What To Watch For Trading in two of the world‚Äôs most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 10% this year to a record $3,200 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. What To Watch For Bessent and Trump have made clear they are lasered in on lowering interest rates, which are determined by the politically independent Fed. Typically, rates are only drastically cut during periods of economic distress, as lower rates typically stimulate economic growth as households and businesses are more likely to borrow with lower interest costs, though that uptick in loan activity can simultaneously lead to higher inflation as demand rises. The Fed is likely to hold off on further rate cuts ‚Äúuntil tariff policy becomes clearer,‚Äù according to David Mericle, Goldman‚Äôs chief U.S. economist.

According to reports, Huang met with several government officials, including Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, as well as Liang Wenfeng, founder of Chinese AI research firmDeepSeek, which stunned the tech world earlier this year when it said it produced an AI product at a much lower cost than traditional models. Also last week, Nvidia reported in a regulatory filing that it was advised by U.S. officials that it would need a license to export its key H20 AI chips to China, and that requirement could result inup to $5.5 billioninchargesin the first quarter. Shares of Nvidia fell nearly 4% soon after markets opened Monday. They have lost more than a quarter of their value this year.

Office 365 and Azure are the crown jewels - software so embedded in global business that replacing them would require re-training, new security protocols, and millions in switching costs. 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Azure and a very large chunk of it uses Microsoft productivity tools. Recurring revenue (subscriptions) is how Microsoft primarily earnings money. Add to that pricing power and you have a textbook compounding case.  The Numbers?

And that matters.  With less than 5% of revenue exposed to Chinese customers, Microsoft is insulated from trade wars. Its cloud and software products are digital exports, which aren‚Äôt subject to physical tariffs. Sure it may slowdown its AI rollout as importing parts to build data centers gets more expensive. When tensions rise, Microsoft doesn‚Äôt sweat. It invoices in USD, hosts in the cloud, and sells licenses, not parts.  In a de-globalizing world, Microsoft‚Äôs geopolitical footprint is a superpower.  What Happens When The Trade Rotates? Right now, Nvidia and Meta have stolen the spotlight. But valuations are stretched, and institutional funds know rotation is coming.    If even 10% of funds invested in Mag 7 rebalance toward Microsoft, that‚Äôs hundreds of billions in buying pressure With earnings stability and balance sheet strength, Microsoft is the natural safe-haven.

Also struggling Monday were bonds, as yields for longer-dated U.S. bonds spiked, signaling reluctance to hold government debt (higher yields mean less valuable bonds).    Yields for the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose eight basis points to 4.4%, the highest level since last Monday, while yields for 30-year bonds climbed 10 basis points to more than 4.9%, also the highest level since last Monday.    The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) fell 1% to 98, putting the dollar at its weakest level compared to other major currencies since March 2022, with the latest dollar deterioration coming as Trump intensifies his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.   Trump‚Äôs flirtation with firing Powell should be ‚Äútaken very seriously and very negatively,‚Äù said Win Thin, global head of markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., according to Bloomberg.   Trump called Powell a ‚Äúmajor loser‚Äù in a Monday morning post to the president‚Äôs Truth Social site, again demanding interest rate cuts as he tests the limits of the Fed‚Äôs historic operational independence from the Oval Office.     Chief Critic Trump‚Äôs toying with ousting Powell stands on shaky legal footing and, as a potential historic first, it is far from unanimously supported amongst Republican leaders. ‚ÄúI don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman,‚Äù Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet The Press‚Äù on Sunday, continuing: ‚ÄúI think the Federal Reserve ought to be independent. I think that Jay Powell and President Trump need to sit down and, once again, have a hug and a cup of hot cocoa and work it out.‚Äù Crucial Quote ‚ÄúThe open question is how to accurately quantify the effect on asset class prices before the dust settles and the extent of tariffs levied against trading partners is actually established,‚Äù Oppenheimer‚Äôs chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus wrote in a Monday note to clients.  Apple, Nvidia And Tesla Lead Big Tech Slide Shares of all seven ‚Äúmagnificent seven‚Äù big technology stocks ‚Äì Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla ‚Äì were in the red Monday as the group continues to be crushed by the tariff selloff. Apple and Nvidia stocks fell 2% and 5%, respectively, as both companies with heavy China exposure grappled with worrisome reports about market share in the Asian country. Shares of Tesla slid 6% as Elon Musk‚Äôs electric vehicle maker prepares to report first-quarter earnings Tuesday afternoon. Consensus analyst forecasts call for Tesla to disclose its worst quarterly profit since 2021‚Äôs first quarter, according to FactSet. But Gold And Bitcoin Surge Monday was a strong day for the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency bitcoin and the world‚Äôs top safe haven gold as investors searched for places to park their capital as the dollar, U.S. stocks and U.S. bonds simultaneously tanked. Gold prices rose more than 3% on Monday to a record of more than $3,430 per troy ounce, extending its year-to-date gain to more than 25%, while bitcoin prices rose 4% in the 24-hour period ending at 9:45 a.m. to nearly $88,000, the digital asset‚Äôs top level since March.

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slid as low as 97.92, its lowest level since March 2022, early Monday morning. The benchmark dollar index has declined about 5% since early April when President Trump shook global financial markets with his unveiling of sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Wall Street on Monday was focused on Trump's relationship with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom the president has accused of slow-walking interest rate cuts. Trump on Thursdaysaidthe Fed Chair's ""termination can't come fast enough.""White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett on Friday told reporters the president was looking into whether they could oust Powell, whom Trump first appointed to the position in 2018. The fight over the Fed‚Äôs independence is just the latest development in Washington to spook investors. Stockssold off, Treasury yields soared, and the dollar slumped in the weeks after Trump unveiled his ""reciprocal tariffs"" aimed at nearly every country in the world. Market watchers noted with concern that turmoil in the stock market should have sent investors flocking to traditional safe havens like Treasurys and the dollar. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellenrecently saidthe pattern suggested ""investors are beginning to shun dollar-based assets."" Investors have rushed into one safe haven: gold, which hasrisen nearly 30%so far this year and climbed to a fresh all-time high of more than $3,440 an ounce on Monday. Long-term Treasury yields were moderately higher early afternoon Monday. The 10-year Treasury note, which affects interest rates on various consumer and commercial loans, recently yielded 4.39%, off its high of 4.42% earlier in the day but up from 4.33% at the prior session's close. Trump's fight with Powell could have far-reaching implications for the global economy. ""Arguably, the great moderation of inflation was driven by a trend toward central bank independence,"" wrote Paul Donovan, Chief Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, on Monday. ""While monetary policy is a relatively blunt weapon, it can be wielded to control medium-term inflation. This depends on trust in the central bank. Building that trust takes years. Losing that trust can happen overnight.""

A week ago, a¬†Microsoft¬†executive said the software company was¬†slowing down¬†or temporarily holding off on advancing early build-outs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are the leading providers of cloud infrastructure, and both have ramped up their capital expenditures in recent quarters to meet the demands of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

‚ÄúOver the weekend, we heard from several industry sources that AWS has paused a portion of its leasing discussions on the colocation side (particularly international ones),‚Äù Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note. They added that ‚Äúthe positioning is similar to what we‚Äôve heard recently from MSFT,‚Äù in that both companies are reeling in some new projects but not canceling signed deals.

Tech stocks have been pressured across the board his year as¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs¬†proposals for widespread tariffs raised the prospect for dramatically higher costs on imports of equipment while also threatening to slow the economy. Cloud infrastructure providers have been aggressively announcing plans to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars securing¬†Nvidia‚Äôs¬†graphics processing units (GPUs) and building new data centers.

That was before the announcement on tariffs earlier this month. Microsoft and Amazon both report quarterly results next week. Their stock prices were down on Monday brining Amazon‚Äôs decline for the year to 25% and Microsoft‚Äôs drop to 15%.

An AWS spokesperson didn‚Äôt immediately provide a comment. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC‚Äôs Andrew Ross Sorkin that he did not see the company cutting down on data center construction.

2025-04-21 19:48:27,The One Trait Warren Buffett's Mentor Says Almost Always Leads Investors to Financial Disaster,"A crucial lesson from Benjamin Graham‚Äîthe legendary investor who was a dear mentor toWarren Buffett‚Äîinvolves how different investing is from the other things we do: The very trait that drives success in most areas of life can destroy your financial future. ""While enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster,"" Graham warned in his classic book, ""Security Analysis: Principles and Technique.""This counterintuitive insight from the man who shapedBuffett's investment philosophyexplains why even brilliant investors often fall prey to market bubbles and emotional decision-making. In his ""The Intelligent Investor,"" Graham wrote that Wall Street transforms enthusiasm into a liability even though it fosters success in other fields. Market enthusiasm, he argues, functions like ""an artificial stimulant"" that makes investments seem more attractive, as outsized valuations might be validated by other investors and the fear of missing out (FOMO).When investors see others profiting from trending investments, rational analysis is often pushed aside byfear, greed, and, yes, enthusiasm. This psychological vulnerability affects nearly everyone. As markets rise, enthusiasm creates a self-reinforcing cycle: price increases supposedly confirm existing enthusiasm, drawing more participants, further driving prices upward as herding behavior takes hold‚Äîuntil the inevitable collapse. Research inbehavioral financeshows that during these periods, investors systematically overestimate their ability to sell off without losing too much while underestimating their risks. Graham noted that even brilliant minds‚Äîhe references Isaac Newton, who lost a fortune in theSouth Sea Bubble‚Äîcan fall prey toirrational exuberance. Sticking to preset investment rules and entertaining contrarian views can help you avoid enthusiasm-driven mistakes. Central to Graham's work was his claim that enthusiasm causes investors to lose sight of what's most important to him and Buffett: the actual value of a stock. As thebulls runon the stock market, conversations shift from fundamentals.Price-to-earnings ratiosmay soar, say, from 15 to 50 or more, as overenthusiastic investors justify these valuations with tales about exponential growth or revolutionary business models. When pressed on valuations, enthusiastic investors often respond with some version of ""this time is different"" or ""traditional metrics don't apply here."" Investors stop being analysts and become trend followers, often with disastrous consequences when fundamentals do reassert themselves. Echoing Graham, Buffett once told Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (BRK.A) shareholders about the perils of moments: ""The line separatinginvestment and speculation, which is never bright and clear, becomes blurred still further when most market participants have recently enjoyed triumphs. Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money."" Here are some safeguards that can help during market run-ups: ""The market is not a weighing machine"" where price tells you exactly the value of something, Graham wrote. ""Rather, should we say that the market is a voting machine,"" reflecting a mix of reason and emotion.Indeed, few saw the dot-com or housingbubbles bursting‚Äîuntil they did. For both Buffett and Graham, what's central to successful investing isn't a superior intelligence but the ability to resist the enthusiasm that's so often destructive of portfolios.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/trait-that-leads-to-financial-disaster-11712570,3
2025-04-21 19:56:46,Nvidia Faces $5.5B Blow as Tech Sector Urged to Brace for Tariff Fallout,"As the U.S.China tariff battle intensifies, Wedbush analysts say companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the broader tech sector urgently need clarity and a defined negotiation strategy. In a client note, analyst Daniel Ives said the back-and-forth tariff shifts under former President Trump have likely pushed the economy closer to recession. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to Ives, uncertainty from stalled capital expenditures, frozen hiring, and supply chain disruptions has created economic conditions reminiscent of the COVID era only this time, driven by policy. Nvidia's disclosure last week that its H20 chips are now subject to U.S. export restrictions added another layer of strain. The company could take a $5.5 billion hit as a result, contributing to a more than 5% drop in shares during early Monday trading. Wedbush remains optimistic on the long-term tech outlook, especially around artificial intelligence, but expects near-term volatility. The firm estimates a roughly 10% cut to 2025 earnings expectations across tech, with the June quarter seen as a reset. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who recently traveled to China for meetings, emphasized the market's importance and expressed hope for ongoing cooperation. Still, Wedbush believes Washington is unlikely to allow high-end chips to reach China during this strategic standoff.

2025-04-21 20:08:14,"Retreating From Its Surge, Mortgage Rates Roller Coaster Ends the Week With Positive News","Already have a mortgage and looking for refi rates? We cover refinancing every business day, including thenational average refi ratefor all major loan types, as well asstate-by-state refi averages. The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Mortgage rates have not been spared from the market chaos triggered by President Trump's on-again, off-againtariffannouncements. Though an initial stock market sell-off prompted a drop in 10-year Treasury yields, which in turn pushed mortgage rates lower, that trend reversed after just two days. Bond yields then soared,confounding many experts‚Äîand unsurprisingly shooting mortgage rates higher. But the roller coaster continues, as the 30-year mortgage rate average changed direction again last week. You can see the latest one-week change for each new purchase loan average below, followed by a deeper dive into 30-year, 15-year, and jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loans. Rates on 30-year new purchase loans dropped 20 basis points across the first three days last week, before creeping up a minimal 2 basis points over Thursday and Friday. That brings the flagship average to 6.96%‚Äîa notable improvement vs. the 7.14% average of the previous Friday. During that prior week, 30-year rates shot up a remarkable 44 basis points, for their biggest Friday-to-Friday gain since June 2022 and their most expensive average in almost 11 months. Things were much better in September, when the 30-year average plunged to a two-year low of 5.89% (the cheapest Friday average being 6.03%). So far this year, the lowest weekly reading has been 6.55%. Every business day, we publishnational rate averages for various loan types, and alsoeach state's 30-year rate average. Right now, New York and Florida have the lowest 30-year rates. Rates on 15-year new purchase loansalso declined last week, subtracting a bold 20 basis points to average 6.11%‚Äîcompared to 6.31% a week earlier.Still, the current reading is almost 1.15 percentage points above the two-year low of 4.97% registered in September. Rates on jumbo 30-year new purchase loans fell 14 basis points last week, landing Friday at a 7.01% average. That's compared to a 2025 high of 7.15%. In contrast, September rates on new 30-year jumbo loans sank as far as 6.24%, with the lowest weekly average registering at 6.39%. Ajumbo mortgageis one that exceeds the maximum loan limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming loans‚Äî$806,500 for single-family homes in most parts of the U.S. in 2025, but up to $1,209,750 in certain more expensive areas. To see how much this week's rate increases would impact monthly payments for new borrowers, our tables below lay out theprincipal-plus-interest paymentfor various loan amounts with a 30-year, 15-year, or jumbo 30-year fixed-rate new purchase mortgage. By definition, jumbo 30-year mortgages are larger loans. So below we've run our calculations on loan amounts of $800,000 to $1.2 million.

2025-04-21 20:20:50,Nvidia CEO Visits China as New U.S. Export Curbs Hit $5.5 Billion in Orders,"Nvidia (NVDA,Financials) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huangtraveled to China last week, looking to steady the company's ties in the region as new U.S. export rules threaten billions in sales. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. Huang met senior officials including Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and said Nvidia hoped to continue to cooperate with China, according to Chinese state media. He also met Shanghai's mayor and visited Liang Wenfeng, founder of AI company DeepSeek. The visit came just as the U.S. Commerce Department tightened export controls, requiring licenses for Nvidia to sell its H20 AI chips to China. The department cited national and economic security concerns and said the rules would apply indefinitely. Nvidia expects to lose about $5.5 billion in orders from Chinese tech giants like Tencent (TCEHY,Financials), Alibaba (BABA,Financials), and ByteDance. No grace period was offered to fulfill pending shipments. The H20 chip was originally designed to comply with earlier restrictions. But DeepSeek's recent success in developing generative AI using less powerful hardware renewed U.S. fears about China's tech progress. Analysts said the new limits could push China to speed up efforts to build better AI chips through firms like Huawei, though domestic options still lag behind Nvidia's. The move highlights a wider split in global technology between U.S. and China-based systems. In response, Nvidia plans to invest up to $500 billion in AI servers in the United States, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM,Financials) is expanding chip production in Arizona with a $100 billion investment.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down more than 2.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) sank 2.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped almost 2.4%, or nearly 1,000 points. AsYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer notes, the stock market remains largely at the mercy of Trump's tariffs. Different headlines and shifts in narratives have driven big market swings over the past several weeks, with all three indexes down sinceTrump's ""Liberation Day""event. Meanwhile, investors are grappling with a growing concern: Trump'sbluster around removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for allegedly keeping interest rates too high, with his latest insult posted on Monday morning, warning that the economy could slow ""unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped more than 900 points while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell more than 2.5% as high-growth tech stocks sold off.

Oil prices dropped as much as 3% on Monday as nuclear talks between Iran and the US progressed, easing supply worries. A broader market sell-off amid a US-China trade war also weighed on prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the US benchmark, hovered near $63 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, sat just below $66 a barrel. Futures sank after the US and Iranheld ""constructive"" talksover the weekend about Tehran's nuclear program.

Stocks opened lower but sank further after President Trump hurled another public insult at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, warning of a ""SLOWING"" of the economy ""unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW."" Hertz (HTZ) shares tumbled 11% Monday morning, giving back gains from last week‚Äôs rally sparked by Bill Ackman‚Äôs hedge fund taking a significant position in the rental car giant. Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, shared onsocial mediathat his company had built a 19.8% stake in Hertz after accumulating shares since late last year. Hertz stock surged on Wednesday after Pershing Square disclosed its 12.7 million share stake, fueling investor speculation about the high-profile fund's view of the struggling company. The rental company reported a loss of nearly $2.9 billion in 2024. Hertz attributed the disappointing results to vehicle depreciation and the drop in the price of electric vehicles, which it began purchasing back in 2021 to stay competitive with the industry. Ackman sees the company benefiting from auto tariffs, which will likely raise used car prices in the near term. Other automakers, like Audi and Volkswagen (VWAGY), have pledged to halt imports to avoid paying the 25% levies. According to Ackman, that would be a boon for Hertz, which owns a fleet of more than 500,000 cars valued at roughly $12 billion. A 10% increase in used car prices could translate to a $1.2 billion boost in the company‚Äôs auto assets alone. Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta (META) were leading the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks lower on Monday amid an overall market sell-off. EV maker Tesla dropped 4% ahead of its quarterly results due on Tuesday. Chip giant Nvidia dropped aftera report from Reuterssaid Chinese tech giant Huawei is set to begin shipping advanced AI chips as soon as next month. The move comes after President Trump's new export rules effectively banned Nvidia from selling its H20 chips in China.

Last week, reports swirled that Trump has beenpursuing possibly firing Fed Chair Jerome Powellafter Trump told reporters, ""If I want him out, he‚Äôll be out of there real fast, believe me."" But investors have largely argued this wouldn't be a welcome a sign for markets, with even the possibility of Trump ousting Powell could be another headwind for stocks. ""If the independence of the Fed ... comes into question and is actually realized, I think that would further put downward pressure on the confidence that foreign investors have in investing in US dollar assets,"" Michael Goosay, Principal Asset Management's chief investment officer of global fixed income, told Yahoo Finance. If you're planning a trip abroad this summer, the weak US dollar could put a dent in your travel budget. On Monday, the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) extended its decline, hitting its lowest point in three years against key global currencies. It's one of the worst starts to a year for the greenback in decades. That means American travelers will have less spending power while on grand tours of European capitals this summer. But a weak US dollar isn't all bad news. While travelers may feel the pinch, there's a silver lining for US businesses. Profits made overseas in euros, pounds, and yen are worth more when converted back into dollars, offering a financial boost for companies with international profits. As my colleague Ines Ferr√© noted below, the ""sell America"" theme is alive and well in markets amid heightened trade tensions and President Trump's heavy criticism of Fed Chair Powell.

2025-04-21 21:05:33,What Huawei's reported chip production boost means for Nvidia,"Nvidia (NVDA) stock is falling as investors weigh Huawei'sreported artificial intelligence (AI) chip plans. Bernstein managing director and senior analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Market Domination to discuss the situation, noting that it may not be consequential for Nvidia. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. We got these reports China's Huawei planning a new AI chip. They say for mass shipment. It's from Reuters. Looking at Nvidia, they're down about 6% in today's trade. Stacey, you cover the name. What do you make of that headline? To be honest, I don't see why it matters. Nvidia's not allowed to sell anything in China anymore, as it relates to AI. So who cares? I mean, to be honest, this is my issue with the ban that we got last week on Nvidia's China offerings and they've already been heavily constrained by export controls. The part that they were allowed to sell in China, it was called H20. The performance was already very limited. And the parts that Huawei had available actually are, they have better performance. They're missing some other things, software compatibility, but they have better performance. After last week, and then the government is now requiring licenses, licenses for Nvidia, even to ship that low-end part. So effectively they can't ship any AI parts into China anymore. So to be honest, we've basically just handed the China AI market to Huawei anyways. So like I'm not surprised by any of this at all. And you know, at least from where we're standing now, I don't know that it matters. Like I said, they they they can't compete anyways. They're not allowed. I mean, so, okay, so let's assume Stacey that policies are not permanent, right? And that you get a change in administration in a few years and things change again. Does this give Huawei such a hard head start that even if the policy changes, you know, it'll give it a leg up. How you know, how are you thinking sort of longer term? Yes, and then you have to remember that the policies that were in place until last week were actually put there under the Biden administration, not under the Trump administration. And so, that low-end part that Nvidia was allowed to ship until last week was already well below, you know, Huawei's offerings and frankly, I doubt that those thresholds were ever going to get raised and so the gap between, you know, what Nvidia was allowed to ship and frankly, the local capabilities was going to get bigger and bigger over time anyways. So, no, I think we were going down this path as it stands. Nvidia has even talked about the China market getting more and more competitive and you can even look at their sales into China. They I think they did about 17 billion last year, was probably about 12 billion in AI sales. That was the largest on an absolute basis that they've ever shipped, but as a percentage of their total revenue, was the lowest in over 10 years. Right? So China increasingly was becoming less important to them. They were getting decoupled because of the nature of these policies that were put in place. And again, it wasn't really Trump until recently, this was the Biden administration.",News,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/huaweis-reported-chip-production-boost-200533446.html?.tsrc=rss,4

The FTC accused Uber of charging consumers for Uber One without their consent, not delivering promised savings, and making it difficult for users to stop paying for the service. Uber One, which costs $9.99 per month, includes 6% back on rides and $0 delivery fees on Uber Eats, among other perks.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the losses, down 2.6% at the closing bell, with the S&P 500 off 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 972 points, or 2.5%. The VIX jumped more than 12% as gold surged to a record $3,432 per ounce. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low, and stocks fell further after President Donald Trump again fiercely criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his pressure campaign on the central bank to cut interest rates. ‚Äú‚ÄòPreemptive Cuts‚Äô in Interest Rates are being called for by many,‚ÄùTrump said on his social media site Truth Social. ‚ÄúWith Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden‚Äôs egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other ‚Äòthings‚Äô trending down, there is virtually No Inflation. With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs latest salvo against Powell came days after hesaid the central bank chief‚Äôs ‚Äútermination cannot come fast enough.‚Äù The attacks havedeepened investor fears over the Fed‚Äôs independence and added to the broader sense of policy unpredictability driving market volatility. It‚Äôs no mystery: Long-term investors and operators alike know that trust and stability are core to functioning markets. When leadership injects chaos or undermines institutional credibility, the costs show up everywhere ‚Äî from higher borrowing rates to delayed investment decisions. Nvidia stock dropped 4.5% after new White House export restrictions on its AI chips appeared tohand a competitive edge to Chinese rivals such as Huawei, which reportedly plans to ship its own advanced chip to local customers as soon as next month.

Withmore than 100 companies reporting earnings this week‚Äî including Tesla, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Boeing (BA), and Procter & Gamble (PG) ‚Äî traders are looking for any signs of resilience, or at least clarity, as a chaotic second quarter kicks into gear. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was down after reports thatHuawei will begin mass shipments of a new AI chipto Chinese customers as soon as next month. The move highlights Beijing‚Äôs push to reduce reliance on U.S. technology ‚Äî and deepens investor anxiety aroundNvidia‚Äôs access to the massive Chinese marketafter the White House imposed additional rules on the company‚Äôs chip sales. It‚Äôs been a whiplash month for equities, with intraday swings as large as 5% and every major index well off its pre-‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äùlevels. The coming week may determine whether that trend deepens... or finally breaks. Earnings from tech giants, including Tesla and Google, will be scrutinized not just for growth but for signs of stability in a market that‚Äôs grown more erratic by the day. With so many companies reporting this week, the next few days could set the tone for the rest of the second quarter. ‚ÄúThe Street does not care anymore about words and ‚Äòdeal progress‚Äô comments,‚Äù Wedbush analysts said in a Sunday note. ‚ÄúThe economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.‚Äù The difference, Wedbush noted, is that this time the damage is ‚Äúself-inflicted,‚Äù concluding bluntly: ‚ÄúWe are heading into a tech earnings season that we expect minimal/no guidance as C-level executives are playing darts blindfolded with gauging the growth and spending plans of their customers.‚Äù One bright spot?

2025-04-21 21:43:08,Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Isn‚Äôt Cheap ‚ÄòUnless Everything Goes Right‚Äô,"We recently published a list of10 Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy and Sell Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about President Donald Trump‚Äôs attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and said he was expecting this to happen ‚Äúweeks ago.‚Äù Cramer said that he ‚Äúlikes‚Äù Powell and thinks the central bank chief is now in a difficult situation. Cramer thinks it‚Äôd be ‚Äúillegal‚Äù for Trump to fire Powell. ‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve never cuts rates when inflation‚Äôs out of control, which it very well could be once the tariffs are all in. I think the Fed chief wants to find out if that‚Äôs going to happen. I like Powell, you know that. I think he‚Äôs generally done a good job, a good public servant. Unfortunately, right now, he‚Äôs stuck between a rock and a hard place. Now, history says he should be doing exactly what he‚Äôs doing, but history is now in the eye of the beholder, and there‚Äôs only one beholder in this whole country, and it ain‚Äôt J. Powell.‚Äù Cramer said that tariffs will result in higher prices, and that will in turn make the central bank‚Äôs job difficult because it cannot cut rates when prices are going up. READ ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article, we picked 10 stocks Cramer was talking about in his recent programs. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jim Cramer said in a latest program on CNBC that investors were expecting a bump in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares when the GTC started, but the stock actually fell. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd expect some sort of impact on the stock market or at least in the stock of Nvidia but that sure didn‚Äôt happen today. We learn that nothing‚Äôs more powerful than multiple compression as Nvidia stock actually slid $410. It declined 3.4%. I say, ouch. Okay, I can see a bear case here although I don‚Äôt share. My charitable trust is a big position stock and Nvidia stock isn‚Äôt cheap unless everything goes right, and in this climate of fear environment, it‚Äôs hard to see everything go on right even for a company that is this special. And oh my, after watching today‚Äôs keynote, it always reminds you how special it really is. Just because 17,500 people get together to listen to Jensen Huang, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to get higher stock prices. Sometimes the tape is simply against you. End of story.‚Äù The market will keep punishing Nvidia for not coming up to its gigantic (and sometimes unrealistic) growth expectations. About 50% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from large cloud providers, which are rethinking their plans amid the DeepSeek launch and looking for low-cost chips. Nvidia‚Äôs Q1 guidance shows a 9.4% QoQ revenue growth, down from the previous 12% QoQ growth. Its adjusted margin is expected to be down substantially as well to 71%. The market does not like it when Nvidia fails to post a strong quarterly beat. The stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters when the company will report unimpressive growth. Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC‚Äôs 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia‚Äôs access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses¬† TSMC‚Äôs 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offer alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia‚Äôs offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter: ‚ÄúNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead the market for graphics processing units and semiconductor chips needed to power AI applications. Because our position in the stock is an underweight relative to the nearly 12% of the benchmark it now represents, it was a relative detractor for the year.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 1ston our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

2025-04-21 22:57:14,Trump's Criticism of Powell Is Shaking Markets' Faith In Fed's Independence,"Markets are sending a message to President Donald Trump: Don‚Äôt mess with the Federal Reserve. Investors fled U.S. assets again on Monday after Trump putmore pressure on the Fed to cutinterest rates‚Äîpotentially threatening its ability to act independently of the president‚Äôs desires. The latest Trump criticisms are making investors even less confident about the U.S. dollar and the country‚Äôs dominant role in global financial markets, analysts say. Markets had ‚Äúalready started to entertain notions ofde-dollarization‚Äù following Trump‚Äôs tariff policies, according to Themistoklis Fiotakis, a top strategist at the British bank Barclays. Trump is adding fuel to the fire, Fiotakis wrote, bringing about risks to the dollar that are ‚Äútoo large to ignore.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe notion of the Fed independence being at risk ‚Ä¶ is an event that carries very significant tail risks not only for the dollar, but also for the global financial system,‚Äù Fiotakis wrote in a note to clients. The concerns about Fed independence added to lingering concerns about the impact of tariffs on the economy, sparking avolatile session of trading on Monday. Major stock indexes fell more than 2%, U.S. Treasury securities sold off again, and thedollar hit its weakest level in three years. The sell-off followed a Truth Social post on Monday from Trump calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell a ‚Äúmajor loser‚Äù and saying thatlower inflation figures call for rate cuts‚ÄúNOW.‚Äù Last week,he wrote Powell‚Äôs termination""cannot come fast enough,‚Äù raising concerns that the president would seek to fire the central banker. Financial markets are clearly uncomfortable with thepoliticization of the central bank, Thierry Wizman, global currency and rates strategist at the Australian financial services firm Macquarie, said in an interview. ‚ÄúThe market is okay with rates coming down. What the market is not okay with is having the president or politicians tell the Fed that the rates need to come down,‚Äù Wizman said. Powell is no stranger to Trump‚Äôs attacks. Trump appointed Powell as Fed chairman during his first term as president, though he‚Äôd soon sour on Powell and criticize him publicly. In 2019, he questioned whether Powell was a bigger ‚Äúenemy‚Äù for the United States than Chinese President Xi Jinping. Despite his criticisms, Trump ultimately opted against removing Powell and thus avoided any legal fights that could ensue. Former President Joe Biden reappointed Powell as Fed chair for a term that is due to end in May 2026. In his second term, Trump has been more forceful in removing independent agency leaders, whether at the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board. It‚Äôs unclear whether he will bring that same view to the Fed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told the White House that firing Powell could prompt turmoil in financial markets, according toPolitico.But Kevin Hassett, a top Trump economic adviser, said on Friday that the White House will ‚Äúcontinue to study that matter.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be remiss to conclude that the president‚Äôs rhetoric won‚Äôt lead to action,‚Äù Ian Lyngen, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. If he does attempt to remove Powell, the question could end up in the Supreme Court, Lyngen wrote. ‚ÄúAt a moment in which the Administration has already instilled ever-higher levels of uncertainty into the economic outlook, any attempt to remove Powell will add to the downward pressure on U.S. assets,‚Äù he wrote.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/trump-criticism-of-powell-is-shaking-markets-faith-in-federal-reserve-independence-11719211,4
2025-04-21 23:00:00,Better AI Chip Stock: Nvidia vs. Broadcom,"When it comes to designing semiconductor chips used to powerartificial intelligence (AI)workloads, two companies stand head and shoulders above the rest:Nvidia(NVDA-4.36%)andBroadcom(AVGO-2.53%). Nvidia has been the biggest early winner in AI chips, but Broadcom has been gaining momentum. Let's see which stock investors should look to buy during this current market sell-off. Nvidia and Broadcom are taking two very different approaches to the AI chip market. Nvidia is the clear market leader ingraphics processing units (GPUs), where it holds a more than 80% market share. GPUs were originally designed to speed up graphics rendering in video games, but due to their fast processing power, they have become the main chips used to power AI workloads. The secret sauce behind Nvidia's huge market share is its CUDA software platform. It was the first software platform to allow developers to program GPUs for tasks beyond their original purpose, making it the standard on which developers learned to program GPUs. Since then, the company has built a collection of libraries and tools on top of CUDA, called CUDA X, that help enhance the efficiency and scalability of training AI models and improveinferencetimes. Broadcom, on the other hand, helps its customers develop custom AI chips called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are designed for very specific tasks. As such, these chips have better performance and consume less power than mass-market GPUs. The downside is that it takes considerable time to develop these custom chips and there are a lot of upfront costs, as well. They also don't provide that same type of flexibility as GPUs, which can be programmed for a variety of tasks. Not surprisingly, in the initial surge of the AI infrastructure buildout, Nvidia's GPUs were the most common chips that hyperscalers (operators of large data centers) used to train AI models and build out data center infrastructure to meet strong demand. After all, mass-market GPUs were much more readily available and Nvidia's CUDA software platform made them easily programmable for the tasks at hand. However, as Nvidia's GPU prices have skyrocketed due to its dominant market position, more and more companies have started to design their own AI custom chips with the help of Broadcom.Alphabetwas the company's first custom AI chip customer, with Broadcom helping it develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for its Google Cloud business. These chips are designed specifically to optimize AI workloads within Google Cloud's TensorFlow framework. Alphabet has credited them for improving performance, as well as reducing its operating costs due to their lower power consumption. Broadcom has progressively acquired more custom AI chip customers.Meta Platformsand OpenAI are reportedly the next companies to collaborate with Broadcom in developing AI chips. Broadcom has forecast that these three customers will have a serviceable market opportunity valued between $60 billion and $90 billion for its fiscal year 2027 (ending in October 2027). Currently, Broadcom's annual AI revenue run rate stands at just over $16 billion, indicating a significant growth potential. Meanwhile, the company has added additional custom AI chip customers beyond its initial three.Appleand TikTok owner ByteDance are widely believed to be its next two customers that are furthest along in their development. It took about 15 months for Alphabet to go from design to production for its chips, which gives a general time frame of how long it could take before these customers can become meaningful revenue contributors. Broadcom has also hinted at two additional custom AI chip customers. Image source: Getty Images. From a valuation perspective, the companies trade at similarforward price-to-earnings (P/E)multiples of 21.5 times for Nvidia and 23 times for Broadcom. While Nvidia still has a strong opportunity in front of it, Broadcom appears to have the stronger growth prospects going forward. Part of this is due to the law of large numbers, as Nvidia has already grown its revenue by more than 380% over the past two years. Meanwhile, Broadcom has been making strong inroads into the AI chip space. Given the time and upfront costs involved with designing custom chips, Broadcom's customers will be using these chips for large projects. I think both companies should continue to win their fair share of the AI chip market and both will see solid growth. However, I prefer Broadcom's stock a bit more at current levels given the huge opportunity in front of it. Of course in the real world, you should be able to own both over the long run.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/21/better-ai-chip-stock-nvidia-vs-broadcom/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=62ddf56a-d9fb-427e-be1e-4a44d3ea8b23&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-21 23:39:00,Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Slides Ahead of Earnings Report,"Tesla (TSLA) shares skidded on Monday as investors await the EV maker‚Äôshighly anticipated quarterly results, due after Tuesday‚Äôs closing bell. The company releasedweaker-than-expected first-quarter delivery numbersearlier this month, and analysts have expressed concern about the impact that theTrump administration‚Äôs tariffswill have on the auto maker the remainder of the year. Market watchers will be looking for updates from CEO Elon Musk about how Washington‚Äôstrade warwith China stands to affect Tesla. Tesla shares have reversed gear in 2025, slumping 44% since the start of the year amid concerns that Musk‚Äôs active involvement in the Trump administration has dented the automaker‚Äôs brand, hurting sales, anddistracted him from leading the company. The stock fell nearly 6% to $227.50 on Monday. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Tesla‚Äôs chart and identify important levels worth watching. Since finding a local bottom in early March, Tesla shares have consolidated within adescending triangle, a bearish chart pattern that signals acontinuationof the stock‚Äôs recent downtrend. Moreover, the50-day moving average (MA)crossed below the 200-day MA last week to form an ominousdeath cross, a technical event that forecasts lower prices. Meanwhile, therelative strength index (RSI)points to lackluster pricemomentum, with the stock‚Äôs recent upswing barely bumping the indicator back above the 50 threshold. Let‚Äôs identify two keysupportlevels on Tesla‚Äôs chart where the shares could attract buying interest amid further selling and also locate important overhead areas worth tracking during potential recovery efforts. Abreakdownbelow the descending channel‚Äôs lower trendline could see selling accelerate toward $170. Investors may look to place buylimit ordersin this location near the lower range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart throughout May and June last year. A more significant drop opens the door for amovedown to $139, a location on the chart that could attract strong support near last year‚Äôs prominent Aprilswing low. This area also sits just below a projected bars patterndownsidetarget that takes the stock‚Äôs downtrend following an earlier descending triangle on the chart and repositions it from the current pattern‚Äôs top trendline, with the analysis assuming a downward continuation move may play out. Amid potential recovery efforts in the stock, investors should keep a close eye on the $289 level. This region on the chart could provide considerable selling pressure near the 200-day MA, last month‚Äôsswing high, and the stock‚Äôs post-electionbreakaway gapclosing price. Further buying in Tesla shares could drive a move up to $360.

2025-04-22 02:47:32,Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Edge Computing Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?,"We recently published a list of13 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best edge computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Tech companies have been on a tear in recent years, particularly due to the rise of AI. However, other segments within the tech sector might warrant your attention, like cloud computing, particularly edge computing. Edge computing differs from cloud computing in that it brings computing power to where the data is created. Since data does not have to travel a lot, it can be processed much quicker compared to centralized computing, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). The amount of data being created is growing at an exponential rate as more devices are being connected to the internet. Edge computing makes things easier as data is processed close to where it is made. The edge computing market is expected to get a big push from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), with total spending projected to reach $380 billion by 2028, according to a new IDC report. Businesses are expected to gradually move away from traditional on-site hardware and instead put more money into cloud-based infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions that support AI workloads at the edge. IDC estimates that global spending on edge computing will hit $261 billion in 2025, and that number is expected to grow by nearly 14% each year. The main driver behind this surge is the increasing demand for powerful systems that can handle AI tasks. According to Alexandra Rotaru of IDC, the Internet of Things (IoT) still leads as the top use case for edge computing, but AI, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), robotics, and drones are quickly catching up. ‚ÄúIoT is still the biggest, but AI and AR are growing fast. In about a year, AI may become the fastest-growing area,‚Äù Rotaru said. Right now, most of the spending is going into on-premises setups‚Äîthings like servers and storage systems‚Äîto meet current needs. Rotaru noted that even though it‚Äôs already a large market, there‚Äôs still room for growth because this infrastructure is so important. IDC‚Äôs report looked at many industries and found that the biggest edge spending will come from retail, manufacturing, transportation, utilities, and finance. These sectors continue to invest in technology despite economic uncertainties. Rotaru added that recent surveys show businesses are more optimistic about IT spending in 2025 than they were for 2024. This confidence matches findings from a PwC Global AI Study, which reported that most business leaders see AI as a major advantage and are either using it or planning to adopt it soon. While companies are currently focused on buying hardware, IDC expects many to shift toward cloud and service-provider-based IaaS as time goes on. This opens the door for cloud companies to capitalize on their existing infrastructure. Rotaru said this shift is happening because cloud providers are becoming more capable of handling AI workloads at scale. We reviewed edge computing ETFs to compile a preliminary list of stocks and then selected the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q4 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

2025-04-22 08:36:00,Prediction: 8 Wall Street Analysts Lowered Nvidia's Price Target Last Week -- and This Is Just the Beginning,"For more than two years, no trend has captivated the attention of investors quite like the evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI). The ability for software and systems to reason, act, and potentially even evolve to learn new skills, all without the aid of human intervention, gives this technology a seemingly limitless ceiling. According to PwC'sSizing the Prize,AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030through a combination of productivity improvements and various consumption-side effects. This is a massive addressable market, with no company benefiting more in the early going than semiconductor colossusNvidia(NVDA-4.36%). In short order, Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and Blackwell GPU architecture grabbed hold of a monopoly like share of the AI-GPUs used in high-compute data centers. Overwhelming demand for the company's hardware, coupled with AI-GPU scarcity, led to exceptional pricing power and a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin that hit 78.4% during the fiscal first quarter of 2025 (ended April 28, 2024). But over the last week, Wall Street's optimism for its AI darling has noticeably soured -- and, in my view, this is likely just the beginning. Image source: Getty Images. While commentary from Wall Street analysts is often fluid,their price targets act as anchorsthat help investors gauge their longer-term sentiment toward a company. Last week, eight Wall Street analysts cut their price target on Nvidia: A majority of these price target adjustments occurred after Nvidia released a regulatory filing on April 15 where it disclosed apotential hit of up to $5.5 billion tied to exports of its high-powered H20 chips to China. Nvidia noted it would need to obtain a special license to export the H20 chip to the world's second-largest economy by gross domestic product. However, this filing shouldn't be a surprise. For three years prior to Donald Trump taking office the Joe Biden administrationclamped down on the export of AI-accelerating chips and equipment to China. The Biden administration added the A800 and H800 chips to the restricted export list, which are AI-GPUs Nvidia had developed specifically for the Chinese market. While some investors might be looking at this slip-up as the ideal opportunity to snag shares of Wall Street's Ai darling on the cheap, there's a realistic possibility we're witnessing the beginning of a wave of analyst price target cuts for Nvidia. Although Wall Street analysts tend to be reactive rather than proactive most of the time, the telltale figure that strongly suggests price target cuts are going to become something of the norm for Nvidia is its GAAP gross margin.  NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. As noted, a perfect storm of demand and limited supply allowed Nvidia to charge north of $40,000 for its Hopper chip early last year. This resulted in the aforementioned GAAP gross margin of 78.4%. Butin each subsequent quarter, Nvidia's GAAP gross margin has declined: This decline reflects bothan increase in competition within AI-accelerated data centers, as well as a decrease in AI-GPU scarcity. While most investors remain laser-focused on direct competitors to Nvidia's data-center dominance,its biggest threat has come from within. Most members of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which happen to be some of Nvidia's top customers by net sales, are internally developing AI-GPUs and solutions of their own. Even though these chips won't be sold externally, and they're likely to be slower than Nvidia's hardware on a compute basis, they're considerably cheaper than Nvidia's AI-GPUs, and there's no backlog. Nvidia is poised to lose data center real estate to these internally developed chips with each passing quarter. In turn, I expect this to steadily minimize AI-GPU scarcity and reduce the pricing power that's fueled the parabolic climb of Nvidia stock. Image source: Getty Images. A second issue that's likely to cause Wall Street's price targets for Nvidia to move lower is its product replacement cycle. Normally, innovation is everything in the tech sector. Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell chips are the clear leaders in compute speed in AI-accelerated data centers. It's why we've witnessed Nvidia's full-year sales skyrocket from $27 billion in fiscal 2023 to north of $130 billion in fiscal 2025. However, Nvidia's expediency of innovation, and its desire to maintain its lead in compute capacity, may not sit well with its current or prospective customers. After introducing the Hopper, Nvidia began rolling out Blackwell late last (calendar) year. Next in line is the Vera Rubin GPU architecture,which is expected to debut in 2026, followed by the Vera Rubin Ultra in the second-half of 2027. Both Vera Rubin chips will feature the all-new Vera processor. Butbringing a new AI-GPU to market annually comes with a cost. Previous buyers are likely to see the value of their AI hardware investments rapidly depreciate. Additionally, the improvements observed in compute capacity, high-bandwidth memory, and energy efficiency from one year to the next is likely to diminish over time. In other words, there's less of an incentive for Nvidia's clients -- especially its biggest customers -- to invest aggressively in the latest hardware. Last but certainly not least, history is likely to drag Wall Street's price targets on the companyconsiderablylower. For much of the last 30-plus years, investors have had a next-big-thing technology or innovation to captivate their attention. Though each of these trends offered juicy addressable markets, theone factor they've all shared was an eventual bubble-bursting event. Beginning with the internet in the mid-1990s, every next-big-thing trend has navigated its way through a bubble. The reason bubbles form is simple: investors overestimate the early stage adoption and/or utility of a new technology or innovation. At some point, lofty investor expectations fail to be met, which leads to the bubble bursting. Although Nvidia has enjoyed stellar demand for its AI hardware, what can't be ignored is that most businesses investing in AI have yet to optimize their solutions or generate a positive return on their investments. We're witnessing all the same telltale signs that investors have overestimated the early adoption and real-world use cases of artificial intelligence. The good news is that many of these game-changing trends went on to be successful. But the undeniable reality is that every next-big-thing technology/innovation needs plenty of time to mature. AI isn't anywhere close to being a mature technology, as of yet. Considering that Nvidia has benefited more than any other public company from the rise of artificial intelligence, an eventual bubble-bursting event would, in all likelihood,hit it harder than other AI stocks.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/22/8-wall-street-analysts-lowered-nvidia-price-target/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=cdc2e883-be8b-4900-9a02-8e3c93f453d0&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-22 09:18:00,Nvidia Is Expensive. Here Are 3 High-Yield Artificial Intelligence Plays That Aren't.,"Nvidia(NVDA-4.36%)has been one of the early beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend. The company's semiconductors provide the computing power AI needs to thrive. That's driven up Nvidia's profit and its valuation. While Nvidia's stock has fallen more than 30% from its recent peak over concerns aboutDeepseekand tariffs, it's still expensive at nearly 35 times earnings. That's much higher than theS&P 500, which trades at about 21 times earnings. The good news for more value-conscious investors is that there are much cheaper ways to invest in the AI megatrend.Dominion(D-1.98%),NextEra Energy(NEE-2.31%), andBrookfield Infrastructure(BIPC-0.54%)(BIP0.57%)stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as less expensive AI plays. Reuben Gregg Brewer(Dominion Energy):There are some reasons to dislike Dominion Energy, including a dividend cut a few years ago and the lack of dividend growth in recent years. However, this giant U.S. regulated utility is working toward a strongerbalance sheet, a peer-consistentpayout ratio, and a return to dividend growth. Helping to power the company's progress is its monopoly in Northern Virginia, one of the largest data center markets in the world. Asa regulated utility, Dominion Energy is granted a monopoly in the regions it serves in exchange for having its rates and capital investment plans overseen by state regulators. Slow and steady growth is the usual outcome, though sometimes utilities can get out over their skis. That's what happened to Dominion, but it has now reset the business so it's back on a more traditional path. The expectation is for 5% to 7% earnings growth over the foreseeable future, with dividend growth, when it resumes, likely to track along with earnings growth. AIfits neatly into the story because demand is exploding in Dominion's Virginia operations. Between July and December 2024 the company's pipeline of power requests from data centers increased 88%. Regulators are highly likely to approve capitalspending associatedwith this demand. That will help Dominion get back to dividend growth more quickly, which will probably result in a higher valuation for the shares. With a lofty 5% dividend yield today, that makes this both a near-term income play and a long-term capital appreciation play. And AI is a key factor in all of it. Neha Chamaria(NextEra Energy):According to the latest energy report from the International Energy Agency, AI-driven data centers alone could account for almost 50% of the growth in demand for electricity in the U.S. between now and 2030. At the same time, with emissions from data centers also expected to nearly double by 2030, global tech majors are increasingly seeking cleaner sources of energy to meet their future power demands. The combination perfectly sets the stage for growth for a company like NextEra Energy, which not only owns the largest electric utility in the U.S., Florida Power & Light, but is also the world's leading producer of energy from wind and solar and a leader in battery storage. The company also has large natural gas and nuclear fleets. Inrenewablesalone, NextEra Energy expects to develop 36.5 gigawatts (GW) to 46.5 GW of new capacity through 2027, which is more than its existing capacity in operation. The company expects the investments to drive its adjusted earnings per share higher by 6% to 8% between 2024 and 2027, and dividend per share by around 10% through at least 2026. NextEra Energy, in fact, is also deploying AI into its business. Its renewable energy arm, for instance, uses AI for land analysis to expedite discussions with landowners and regulators. In early 2025, NextEra Energy also struck an agreement withGE Vernovato build natural gas power solutions that are largely expected to support demand from data centers. WithNextEra Energy stock shedding almost 20% valuein the past six months, growing its dividend payout consistently, and yielding 3.5%, this one's an offbeat AI play you'd want to consider owning for the long term. Matt DiLallo(Brookfield Infrastructure):Brookfield Infrastructure is a leading global infrastructure operator. Its business spans utilities, energy midstream, transportation, and data infrastructure. The company estimates that businesses supplying more than 60% of itsfunds from operationswill benefit from digitalization catalysts likeAI. The company's data infrastructure platform is an obvious beneficiary of the AI megatrend. Brookfield operates a growing global data center platform. Those are crucial facilities in supporting the technology. The companyis also investingin semiconductor fabrication facilities and owns communication towers and fiber networks that will see additional growth from AI. On top of that, Brookfield's energy midstream andutilitiesassets will get a boost from AI's growing power demands. Natural gas will be a crucial fuel in supporting the always-on power needs of AI data centers. That will benefit Brookfield's gas storage, transportation, and distribution businesses. Brookfield sees a massive investment opportunity across its existing infrastructure platforms and new ones related to AI infrastructure. It estimates that the world will need to invest over $8 trillion in AI infrastructure, including semiconductor manufacturing, compute-as-a-service, energy management, autonomous transportation, robotics, and other technologies over the next three years.Itbelieves itcan play a key role in helping meet this massive investment requirement. Investors haven't even begun to price in Brookfield's AI-powered upside potential. The global infrastructure operator trades at around 11 times its FFO. That's dirt cheap for a company that expects to grow by more than 10%per year. It's why Brookfield currently offers such an attractive dividend yield of nearly 5%. The company's AI-powered upside could enable it to grow its dividend toward the high end of its 5% to 9% annual target range.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/22/nvidia-is-expensive-here-are-3-high-yield-artifici/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=ceb49aed-a024-49af-a993-533132aea2ea&.tsrc=rss,4

2025-04-22 11:15:00,3 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now,"Demand forartificial intelligence(AI) services is exploding. Some estimates believe it will be a $4.8 trillion market by 2033. Want to make sure your portfolio benefits? Each of these three stocks should benefit immensely from the rise of AI. But each has a slightly different angle of exposure. When it comes to investing in AI,Nvidia(NVDA-4.36%)remains king. AI models require specialized GPUs to operate, and according to most estimates, Nvidia has a 70% to 95% market share for AI GPUs. Its CUDA developer software, meanwhile, remains the go-to platform for customizing these chips for AI applications. Nvidia's early investment in AI-specific GPUs, and the 2006 release of its CUDA platform, paved the way for its current dominance. Put simply, Nvidia's dominance today has been a long time coming. With greater investment capacity than its competitors, plus impressive vendor lock-in through its CUDA developer suite, I expect Nvidia to retain its leading market share for many more years to come, even as competition begins to heat up. This proven winner, down 25% year-to-date, now offers long-term investors a discounted entry point. ThinkAmazon(AMZN-2.90%)is an e-commerce company? Think again. Just like Nvidia, Amazon sits at the center of the AI revolution, though most everyday investors remain unaware of this reality. The key to Amazon's AI exposure is its Amazon Web Services division, commonly referred to asAWS. Think of AWS as a distributed global computer that you can scale up and down with the press of a button. That's a huge benefit for AI developers, given their applications require a huge amount of compute power to train and execute their models. Cloud infrastructure like AWS allows them to do this significantly faster and cheaper versus building their own infrastructure. Last year, AWS contributed more than half of Amazon's total operating income, with segment revenues growing in the double digits. With a 30% global market share for cloud infrastructure, Amazon will remain at the center of the AI revolution for years to come. Want to swing for the fences with a tiny AI stock that could turn a small investment into millions of dollars? Check outSoundHound AI(SOUN-3.84%). This AI business has more risks than the two others listed, but the upside potential is clear. Nvidia and Amazon both have market caps above $1 trillion. SoundHound, meanwhile, is valued at just $3 billion. As its name suggests, SoundHound is involved in AI applications that deal with sound. Think drive-thru windows, customer support lines, or personal assistants operated by AI agents. This category of AI services is expected to grow rapidly, with estimates calling for 34% annual growth to reach a $20 billion market value by 2030. That's not as big as other AI markets, but with a current sales base of just $34.5 million last quarter, SoundHound has plenty of room to grow. The main issue here is competition. Plenty of big tech giants are also investing heavily in voice AI applications, and it's not clear if SoundHound's relatively small size will prevent it from competing long term. Plus, shares are fairly expensive at 31 times sales. But if you're looking to diversify your AI investment basket with a few higher-risk, higher-reward stocks, SoundHound is a prudent choice.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/22/3-millionaire-maker-artificial-intelligence-ai-sto/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=51b76014-5c3a-45ed-b95b-d8c2646e8db8&.tsrc=rss,4

Of what they're nervous about. So one of those two things have to happen. Sentiment shifts or we are going to have that sentiment lead us into a recession. Right. The CEOs are what gets a lot of headline, a lot of people's attention, right? Because to the extent that a CEO starts to say, ""Listen, I I'm going to just sit on my hands for now. Any any plans I had to invest and spend and hire, I'm going to put that on ice."" I mean, that is seems to me the big concern. Right. And if they pull back again, like right now it's not showing up in in earnings yet, right? And I don't think it'll show up in earnings for another couple weeks. But if it continues to go on, you're going to see the pull back in CAPEX, which going to have secondary third order effects, whether you're a software company, whether you're equipment provider, whatever it is, it's going to have effects if that doesn't turn. Now, some of this may turn naturally, right? Everyone's we're getting used to Trump again, right? Every tweet, every Truth Social post freaks people out. But I think over time, even though he's going to continue to do it, we'll be a bit more used to it. Yeah. Let me ask you, let's talk about some specific names and groups. I'm sure you must get questions, for example, about the MAG 7. Some of these names have gotten really banged up, right? Do you see opportunity in those names? Are you holding off? How do you think about them? Yeah. Yeah, I think it depends on which MAG 7 we're talking about. Like Apple is still down about 20% year to date. Um at one point it was down 30%. I think Apple, nothing fundamentally changed with their business. I think they're big enough, smart enough to get around the tariff issues where it hurts, obviously, small businesses. But from an Apple perspective, they'll be fine. Google, meta, both are in kind of their own self-created turmoil right now with the anti-trust issues. Yeah. So Uncle Sam has them in their sights. Yeah. I mean, they're at different levels. Like Google already has been found guilty. Now we're just deciding punishment phase, but I'm bullish on Google because we think the parts are worth more than the sum. So if they do get broken apart, YouTube's incredible trillion dollar business. Search, trillion dollar business. AdEx, really big hundred million dollar business. All these things are worth a ton of money. Meta is in a world of hurt, I think, because they don't have any friends right now. The Trump administration is going after them. The last administration was going after them. They don't like them. So anti-trust is inherently political. And so they have problems. And so they have problems. So Alphabet 2, I know you own and hold. Would you be adding here? Correct. Yeah, we're adding incrementally to Alphabet again. Right now, the tenuous nature of what the judgment is going to be is giving us pause from additional adding right now because that's going to hopefully come out here in the next week or two of what the decision there. That'll be appealed, but we need to know what the baseline is. And is the same for So meta, is that on the same the same thing? It's on your watch list, but you're not moving in yet? Yeah, we're a little hesitant on meta. If it wasn't for the trial right now, we'd be all in from a current valuation perspective. Meta is super appealing. Well, that's what I was going to ask you as we were talking about this. I was going to ask you, do you think some of that some of this bad news is priced in at this point? Well, that's what I going to ask you. We were talking about this. I was ask you, do you think some of that some of this bad news is priced in at this point? A little bit, but the uncertainty of exactly what the result is, because how I feel about Google is different how I feel about meta. I think meta needs to be together. If you broke that apart, Instagram here, uh Facebook over here, right? Um WhatsApp over there. I I don't think those work as well together separately as they do together. So I think it'll be interesting if they can sneak out with a fine as like a giant fine, right? As opposed to being broken up. I think that's their best case scenario right now is pay a couple billion dollar fine. Best case, couple billion. Jeff, great to see you always. I appreciate it.

2025-04-22 13:04:00,"Zacks.com featured highlights include National Fuel Gas, BGC, Jabil and NVIDIA","Chicago, IL ‚Äì April 22, 2025 ‚Äì Stocks in this week‚Äôs article are National Fuel Gas Co. NFG, BGC Group, Inc. BGC, Jabil JBL and NVIDIA NVDA. If you are looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks offering the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. The strategy helps investors gain exposure to undervalued stocks with impressive prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best value and growth investing.National Fuel Gas Co.,BGC Group, Inc.,JabilandNVIDIAare some GARP stocks that hold promise. The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on. Growth Metrics A strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy. Another metric that growth and GARP investors consider is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan. Value Metrics GARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics ‚Äî the price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Using the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term. Here are four stocks from the eight that made it through the screening process: National Fuel Gas Companyis an integrated energy company with natural gas assets located in the prolific Appalachian basin and oil-producing assets in California. The company operates through the following segments, namely Exploration and Production and Other, Pipeline and Storage and Gathering, and Utility and Energy Marketing. National Fuel Gas' systematic investments should strengthen its operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Strong liquidity should allow it to meet debt obligations. The company's steady process of replacing and modernizing the existing pipelines should further boost earnings. The company also acquired Shell's assets, which should further boost its top-line performance. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has surged 30.1% in the year-to-date period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.27%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFG's fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by 0.9% to $6.9 per share over the past 30 days. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. BGC Groupis a brokerage and financial technology company. Through its various affiliates, it specializes in the brokerage of a broad range of products, including Fixed Income, Foreign Exchange, Equities, Energy and Commodities, Shipping and Futures. The company recently completed the acquisition of OTC Global Holdings, LP, one of the fastest-growing energy and commodities brokerage firms. The OTC Global deal will likely provide highly complementary synergies by combining related energy and ship-broking teams. This collaboration will enhance market knowledge, generate unique trade ideas and drive deeper insights for more strategic decision-making. BGC Group is well-positioned to capitalize on growing environmental and energy transition trends and will keep benefiting from consistent global demand for oil, the single largest source of energy. As such, the company's top-line growth is anticipated to be impressive. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has declined 6.6% in the year-to-date period. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.26%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BGC Group's 2025 earnings has moved north by 5.2% to $1.22 per share over the past 30 days. Jabilis one of the largest global suppliers of electronic manufacturing services. The company offers electronics design, production, product management and after-market services to customers in the aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, industrial, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, storage and telecommunications industries. Jabil has an established global presence and a worldwide connected factory network, enabling it to scale production per evolving market dynamics. Strong performance in healthcare, automotive and transportation, coupled with growth in 5G, is expected to boost the top line. A higher free cash flow indicates optimum utilization of assets and improved operational efficiency. Management's focus on integrating advanced AI and ML capabilities is a tailwind. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has declined 6.2% in the year-to-date period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.86%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JBL's fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by 2.3% to $8.96 per share over the past 30 days. NVIDIAis the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU. Over the years, the company's focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA's Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. The continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market following the normalization of channel inventory is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with more than 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles space. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has moved south by 24.4% in the year-to-date period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.92%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA's fiscal 2026 earnings has moved south by 1.8% to $4.32 per share over the past 30 days.

2025-04-22 13:13:16,Huawei prepares to ship 910C AI chip as China looks beyond Nvidia ‚Äì report,Article body not found,News,https://www.verdict.co.uk/huawei-ai-chip-china-nvidia/?.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-22 13:35:00,Nvidia's China Risk: Is It a Red Flag for Investors?,"Shares ofNvidia(NVDA1.36%)tumbled last week after the company announced that it would take a charge of up to $5.5 billion related to China export restrictions. The company said it would no longer be able to export its H20 chip, a less powerful version of its H100 GPU and designed to comply with earlier export rules, without a license. Nvidia's filing implies that getting a license is unlikely. Wall Streetanalysts had varying estimates of the impact to Nvidia's bottom line. Wedbush said that the restriction would lower its revenue by 10%.Bank of Americasaid a ""dire"" tariffs scenario would reduce revenue by 9% to 13% in 2025 and 2026. The reduction in Nvidia's revenue will be more than the $5.5 billion charge since that reflects the cost of the chips rather than their selling price. The loss of revenue from China should be limited to roughly the percentage the analysts are estimating above as Nvidia reported $17.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, which ended in January 2025, or 13% of its total revenue. The percentage of Nvidia's revenue coming from China has declined in each of its last two years, so it seems like it would have fallen this year as well. It's unclear if Nvidia plans to replace the H20 with another less powerful chip, though it may give up on China altogether due to the political pressure as the export restrictions aren't Nvidia's only challenge. Image search: Getty Images. On Wednesday, the House Select Committee, focused on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), opened up an investigation demanding answers from Nvidia over its relationship with DeepSeek, the Chinese AI start-up. The report called DeepSeek a ""serious national security threat"" and noted that its models run on ""tens of thousands of Nvidia chips."" Committee Chairman John Moolenaar said DeepSeek is designed to ""spy on Americans"" and ""steal our technology,"" and that it used ""advanced Nvidia chips that should never have ended up in CCP hands."" Additionally, the report alleged that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ""directed the company to design a modified chip specifically to exploit regulatory loopholes"" following earlier restrictions. The committee alsosent a letterto Nvidia expressing concern that bad actors were diverting its chips to China against U.S. export rules, and it requested documents detailing the history of Nvidia's customer transactions in China and Southeast Asia. In a statement responding to the committee, Nvidia said, ""We follow the government's directions to the letter."" It's unclear what the consequences of the investigation, if any, will be for Nvidia. The company has never faced a significant fine over its business practices before, though it was a much smaller company for most of its history. It was fined $5.5 million as a result of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation-related disclosure around crypto mining and its gaming graphics processing units (GPUs) in 2022, and is now facing an antitrust investigation in both France and China. While the Congressional investigation could put a cloud over Nvidia's reputation in the near term, looking at it from another perspective, the investigation is almost a compliment to the company and its technology. By singling out Nvidia, the committee is essentially saying that its technology is so powerful and sought-after that it must be closely guarded so that the U.S. doesn't fall behind its primary global rival. Rep. Moolenaar concluded his statement by saying, ""American innovation should never be the engine of our adversaries' ambitions,"" though the innovation in question belongs to Nvidia, not the U.S. By treating Nvidia's chips as if they're nuclear secrets, the government seems to be giving the company special status. If the investigation reveals that Nvidia has complied with the law in its dealings with China and the surrounding region, this episode may only burnish the company's credentials. While the $5.5 billion charge and the related loss of business in China is disappointing, Nvidia can overcome that. Severe government sanctions would be more devastating. If the investigation clears Nvidia's name, however, the stock looks like an unquestionable buy as federal restrictions and intervention could be the biggest threat facing the company right now.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/22/nvidias-china-risk-is-it-a-red-flag-for-investors/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=00975fdb-aa4d-4a1e-b356-c2d11ad958f6&.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-22 13:56:42,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Price Target Cut to $160 Amid Tariff Uncertainty, Long-Term Growth Intact","We recently compiled a list of the12 AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks on Wall Street's radar. Almost 50 House Democrats have signed a message to stop the unauthorized use of AI tools in the government. Members of Congress have asked to cease applying any unauthorized artificial intelligence system that will aid in curbing government spending. President Donald Trump has set up DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency. Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk has been assigned the responsibility to cut what DOGE will say is waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal bureaucracy. READ NOW:10 AI Stocks You Shouldn‚Äôt Overlook Right Nowand10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility. The Democrats have acknowledged that artificial intelligence holds the potential to modernize the US government. However, it also highlighted the potential concerns related to employee monitoring and access to sensitive data by DOGE and its AI tools. ""These present serious security risks, self-dealing, and potential criminal liability if not handled correctly, and have the potential to undermine successful and appropriate AI adoption,"" The Democrats have further demanded that the administration terminate the use of any AI systems that haven‚Äôt been formally approved through processes such as FedRAMP or that have been unable to meet existing legal requirements. The letter, addressed to the White House Office of Management and Budget, was also questioned on whether any of the technology used by the administration was powered by Musk‚Äôs company, xAI. This question, in particular, has been asked to clarify any potential conflicts of interest. According to the Democrats, these would be ""exponentially worse if Musk pursues further contracts to become a major provider of government AI services."" The White House has recently introduced new policies on federal agency AI use and the federal government. ‚ÄúPresident Trump recognizes that AI is a technology that will define the future. This administration is focused on encouraging and promoting American AI innovation and global leadership, which starts with utilizing these emerging technologies within the Federal Government. Today‚Äôs revised memos offer much needed guidance on AI adoption and procurement that will remove unnecessary bureaucratic restrictions, allow agencies to be more efficient and cost-effective, and support a competitive American AI marketplace.‚Äù For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

One of the most notable analyst calls on Wall Street on April 16 was for Nvidia Corporation. Bank of America reiterated the stock as ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù and lowered its price target to $160 per share from $200. The price target revision comes amid tariff uncertainty. However, the firm believes that the stock is still well-positioned. ‚ÄúOur $160 PO is based on 26x CY26E PE ex cash, toward lower-end of NVDA‚Äôs historical 25x-56x forward year PE range, which we believe is justified given near-term concerns around cost inflation and tariffs, partially offset by stronger growth opportunities ahead as gaming cycle troughs and data center demand potentially faces strong, long-term demand dynamics.‚Äù Overall NVDAranks 5thon our list of the AI stocks on Wall Street's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Rival Northrop Grumman (NOC)'s stock also dropped sharply on costs related to the B-21 bomber. Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT) fell, too, even though the company's results topped estimates as it benefited from higher demand for its weapons. RTX, whose shares sank 9% soon after the opening bell, said if the tariffs last the year, it may see a negative impact onoperating profitof more than three-quarters of a billion dollars. It sees $250 million drops because of levies on Canada and Mexico, plus another $250 million hit from those on China and from China. Global reciprocal tariffs could cause an additional $300 million decline, and steel and aluminum tariffs would add another $50 million.

Sales sank 7% to $9.47 billion, also short of forecasts. The company blamed the weak results on a pre-tax loss of $477 million ($397 million after-tax or $2.74 per diluted share) because of five low-rate initial production (LRIP) options related to the B-21 program. It noted the slide was primarily caused by ""a process change made by the company to enable an accelerated production ramp, as well as increases in the projected cost and quantity of general procurement materials.""

2025-04-22 15:34:24,"'Wild, lumpy, volatile': Wall Street initiates coverage on CoreWeave stock after rocky public debut","CoreWeave (CRWV) stock popped Tuesday, rising over 8% as Wall Street analysts initiated coverage of the Nvidia-backed (NVDA) AI firm thatmade its public debut in late March. Some six analysts at investment firms, including JPMorgan (JPM), Barclays, and Jefferies, gave CoreWeave a Buy rating, as their bullish takes on the AI market outweighed worries over the stock's volatility. ""While there are concerns over the durability of CRWV's business model, we believe that the unrelenting appetite for AI compute minimizes the downside risks,"" said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who estimates shares will rise more than 40% to $51 over the next 12 months. Read more about CoreWeave's stock moves and today's market action. CoreWeave provides computing power to Big Tech, using its mass supply of Nvidia (NVDA) GPUs. In fact, CoreWeave is one of the largest holders of AI chips, period: JPMorgan estimates it has the fifth- to sixth-largest pool of GPUs in existence. ""We believe we're still in the very early innings of this buildout for AI, and CRWV being one of the few who has been able to scale & host AI compute reliably, is positioned well to capture this opportunity,"" Thill wrote. The company completed a rocky IPO in late March that wasrescued at the last minute by Nvidia, with the AI chipmaker and CoreWeave customer purchasing $250 million worth of CoreWeave shares and anchoring the price at $40. CoreWeave stock soared more than 50% to a high of over $60 in the days following its public debut, before losing almost half its value asPresident Trump's trade salvossent stocks across the board tumbling. Shares fell more than 9% on Monday, closing at $35. Bears remain concerned that CoreWeave's customers are highly concentrated. Some 77% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue came from just two customers, with 62% coming from Microsoft (MSFT). The cloud company and data center operator alsofaces $7.5 billion in debt repayments by the end of next year, the Financial Times reported. ""We remain cautious due to significant reliance on MSFT,"" wrote Citi analysts on Tuesday, giving CoreWeave a Neutral rating. ""This dependency poses risks as MSFT has signaled AI CapEx slowdowns."" Meta (META) and Big Tech ""hyperscalers"" ‚Äî the massive tech firms that operate mammoth data centers, including Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft ‚Äî are set to spend around $325 billion in 2025. CoreWeave also recently scoredan $11.9 billion contract with OpenAI,though the ChatGPT maker itself is losing money. But Big Tech's AI spending could die down as the companies look to generate a return on their mass infrastructure investments ‚Äî and that path to monetizing AI remains a fear factor for investors ‚Äî in an increasingly volatile macroeconomic environment. Additionally, there's a concern among investors that CoreWeave served only as a temporary backup for Big Tech during a shortage of GPUs in 2023 and 2024 as companies rushed to build out their AI capacity. And its current pool of Nvidia AI chips is set to depreciate over time. Microsoft has canceled some commitments with the company, according to the Financial Times.CoreWeave has denied the report. JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy, who holds a Buy rating but maintains a less bullish price target of $43 on shares, said, ""There could be a wide range of outcomes for CoreWeave."" ""For this reason, we expect the stock to provide a wild, lumpy, volatile ride, requiring a risk tolerance that may not exist for most investors,"" he added.

2025-04-22 15:40:05,"Walmart, Target Executives Meet Trump As Tariff Fears Spread","(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Most Read from Bloomberg DOGE Visits National Gallery of Art to Discuss Museum‚Äôs Legal Status Trump Gives New York ‚ÄòOne Last Chance‚Äô to End Congestion Fee Trump Administration Takes Over New York Penn Station Revamp The Racial Wealth Gap Is Not Just About Money President Donald Trump met with major retailers at the White House, as business executives seek relief from sweeping tariffs that have destabilized global supply chains and rattled US consumers. The Monday meeting included representatives from Walmart Inc., Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp., according to people familiar with the plans. The discussion came amid a 90-day pause in Trump‚Äôs higher tariffs on trading partners except China that dozens of foreign leaders and business executives are using to negotiate better terms. Listen to the Here‚Äôs Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. ‚ÄúWe had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers,‚Äù a Target spokesman said in an emailed statement. A Walmart spokeswoman also called the meeting productive and a Home Depot spokeswoman said the company looked forward to continuing constructive dialog with the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the discussion. Disruptions caused in large part by Trump‚Äôs tariffs have posed challenges for retailers that are main drivers of the US economy. A selloff in US assets deepened Monday amid tariff anxiety and Trump‚Äôs threats against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Shares of the companies ticked up after news of the meeting, but Walmart and Home Depot remained down for the day. Target rose less than 1% at the close of trading. American companies have warned that business could slow in the months ahead as the import taxes go into place. While companies have operated with tariffs for several years, the magnitude and fast-changing nature of Trump‚Äôs levies have become a unique problem. Trump‚Äôs duties on nearly all trading partners and a litany of sectors, including metals, are threatening to increase prices on everything from spirits and apparel to electronics and furniture. Those changes are expected to further hamper consumer demand, as Americans have already been price-sensitive following years of inflation. In addition to the cavalcade of overseas officials seeking lower tariffs, Trump has indicated he would be open to negotiating on rates with corporate leaders. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll also talk to companies. You know, you have to show a certain flexibility. Nobody should be so rigid,‚Äù the US president told reporters on April 13. Trump‚Äôs administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. The decision marked a temporary reprieve for global technology manufacturers, including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., though officials later said the US would craft other specific duties for those products and started the process by launching an investigation into semiconductor imports. Uncertainty around Trump‚Äôs tariffs have made it difficult for businesses to plan inventory and pricing. The 90-day pause has given some operators a temporary relief, though many have warned of the complications that come with not knowing where duty rates will end up. Earlier: How Tariffs Threaten to Drive Up US Clothes Prices: QuickTake Americans have been rushing to purchase items like cars, electronics and appliances before Trump‚Äôs levies take full effect, according to economic data. US retail sales surged 1.4% in March from the previous month, the biggest jump in more than two years, according a Commerce Department report. Auto purchases increased by 5.3% as buyers sought to avoid 25% tariffs on finished vehicles that went into place on April 3. The March data captured spending before Trump announced, then subsequently paused high tariffs on nations across the world, and before he hiked levies on many Chinese goods to 145%. But the report offers insight on consumers‚Äô mindset at a time of high uncertainty about future prices. Retailer Warnings Retailers have an especially close window into how the levies would affect consumers and the US economy, given that they sell many oft-purchased essentials. Walmart, the world‚Äôs largest retailer, has said it operates a diversified supply chain and that it sources about two-thirds of items in the US. Executives said this month that the company is working to keep prices low and that its merchants are thinking through the quantity of goods it needs, as well as how prices could change due to tariffs. So far, the company has not seen customers hoard like they did during the coronavirus pandemic. Target has not indicated how much of its items are sourced overseas, though it has previously said price increases would vary by category. The company has said it was having discussions with vendors and employees about next steps. Home Depot has said it sources more than half of its goods in North America. --With assistance from Matt Townsend, Jennifer A. Dlouhy and Phil Kuntz.

2025-04-22 15:59:23,Is NVIDIA (NVDA) the Most Promising Long-Term Stock According to Analysts?,"We recently published a list of the11 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other promising long-term stocks. On March 31, Banrion‚Äôs Shana Sissel recently appeared on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄòPower Lunch‚Äô to discuss that buying at lower valuations is favorable for long-term investors. Shana Sissel highlighted that the markets now want transparency, given the persistent volatility that has lasted for a while now. When this clarity is lacking, it becomes difficult for investors and businesses to plan for the long term. This uncertainty has led to soft consumer and CEO confidence, which makes it challenging to develop long-term strategies when key aspects such as industrial policy, business policy, and taxes remain unresolved in the US. Sissel emphasized that until there is more certainty, volatility is likely to persist. She expressed skepticism that any immediate announcements would provide the level of information investors desire, especially because of the administration‚Äôs habit of making statements that are later contradicted or revised. However, Sissel pointed out that long-term investors can find attractive buying opportunities if they look beyond the current uncertainty. She noted that the recent drop in valuations for many tech stocks now presents favorable buying opportunities for long-term investors. Regardless of the short-term fluctuations in policy uncertainty, many tech and security companies still benefit from long-term demand due to trends like the ongoing adoption of AI and the growing need for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection. Even when government decisions are unclear, these sectors are resilient because their products and services address fundamental needs that are unlikely to change with fluctuating market cycles. We first sifted through the Finviz stock screener and financial media reports to compile a list of the top stocks with high upside potential of over 40%. We then selected 11 stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 20%. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024, which was sourced from Insider Monkey‚Äôs database. Note: All data was sourced on April 21. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 39.48% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 Average Upside Potential as of April 21: 65.53% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company that offers graphics and compute & networking solutions internationally. It sells its products to original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators and distributors, independent software vendors, cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, and others. The growing adoption of NVIDIA‚Äôs Blackwell architecture is driving its revenue. In FQ4 2025, Blackwell‚Äôs revenue totaled $11 billion, which marked the fastest product ramp in the company‚Äôs history. Blackwell delivers ~25 times higher token throughput and 20 times lower cost than the Hopper 100 for reasoning AI. Large cloud service providers like Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI are deploying Blackwell systems to meet their growing demand for AI infrastructure. The overall Data Center segment at NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) made a record $35.6 billion in revenue in FQ4, which was a 93% year-over-year improvement. For the entire fiscal year 2025, the revenue doubled. However, Argus lowered the stock‚Äôs price target to $150 from $175 while keeping a Buy rating on April 17. The firm believes that the fresh US licensing requirements for AI chip exports, which include NVIDIA‚Äôs H20 models, will potentially impact quarterly earnings by as much as $55 billion. Guinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024investor letter: ‚ÄúFor a second year running,NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund‚Äôs top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia‚Äôs ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia‚Äôs extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to ‚Äúinference‚Äù (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia‚Äôs financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia‚Äôs data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia‚Äôs technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia‚Äôs valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 6thon our list of the 11 most promising long-term stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The analysts pointed out the significant uncertainty and potential damage to the US and global economies, particularly the US tech industry, which has been thrust into the eye of the storm. The imposition of tariffs and the subsequent ban on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)‚Äôs H20 chip in China have led to a blockade from the Chinese market, with Chinese tech giant Huawei set to release its 910C AI GPU chip for mass shipments by early May. This move is seen as a direct consequence of the trade war, which is perceived to be undercutting US tech companies while propelling Chinese tech firms forward. The tech industry is facing a whirlwind of challenges as the supply chain is disrupted, raising questions about product releases from major companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), as well as the impact on AI deployments and capital expenditure plans in the US, Ives highlighted. The lack of clarity and guidance is expected to lead to a cautious earnings season, as companies are unable to plan effectively without knowing the ""rules of the game."" ""Does Apple still release its iPhone 17 this September?,"" Ives asks. ""How will Tesla unveil its lower cost vehicle? What will this unprecedented uncertainty do for AI deployments and overall Cap-Ex plans in the US? Many questions..no answers for now."" Wedbush emphasizes the critical nature of progress in trade negotiations, particularly with China, warning that a prolonged period without deals could lead to a loss of confidence in the market and corporations, potentially triggering a pullback in purchases, budgets, hiring, and raising fears of recession or stagflation. The analysts underscored the importance of the US maintaining its lead in AI and what he calls the fourth Industrial Revolution. ""For the first time in 30 years the US is ahead of China when it comes to AI and this 4th Industrial Revolution...being led by Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Tesla among others,"" Ives commented. ""However, this self-inflicted tariff and trade war has created an upside down supply chain that is holding US tech stalwarts like Nvidia and Apple back..while handing a growth opportunity on a silver platter to Chinese tech players like Huawei."" The call to action is clear: trade agreements must be reached to prevent further setbacks for US tech leadership.

2025-04-22 18:09:26,Here's Where Traders Bet Tesla Stock Is Headed After Reporting Earnings Tuesday,"Tesla (TSLA) is set to report first-quarter earnings after the bell, and investors are hoping results can jolt the stock out of its recent malaise. Options pricing suggests traders are expecting Tesla stock to move roughly 11% in either direction in the days after Tuesday's report. Based on Tuesday afternoon's share price of about $241, that would put Tesla stock between $212 and $269 on Friday. A double-digit post-earnings move wouldn't be out of the ordinary for Tesla, one of the more volatilemega-cap stocks. After its four most recent quarterly reports, the company has seen its stock move 12.3% on average.Shares soared nearly 22% in October when the companybeat earnings estimatesand CEO Elon Musk said the company was ""on track"" to begin producing a model costing less than $30,000 this year. A lot has changed since October. President Donald Trump's tariffs could derail Musk's low-cost model plans. Trump's 25% duty on all foreign cars and car parts is expected to significantlyincrease the cost of all automobiles‚Äîeven Tesla's, which are assembled in the U.S. with some foreign parts. Musk may have to answer to investors concerned that his involvement with the White House is both distracting him from leading Tesla and damaging the brand. Tesla dealerships have become a regular target of anti-Trump protests, and international sales have plummeted amida global backlashto Musk's political interventions. Tesla's first-quarter deliveriesfell short of analysts' estimates, which had already been lowered since the start of the year. Trump's tariffs are expected to loom large over this round of corporate earnings reports. Analysts areexpecting a slumpin the number of companies issuing earnings guidance. According to a recent JPMorgan analysis, traders are also expecting the most post-earnings stock volatility since the first quarter of 2020, when companies reported earnings at the height of Covid uncertainty.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/here-is-where-traders-bet-tesla-stock-is-headed-after-reporting-earnings-tuesday-11719816,4
2025-04-22 18:13:06,Why Nvidia Stock Is Jumping Today,"Nvidia(NVDA1.36%)stock is moving higher on Tuesday as the broader market rebounds from Monday's declines. The GPU leader's share price was up by 2.4% as of 12:48 p.m. ET. At the same point in the day, theS&P 500was up 2.6%, and theNasdaq Compositehad risen 3%. Nvidia stock had been up as much as 3% earlier in the session. Stocks sold off Monday after President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the central bank's interest rate policy, but the market is recovering some of that lost ground, apparently in response to some optimism out of Washington on the trade war front. In addition to the broader market's momentum, Nvidia stock is likely also benefiting from new analyst reports that were published Tuesday morning. The S&P 500 fell 2.4% Monday, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.6%. In addition to the widespread sell-offs driven by macroeconomic concerns, Nvidia stock also lost ground after a report was published stating that one of its upcoming chips could be delayed due to undisclosed flaws. The artificial intelligence (AI) hardware leader's share price fell roughly 4.8% in Monday's trading, but it's seeing a recovery Tuesday as major indexes move higher. Before the market opened Tuesday morning,Barclayspublished new coverage on Nvidia. Tom O'Malley, the firm's lead analyst on the stock, lowered his one-year price target from $175 per share to $155 per share in response to tariff and trade-war pressures. On the other hand, O'Malley reiterated his overweight rating on the stock, which is equivalent to a buy rating. Bank of Americaalso lowered its price target on Nvidia stock from $160 per share to $150 per share. Despite that cut, the bank thinks that the impact of the U.S. effectively banning the export of Nvidia's H20 AI processor to China has already been largely baked into the stock, and that the business will still post earnings per share of $3.97 in this fiscal year and $5.74 next fiscal year. The bank reiterated its buy rating on Nvidia. While Barclays and Bank of America both lowered their near-term valuation forecasts on the chipmaker, both of their new targets still imply upside of more than 50% from its share current price. However, investors should keep in mind that macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics are shifting rapidly these days. For better or worse, the factors that underpin analysts' price targets could change in short order.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/22/why-nvidia-stock-is-jumping-today/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=01fb6481-742c-4c10-aaf9-2578db5ea4ab&.tsrc=rss,4

2025-04-22 18:22:08,NVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) Partners With Vertiv To Launch Sovereign AI Data Center In Italy,"NVIDIArecently collaborated with Vertiv to establish the Colosseum AI data center in Italy, strengthening its position in the AI sector. Despite the announcement, NVIDIA's stock experienced a 12% decline over the past week, coinciding with a broader market downturn of 4.4%. This price movement may have been influenced by the announcement but also reflects overall market trends, as technology stocks faced numerous challenges amid tariff uncertainties and Federal Reserve concerns. Within a week marked by varied performance among tech giants, NVIDIA's developments provided slight resistance to the prevailing negative market sentiment. We've discovered 2 weaknesses for NVIDIA (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here. Uncover 10 companies that survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs. The recent collaboration between NVIDIA and Vertiv for the establishment of the Colosseum AI data center in Italy could bolster NVIDIA's foothold in the AI sector, potentially impacting its revenue and earnings positively by enhancing its AI capacities. However, despite this development, NVIDIA's shares recorded a 12% decline in the past week, highlighting broader market turbulence as a possible influence, in addition to the specific announcement. In the backdrop of these short-term dynamics, NVIDIA's total return over five years was very large at 1209.64%, indicating substantial growth compared to a relatively stable US semiconductor industry in the past year. Over the longer term, NVIDIA's earnings growth of 146.9% in the last year starkly contrasts with the semiconductor industry's 5.9% decline, reflecting its stronger recent performance. With a current share price of US$104.49 and an analyst price target of US$166.59, there's a potential upside of 37.3%, assuming financial metrics align with forecasted earnings and revenue developments. The partnership with Toyota and Uber can further NVIDIA's AI reach in the automotive sector, likely fueling long-term revenue streams. Analysts forecast NVIDIA's earnings to reach US$158.8 billion by 2028, with a necessary PE ratio of 32.2x to justify current price targets, presenting both opportunities and challenges ahead. In light of our recent valuation report, it seems possible that NVIDIA is trading behind its estimated value.

U.S. tariffs against China are as high as 245% on certain products, according to the White House. Economists and business leaders have warnedof far-reaching effects from the new trade barriersbetween the world's two largest economies, which are heavily intertwined. For instance, American consumerscould face higher prices and shortageson certain products, such as toys.Stock markets rallied Tuesday afternoon after Bessent's comments were reported, with the S&P 500 stock index up nearly 2% on the day.

Gratitude is no longer important in the tech world. Although users may be using these words to remain on AI‚Äôs good side in the event it takes over, it is costing companies millions of dollars. In the latest news, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed how showing good manners to a ChatGPT model, such as saying ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù adds up to millions of dollars in operational expenses. When asked how much the company has lost in electricity costs from people being polite, this is what Altman had to say: ‚ÄúTens of millions of dollars well spent ‚Äî you never know.‚Äù While that may be so, Kurt Beavers, a director on the design team for Microsoft Copilot, noted how ‚Äúusing polite language sets a tone for the response,‚Äù and that when an AI model ‚Äúclocks politeness, it‚Äôs more likely to be polite back.‚Äù READ ALSO:Top 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Weekand10 AI Stocks You Shouldn‚Äôt Overlook Right Now. Even though politeness may come at a cost for the ChatGPT maker, these may be trivial when it comes to the immense scale at which the company operates itself. The company has recently released its latest artificial intelligence model, claiming that it can ‚Äú think with images‚Äù. The main new reasoning model from OpenAI is known as the o3, while the smaller model released simultaneously is known as the o4-mini. The o3 allows users to upload whiteboards, sketches, and other images that AI can analyze and discuss. The company is fiercely competing to stay ahead in the artificial intelligence race, facing intense competition from companies such as Google and Anthropic. ‚ÄúFor the first time, our reasoning models can independently use all ChatGPT tools ‚Äî web browsing, Python, image understanding, and image generation. This helps them solve complex, multi-step problems more effectively and take real steps toward acting independently.‚Äù O3 and o4-mini are OpenAI‚Äôs first AI models that have the ability to ‚Äúthink with images.‚Äù This implies that ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt just see an image, they can integrate visual information directly into the reasoning chain,‚Äù OpenAI noted.

2025-04-23 12:51:59,Stock market today: Markets bounce after Trump says he won‚Äôt try to fire Fed Chair Powell,"By STAN CHOE, AP Writer NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as a worldwide rally came back around to Wall Street after¬†President Donald Trump¬†appeared to back off¬†his criticism of the Federal Reserve¬†and¬†his tough talk in his trade war. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its¬†big gain¬†from Tuesday that more than made up for a¬†steep loss¬†on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%. Wall Street‚Äôs gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies. The market‚Äôs latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has ‚Äúno intention‚Äù to fire¬†the head¬†of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called ‚Äúa major loser,‚Äù because of the Fed‚Äôs¬†hesitance to cut interest rates. Trump‚Äôs tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term. While a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Economists say Trump‚Äôs tariffs are likely both to slow the economy and to raise inflation, at least briefly. Trump may have recognized the market‚Äôs fear about a move against Powell. He may also be looking to keep someone around whom Trump could blame later if the economy does fall into a recession, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.    ‚ÄúIndeed, if the Fed cuts its policy interest rates aggressively, Trump would have little excuse for a recession apart from the pugnacity of his tariff policies,‚Äù Wizman said. Markets also rose after Trump said late Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down ‚Äúsubstantially‚Äù from the current 145%. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be that high, not going to be that high,‚Äù Trump said. The hope along Wall Street has been that Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries, and Trump said Tuesday he would be ‚Äúvery nice‚Äù to the world‚Äôs second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President¬†Xi Jinping. ‚ÄúThere is an opportunity for a big deal here,‚Äù U.S. Treasury Secretary¬†Scott Bessent said Wednesday. If Trump brings his tariffs down enough, investors believe a recession could be averted.

A preliminary reading of U.S. business activity fell to a 16-month low, as the threat of tariffs helped push up prices charged for goods and services, according to S&P Global‚Äôs latest survey released Wednesday. All the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will ‚Äúmore likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump‚Äôs latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,‚Äù said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. The S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration‚Äôs officials continue to surprise markets. On Wednesday alone, the S&P 500 charged to a 3.4% gain in the morning, only to more than halve that rise as the day progressed. Trump‚Äôs latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. It‚Äôs a turnaround from earlier this month, when spiking Treasury yields raised fears that Trump‚Äôs actions were scaring investors away from the United States and weakening the U.S. bond market‚Äôs reputation as one of the safest places to keep cash. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning. On Wall Street, Big Tech helped lead stock indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip company‚Äôs stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500. Other stocks in the artificial-intelligence technology ecosystem also drove higher. Vertiv Holdings, which traces its roots to the industry‚Äôs first manufacturer of computer room air conditioning, jumped 8.5% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said it‚Äôs continuing to see accelerated demand from AI data centers. Super Micro Computer, a company that makes servers used in AI, rose 7.6%. Palantir Technologies, which offers an AI platform for customers, climbed 7.3%. Tesla revved 5.4% higher after CEO¬†Elon Musk said he‚Äôll spend less time in Washington¬†and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla on late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. It‚Äôs been struggling because of¬†backlash¬†against Musk‚Äôs efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the U.S. government. All told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 419.59 to 39,606.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 407.63 to 16,708.05. In stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.1% in France, 2.4% in Hong Kong and 1.9% in Japan. Stocks in Shanghai were an exception, where they dipped 0.1%.

2025-04-23 14:31:49,Tesla: A Long-Term Growth Play But Short-Term Challenges Remain,"Despite a forward P/E of 83.1x, Tesla‚Äôs high valuation, mixed analyst sentiment, and insider selling suggest holding current positions until margin clarity and demand stabilization materialize By Nabeel Bukhari  Summary  Tesla is investing $5B in AI, including the development of the Cortex AI training cluster, but heavy spending may limit short-term profitability and margin improvements in 2025. The company aims to deploy 10,000 Optimus humanoid robots by 2025, while energy storage efforts like Megapack are expected to grow by 50% in 2025, despite supply chain constraints. Cash reserves reached $37B, with retained earnings growing 26% year-over-year in 2024, but higher operating costs and slower revenue growth pose operational risks.  Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart.   Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots.  Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power.   That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. MORE FOR YOUGoogle Starts Scanning Your Photos‚Äî3 Billion Users Must Now DecideDOGE-Trolling Ransomware Hackers Demand $1 TrillionApple Brings Back iPhone 15 Pro And 15 Pro Max For The 1st Time ‚Äî At Lower Prices Tesla's bets big for 2025 Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability.  TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth.Tesla Inc Share Price ChartGuruFocus  Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps.   An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025. Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth. Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus. Q4 Financial Performance & Outlook The end of Q4 2024 brought Tesla both difficult situations and major developments. Revenue growth remained slow while costs mounted as the company maintained its forward momentum. Without further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Strong balance sheet and smart growth: The increase of assets at a faster rate than liabilities leads to higher equity. It is a positive sign for investors. Tesla maintains an impressive standing on its balance sheet report. It has a mind-boggling $37 billion in cash and marketable securities which creates a net cash balance of about $30 billion. This big reserve allows Tesla to constantly put efforts into pursuing its visionary initiatives.Tesla Balance Sheet Breakdown ChartGuruFocus But certainly, there is another important factor which is debt. Tesla has $8.2 billion in debt but only $4.3 billion of it is in the form of asset-backed notes. Instead of using its core business as the source of its liquidity, Tesla tapped its lease portfolio to issue debt. This made the company convert future lease payments into immediately available cash. As such, the lease cash flows fully support this debt and hence reduce financial strain. Meanwhile, the retained earnings kept on growing. They rose 116% from 2022 to 2023 and 26% more in 2024. This leads to them being over $35 billion now. This is different from most companies that distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. This goes to show how Tesla is dedicated to reinvesting for lasting growth. Takeaway? Tesla has ample cash reserves and a well-managed debt structure. It is also growing retained earnings to have the best financial stability and future expansion. Growth Under Cost Pressures: Tesla's total revenue only grew 2% to $25.7 billion from $23.35 billion in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, it was up just 1% to $97.6 billion from $96.7 billion for the full year. Most of this sluggish growth was a result of a lower average selling price for the S3XY lineup and more attractive financing options to help keep demand. These strategies enhanced the unit sales but at the cost of squeezing margins. On the cost side, it was able to achieve all-time lows in the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, coming in at $35,000 in Q4 2024. That said, high operating expenses wiped this out since the company continued to pour hefty investments into AI and R&D projects. While these initiatives are important for long-term innovation, they also bring near-term pressure on profitability. In addition, a one-time charge of $624 million for restructuring further reduced earnings. It is pertinent to mention here that a $5.9 billion deferred tax asset benefit artificially inflated the company's net income in 2023. Thus, the YOY comparison would not be fair in this regard. Spending big and building for the future: Tesla's net cash from operations has surged significantly over the past half-decade. Nevertheless, the growth in 2023 and 2024 has flatlined, mainly because of growing capital expenditures and inventory buildup. In the past 12 months, the company has been spending heavily on innovations already mentioned above. The spending has boomed from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $11.6 billion in 2025. These heavy investments have not hindered Tesla from producing a strong free cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2024. Though this indicates a leveling off of cash generation. The positive aspect is that Tesla can sustain cash generation as costs go up. This stability implies that the company is in the early days of high burn growth, and is now moving into a more self-sustaining model. Meanwhile, Tesla is cutting debt and is heading toward financial stability instead of relying on external funding. Cutting cash from external funding is evident as net cash from financing decreased from $9.9 billion in 2020 to a mere $3.8 billion in 2024. This shift of capital represents increasing financial independence towards a long-term stable existence. Additionally, Tesla has seen over $40 billion in proceeds from investments between 2022 and 2024. It is a significant surplus of cash. Such a large cash influx shows that Tesla does not solely rely on operating cash flow to fuel its aggressive expansion. That said, the seemingly attractive financial figures do not show how timing elements fuel most of Tesla's operational cash flow growth. If things turn unfavorable in terms of working capital such as inventory accumulation or slower payments collection. It would have the potential to create strain on its future cash flow situation. Additionally, Tesla maintains significant investments in new battery facilities and gigafactories that drive net cash used for investing to stay high, especially during the fourth quarter. The trend of high capital expenditures will continue in the near term because its expansion activities depend on ongoing spending. Valuation stretched, sentiment divided The premium valuation of Tesla reflects a massive disconnect from its peers. TSLA stock trades at a significant premium to its tech and auto industry peers given its forward P/E of 98.89x. Microsoft and Apple trade at 29.46x and 27.89x respectively. With a strong leadership in AI, Nvidia trades at 24.45x. Despite strong fundamentals, Meta trades at only 21.21x and Amazon trades at 28.85x. Last but not least, Alphabet trades at a modest 17.74x, making it the most affordable stock in the group. It signals that Tesla is actually valued more like a high-growth tech company rather than a traditional automaker.Tesla Valuation MetricsAuthor Generated Based on Data Subsequently, Tesla's potential for execution of what it is betting on will finally decide whether it was ever worth what it's been valued at. Tesla's success would lead to the company even outperforming Nvidia's AI level growth. However, accepting its premium pricing is valid for those who believe in its anticipated transformation. According to GuruFocus, the average price target for Tesla is $296.76 based on the one-year price targets offered by 44 analysis, an upside of approximately 20.28%. The estimates vary widely from $19.01 to $465.70 which indicate the speculative potential of the stock. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $289.51, suggesting a upside of +17.34% from the current price of $246.73.Tesla 12 Month Price TargetsGuruFocus Tesla's expansion into energy, pushing AI, and self-driving are nice growth drivers to unlock plenty of value. However, the margins are still under pressure and the demand is still fluctuating. In my point of view, Tesla is a long-term growth story centered around AI, self-driving and energy expansion. Within a year, I expect Tesla to range between $280 and $320. Meanwhile, if full self-driving gets approved for regulatory use and energy storage scales faster than expected, the stock would be able to break through the $350 barrier. Potential investors should exercise caution when investing at Tesla's current high market price because of existing uncertainties. Mixed signals from insiders and gurus reinforce caution Tesla remains a battleground stock, between not only retail investors, but also among guru investors and insiders. Latest guru trades display a split view. At the end of 2024, Ken Fisher , Jefferies Group, and Ray Dalio all increased their TSLA positions, with Jefferies‚Äô position jumping to over a solid 1,700% to show strong belief in the story behind Tesla‚Äôs innovation. However, leading investors such as Baillie Gifford, Cathie Wood, and Ron Baron reduced their holding, presumably to cash in on the stock's quick spike. The divergence reflects other uncertainty around the company's short-term performance and long-term strategy, especially after geopolitical tensions and tariff shocks that knocked billions off its market cap in recent months.Tesla Number of Guru TradesGuruFocus The absence of insider activity, or the lack thereof, is what adds a note of caution. As it can be seen in the chart below, Tesla has not experienced a single insider buy in the past three years. On the contrary, about 61 million shares have been sold. The sheer volume and total lack of purchases raises questions. This may indicate that those closest to the business think the stock is fairly valued or even stretched at today's levels.Tesla Insider Buys and Sells VolumeGuruFocus That said, Tesla is a long-term story, but this combination of guru hesitation and insider selling suggests that for now, investors are better off simply hanging onto any current position than jumping in and buying at the current levels. More prudent path right now would be waiting for greater clarity around margins, AI execution, and demand stabilization. Your takeaway The growth story of Tesla remains intact because the company continues advancing its AI systems and self-driving technology and energy sector expansion initiatives. The current stock valuation requires you to exercise caution because multiple short-term uncertainties exist concerning future demands together with profit margins and operational execution. Tesla presents significant potential across several sectors but premium price points and conflicting signals between insiders and analysts suggest that one should hold the current positions at this time.

Stocks surged Wednesday as the market celebrated a less hawkish White House.AFP via Getty Images  Key Facts   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,080 points, or 2.8%, by mid morning, while the S&P 500 soared 3.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 4.2% by 10:30 a.m. EDT, before pulling back, as the Dow closed up 420 points, or 1.1%, and the S&P and Nasdaq booked 1.7% and 2.5% respective gains.    Wednesday‚Äôs spike came after Trump‚Äôs comments after Tuesday‚Äôs market close sent stock futures up, as the president said the 145% tariffs on Chinese goods will ‚Äúcome down substantially‚Äù and he has ‚Äúno intention of firing‚Äù Powell.    ‚ÄúThe market may have reached a juncture where the initial shock and awe from the relentless news cycle has largely subsided,‚Äù Nationwide‚Äôs chief market strategist Mark Hackett wrote in emailed comments.    Further driving gains after Wednesday‚Äôs open was The Wall Street Journal reporting the Trump administration intends to lower Chinese tariffs to 50% to 65%, cutting the levies by more than half.     Crucial Quote ‚Äú‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô does not mean America alone,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a morning speech at the Institute of International Finance Global Outlook Forum, nodding to one of Trump‚Äôs signature slogans and signaling the White House shift away from its most hawkish trade position. Bessent called for ‚Äúdeeper collaboration and mutual respect‚Äù between the U.S. and its trading partners. What Stocks Rose The Most Wednesday? All but two of the 13 S&P sectors rose Wednesday, though the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors, considered the stocks most sensitive to shifting risk appetites, rose the most. Shares of Amazon and Tesla soared about 5% apiece while Apple and Nvidia stocks rose 2% and 4%, respectively. Among the other top individual risers were Boeing, Palantir and RTX.

2025-04-23 16:48:07,What‚Äôs Happening With Palantir Stock?,"POLAND - 2024/11/21: In this photo illustration, the Palantir company logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images S&P is down 6% in April. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) is up 11%? That‚Äôs not bullish. That‚Äôs bizarre, considering the numbers you see when you lift the curtain. Tariffs are hammering tech, semiconductors are shaking, growth stocks are bleeding, and Palantir - a stock trading at PE multiple of 700 is rising? Either we‚Äôre witnessing brilliance or a bubble inflating before our eyes.   And bubbles pop. When they do, you don‚Äôt want to be left holding nothing. This is why investing in a single stock, no matter how lucrative, can be very risky. We diversify away that risk while being exposed to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception.  Let‚Äôs break Palantir down.  Why Is Palantir So Hot Right Now?  It‚Äôs not fundamentals driving this. It‚Äôs euphoria supercharged by three powerful story lines:  [1] AI Buzz = Investor Sugar High Palantir calls itself an ‚ÄúAI company‚Äù now. That label alone triggers algos and retail fear-of-missing-out.  Its Gotham and Foundry platforms do integrate machine learning. But it‚Äôs still fundamentally a data consultancy business for the government and large enterprises. This isn‚Äôt Nvidia. And it‚Äôs definitely not Google.  Still, AI hype alone can send any ticker vertical. Just ask C3.ai - that reached highs of $180+ before falling to a mere $10.

That‚Äôs the kind of move that breaks valuation anchors. People stop asking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs it worth?‚Äù and start asking ‚Äúhow high can it go?‚Äù  3M return: +22% 6M return: +116% 12M return: +348% 3Y return: +686%  [3] Retail Crowd Favorite Palantir is a retail darling - with a CEO (Alex Karp) who talks like a philosopher and a cult-like following that sees it as the next Palantir-for-planet-earth operating system.  But sentiment isn‚Äôt a moat. And it isn‚Äôt a reason to buy. The Red Flags Are Staring At You   Palantir bulls love to talk about potential. But here‚Äôs what the data actually says:  PE Multiple: A massive 450x ! Revenue Growth: Great at 29% in the last 12 months, but Nvidia‚Äôs is way higher at 114% and that‚Äôs actually a company that is powering the AI revolution. Despite this, Nvidia‚Äôs PE is at 33x. Margins: Sure, improving fast but there is a limit. Net margin is already at 16%, even if it were to rise to 30%, it still does not justify the outrageous multiple. And remember this, Nvidia is already at 55%+ margin and commands less than 1/10th the multiple vs PLTR Market Cap: $212 billion, richer than many cash generating S&P giants  Preserve & Grow Wealth With Risk-Focused Quality Portfolios There are times to ride such momentum, but in the case of Palantir, that time is gone. Valuation multiples mean something. Evaluating multiples in the context of growth and margin expansion is one of the factors we consider in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

2025-04-23 19:43:22,Your 3% Dividend Yield Could Be 9%‚ÄîHere's What You're Missing,"Many dividend-focused investors are getting modest yields when they could be considering higher-income investments. While theS&P 500 Index's average dividend yield languishes below 2%‚Äî""much lower than historical dividend yields,"" Sahil Vakil, a financial advisor and founder of MYRA, told Investopedia‚Äîsavvy income investors are often obtaining higher payouts elsewhere. ""The most common misconception about dividend yields is that a high yield is always a good thing and a sign of a strong investment,"" Vakil said. ""Investors often focus solely on the dividend yield percentage without considering the underlying reasons for it, such as a declining stock price or a company's ability to sustain dividend payouts."" The task, then, is to find higher-yield investments without investing your money in something that is unsustainable or carries excessive risk. We examine two higher-yielding options below. While dividend investing remains a cornerstone strategy for many, the reality is stark: the S&P 500's average dividend yield hovers below 2%. The decline is part of a fundamental shift in what companies do with their money, often favoring stockbuybacksoverdividends‚Äîin short, using the funds to increase their stock price over stockholder distributions. For retirees or those approaching retirement, this yield gap presents a particular challenge, especially as yields can shift with broader economic changes. ""Dividend growth investment strategy is impacted by many direct and indirect factors,"" Vakil said. ""Direct factors include interest rate movements by the Federal Reserve. For example, if the Federal Reserve eases monetary policy by decreasing interest rates, then high dividend stocks become more attractive as interest rates fall."" Indirect factors would be broad economic or sector-specific changes that affect earnings and thus dividend payouts. For several decades, financial planners have suggested a4% to 4.7% withdrawal ratefrom portfolios‚Äîa target that's difficult to achieve through traditional dividend stocks alone without dipping into your principal. Created by Congress to encourage investment in middle-market businesses,BDCsare publicly traded entities sometimes called ""private equity for the common investor,"" providing financing to companies too large for bank loans but not yet ready for public markets. BDCs must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends, resulting in yields often ranging from 8% to 15%. Ares Capital (ARCC), the largest BDC with a $15 billion market cap, has a 9.5% yield (here and below, the last distribution as of April 2025) with a comparatively conservative portfolio primarily in senior secured loans. For higher potential returns, TriplePoint Venture Growth (TPVG) has a dividend yield above 20%, gained by financinggrowth-stagetechnology companies‚Äîthus, less likely to be stable. However, these impressive yields come with significant risks. BDCs can borrow up to $2 for every $1 they own, which can amplify losses when things go wrong. They lend to smaller businesses that are more likely to default during tough times, so dividends are likely to drop when the economy slows. Holding BDCs in tax-advantaged accounts, such asIRAs, can prove even more important than usual, as distributions are generally taxed as ordinary income rather than qualifying for preferred dividend tax rates. Midstream energy companies own and operate the pipelines, storage tanks, and processing facilities that move oil and natural gas from wells to refineries and then on to consumers. They're like the toll roads of the energy industry, collecting their fees regardless of energy prices. These companies are formed as master limited partnerships (MLPs), allowing them to gain the tax benefits of being a limited partnership while offering units (not shares) to the public. They yield between 4% and 8%. For example, Energy Transfer LP (ET) has a yield of 7.8%, while Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) has a yield of 7.1%. To instantly diversify your money across different companies in the sector, consider exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For example, the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) is a $10 billion fund that tracks the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index and has a dividend yield of 7.8%. The Global X MLP ETF (MLPA) has a yield of 7.3% while tracking the Solactive MLP Infrastructure Index. What makes midstream companies attractive is their steady cash flow from long-term contracts with built-in inflation adjustments. However, economic downturns can reduce energy demand, some companies carry significant debt, and many MLPs issue complex tax forms that can make tax preparation more challenging. You can solve this last problem by just holding these MLPs through an ETF. While traditional dividend stocks offer modest yields, there's a world of higher-income prospects for investors willing to explore less familiar territory. BDCs and midstream energy infrastructure MLPs are just two options for investments that have often paid out higher dividends. However, they have specific risks and tax implications that must be carefully weighed against your financial goals andrisk tolerance.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/your-dividend-yield-could-be-higher-11719459,4
2025-04-23 20:11:26,Watch These Bitcoin Price Levels as Key $100K Level Back in Striking Distance,"Bitcoin (BTCUSD) rose again Wednesday to bring the closely watched $100,000 mark back into striking distance. Thepioneer cryptocurrency, along with otherrisk-on assets, have rallied the past few days amid optimism that the White House could scale back itsplans on tariffsafter President Trump said the levy on China will be ""substantially"" below its current 145% level. Sentiment also received a boost after the presidentwalked back recent rhetoric about firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, shoring up confidence across financial markets that the central bank will retain its independence. While Bitcoin well below its record high of $109,000 set in January, it has risen about 25% from its 2025 low set in early April, as investors potentially turn to the cryptocurrency as an alternative to volatile stocks and aweakening U.S. dollar. Bitcoin was trading at $93,500 recently. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Bitcoin‚Äôs chart and point out major price levels that investors will likely be eyeing. Bitcoin oscillated within a four-monthfalling wedgebefore breaking out above the pattern earlier this month. Importantly, the price staged a decisive close above the closely watched200-day moving averagein Tuesday‚Äôs trading session, thoughvolumeswere lackluster. Meanwhile, therelative strength index (RSI)confirms bullish momentum with a reading above the 50 threshold, but remains belowoverboughtlevels, giving the price sufficient room to explore higher levels. Let‚Äôs identify two major overhead areas to watch amid the potential for further upside in bitcoin‚Äôs price and also point out keysupport levelsworth monitoring during retracements. Firstly, it‚Äôs worth keeping track of thepsychological$100,000 area. Bitcoin‚Äôs price could experience selling pressure at this major level near ahorizontal linethat connects an array ofprice actionon the chart between last November and late February. However, a close above this region could see the price make a move to around $107,000. Investors who have bought the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recentbreakoutmay decide tolock in profitsin this area near the prominent December and January peaks. This location also matches with a projected measured moveprice targetthat calculates the depth of falling wedge and adds that amount to the pattern‚Äôs breakout point. For example, adding $22,000 to $85,000 forecasts a target of $107,000. Selling in the cryptocurrency could see an initial retracement to around $85,000. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this area near this month‚Äôs breakout point, which also closely aligns with a range oftradingactivity on the chart stretching back to late February. Finally, a deeperpullbackopens the door for a retest of lower support at $76,000.

2025-04-23 22:02:51,The Fed's Next Move Is Coming Soon. Here's What to Expect for Mortgage Rates.,"The full article continues below these offers from our partners. At both its January and March meetings (there was no February meeting), theFederal Reserveannounced it was maintaining the federal funds rate at its current level. That paused a three-meeting run of rate cuts between September and December 2024, which had lowered the benchmark rate by a full percentage point. Previously, the Fed had held its key rate at a historic 23-year high for 14 months. Now, another Fed meeting is coming, with the central bank's rate-setting committee scheduled to announce its next decision on May 7. Though anything can happen in the next two weeks,CME Group's FedWatch Toolshows it's overwhelmingly predicted right now that the Fed will hold its benchmark rate steady. But there are five more Fed rate-setting meetings scheduled in 2025 after the May gathering, and according to year-end probabilities reported by the CME Group, traders are currently pricing in an almost 75% probability that cuts totaling at least 0.75 points will be announced by December 2025.Most likely, that would occur as three 0.25-point cuts, but the Fed could also choose to make a larger reduction at any meeting. As forwhenthe Fed's predicted rate reductions will arrive, markets are betting we'll be waiting at least a couple more months before the first cut of 2025. It's not until the Fed's June 17‚Äì18 meeting that the majority odds favor a quarter-point rate decrease. As we always caution, rate predictions far into the future should not be considered reliable, as the Fed makes each of its rate decisions meeting by meeting based on the latest economic data available. And that's especially true right now due to the possibility that the Trump administration's tariff policy will pushinflationrates higher. It's a common belief that when the Federal Reserve raises thefederal funds rate, as it did aggressively during 2022 and 2023, mortgage rates will climb. Conversely, the logic goes, when the Fed lowers the federal funds rate, it's expected that mortgage rates will fall. So, if the Fed reduces its benchmark rate later this year, can we expect mortgage rates to drop? Unfortunately, the relationship between the federal funds rate and what mortgage lenders offer is not quite so clear. Instead, moves by the central bank more directly impact short-term rates, such as those paid on bank accounts as well as those charged on credit card and personal loan balances. Since fixed mortgages offer the stability of a long-term rate, their connection to Fed rate changes is more tenuous. Beyond the federal funds rate, a tangle of economic factors affectsthe mortgage lending market. These include inflation, consumer demand, housing supply, the strength of the current economy, and the status of the bond market, especially that of10-year Treasury yields. Given these other influences, mortgage rates and the Fed funds rate can move independently‚Äîeven in opposite directions. That's exactly what we saw in the last quarter of 2024, when mortgage rates shot up despite a bold half-point rate cut in September. Not only that, but after two more Fed reductions, 30-year mortgage rates surged again in late December and January, reaching almost 1.25 percentage points higher than before the Fed's first rate cut. Fallout from President Trump's tariff policy put into effect on April 2 has also pushed mortgage rates around. Initially, the stock market dropped, sending bond yields lower. This caused a quick mortgage rate decline. But the massive uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and the trade wars they've ignited, later sent bond yields much higher,causing mortgage rates to surge. Since then, the 30-year mortgage rate average has again fallen and again climbed for an April roller coaster fueled bymarket uncertainties waiting to be resolved. So while the Fed is most likely to signal in May that it remains in ""wait and see"" mode, other swirling economic factors clearly have the power to dramatically impact mortgage rates even when the Fed is doing nothing to its benchmark rate. One especially important factor for bond yields‚Äîand therefore mortgage rates‚Äîis the future outlook for the Fed's benchmark rate. In other words, what'sexpectedto happen with the Fed rate is often more impactful to mortgage rates than where the federal funds rate sits right now. True, financial markets have assigned a majority probability that we'll see at least three rate cuts this year. But in today's economic and political environment‚Äîand the uncertainty over which tariffs will stick, which will be softened, which will turn into all-out trade wars‚Äînothing can be truly counted on right now. Inflation, for instance, could rise substantially, which in turn could scare the Fed off any rate cuts in the near term. For now, the Fed's expected rate hold in two weeks will likely do little, if anything, to the direction of mortgage rates. More impactful will be the status of tariff policy and the next round of inflation readings. Also useful will be the Federal Reserve's next official statement on where it expects its benchmark rate will be by the end of the year (its ""dot plot"" forecast). But since it releases that projection only quarterly, we'll be left waiting until the June 17‚Äì18 meeting to see behind that curtain.

She added that demand signals from business leaders remain strong. ServiceNow shares rose more than 10% in after-hours trading to about $898. Below, we take a closer look at Service Now‚Äôs chart and applytechnical analysisto identify crucial post-earnings price levels worth watching out for. Since completing adouble topin late January, ServiceNow shares trended lower within adescending channelfor several months before breaking out above the pattern‚Äôs upper trendline on Wednesday, setting the stage for a bullish trendreversal. Importantly, therelative strength index (RSI)confirms bullish momentum, though the indicator remains well belowoverboughtlevels, giving the stock ample room to climb. Let‚Äôs identify three crucial overhead areas on ServiceNow‚Äôs chart worth watching and also point out an importantsupport levelto eye duringpullbacks. The first higher level to watch sits around $900. The shares could encounter overheadresistancein this area near a trendline that connects a range of comparableprice actionon the chart extending back to last September. A convincing close above this level may fuel a move to the psychological $1,000 level. Investors who have purchased shares at lower prices could look forprofit-takingopportunities in this region near the mid-Februarycountertrendpeak, an area that closely aligns with a minorretracementin the stock last November. Further buying could underpin a move up to $1,160. This area on the chart would likely attract considerable attention near the prominent December and Januarypeaksthat marked the stock‚Äôs double top. Finally, a loss of upside earnings-driven momentum could see ServiceNow shares retrace to around $807. However, investors would likely view this area as a high-probabilityentry pointnear the initialbreakoutlocation, which also lines up with several peaks and troughs on the chart stretching back to July last year.

2025-04-24 13:30:00,Five Market Insights: Why Industry Leaders Prioritize Digital Reputation,"Darius Fisher is cofounder and CEO of Status Labs, a leading authority in digital reputation strategy.   getty  The importance of a brand‚Äôs digital reputation cannot be overstated. A solid digital reputation is essential for driving revenue, building investor trust and maintaining competitive advantage.  As CEO of a company that specializes in digital reputation strategy, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how a brand‚Äôs online presence and reputation can make or break each facet of business, from consumer loyalty to market valuation. Here are five market insights that illustrate why Fortune 100 and other elite brands place digital reputation management at the core of their strategy.  1. Reputation risk is financial risk. For public companies, reputation is a financial asset. A strong digital presence can impact the bottom line through improved stock performance, lower capital costs and higher brand loyalty. Conversely, reputational damage can erode shareholder value.   According to PwC‚Äôs 2023 Global Crisis and Resilience Survey, 89% of companies identified resilience as one of their most important strategic priorities, and 70% said they feel confident in their ability to respond to disruption. Still, many organizations lack the foundational elements needed for resilience. Typically, the more valuable a company, the bigger the stakes: Even a single reputational misstep can cost a company millions. 2. Reputation drives capital attraction. Reputation plays a central role in attracting and retaining investor interest. A 2024 report by Echo Research found that reputation contributes to 28% of the market capitalization across the S&P 500, amounting to approximately $11.9 trillion in value. That same report found that tech giants like Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet and more ‚Äúderive half or close to half their value from the confidence inspired by their corporate reputations.‚Äù The reputations of a company‚Äôs leadership and brand are often inextricably linked, influencing how investment communities perceive a company‚Äôs stability and growth potential.  Investors today are not just looking at quarterly earnings, of course. They‚Äôre scrutinizing a company‚Äôs online footprint, executive social media presence and how it responds to public issues. A trusted reputation translates to reduced investment risk. Research shows that authentic leadership‚Äîmarked by transparency, ethics and consistency‚Äîcan increase employee trust and engagement, making employees more likely to stay loyal to their organization and aligned with its values.  3. SEO and digital PR strategies amplify corporate messaging and help control the narrative. For any brand, especially industry leaders, organic search results and digital press are invaluable tools in shaping public perception. Solid search engine optimization and digital public relations strategies enable companies to control their narrative and amplify their messaging, while also mitigating the impact of potential negative press. Unlike paid ads, organic SEO builds long-term credibility, pushing positive stories and company-authored content to the forefront of search results.   When an executive team commits to proactive digital PR and SEO strategies, they can bolster credibility and help ensure that a brand‚Äôs positive values and achievements are prominent and accessible. 4. Crisis management preparedness shields against public backlash. High-profile companies and executives are often vulnerable to crises fueled by misinformation, social media and rapid news cycles. As shown in PwC‚Äôs 2023 Global Crisis and Resilience Survey, many organizations still lack the integrated programs and leadership accountability required to manage disruption effectively. This gap can often lead to significant financial and reputational setbacks. Many Fortune 100 companies, therefore, prioritize reputation management as a critical layer of crisis preparedness. A comprehensive crisis management plan isn‚Äôt reactive; it‚Äôs proactive, establishing systems to monitor, address and neutralize emerging risks before they snowball into full-blown crises. Industry leaders understand that quick, transparent action in the face of controversy is often the difference between a reputational crisis that is managed and one that spirals. 5. Employee trust is built through consistent digital reputation management. For top-performing companies, reputation management is more than just an external practice; it‚Äôs a cornerstone of internal culture as well. When a company‚Äôs reputation is strong, employees feel pride and trust in their organization, which can lead to higher morale and productivity. This is particularly important for attracting and retaining top talent‚Äîmany potential hires now research a company‚Äôs digital presence and reputation as part of their decision making process. By investing in a proactive, values-driven digital reputation, companies can protect their brand externally while also creating a sense of unity and purpose internally. What should leaders be thinking about when it comes to their company‚Äôs digital reputation? First, establish a clear system to monitor brand-related content across search, social and AI-generated platforms. Companies should regularly audit their top search results, Wikipedia presence and emerging LLM-generated summaries (like those produced by ChatGPT) to ensure their story is accurate and values-aligned. Second, make digital reputation strategy an integrated, cross-functional priority. That means not just PR and marketing, but also legal, HR, investor relations and the C-suite should be aligned on messaging and response frameworks. What common challenges do companies face? Many companies fall into the trap of reacting only during a crisis. Others rely too heavily on paid media while neglecting organic reputation building. In today‚Äôs landscape, AI-driven tools can amplify inaccurate or outdated information at scale‚Äîmaking it critical to manage what gets indexed and shared. I've found the brands that succeed are the ones that think long-term, invest in credibility and lead with transparency. Digital reputation is a core asset for industry leaders. Digital reputation management is a strategic imperative that can directly influence financial health, investor relations and internal culture. The stakes are high, and maintaining a resilient, trusted online presence is critical to both short-term performance and long-term legacy. In today‚Äôs reputation-driven economy, companies that manage their digital presence with purpose and foresight can stand out‚Äîand ultimately, that trust is invaluable.

2025-04-24 13:49:58,How Much Is the Average Inheritance? It's More Than You Might Think,"The average inheritance for American households is $46,200, according to the Federal Reserve.This number is as high as it is because of the large inheritances passed down by wealthy families to their heirs. So, what should you do withan inheritance? And what do you need to know about the related taxes? Give yourself a savings cushion by using your inheritance to fund anemergency fund. You'll also want to pay down any debt that carries a high-interest rate. Daniel Masuda Lehrman, a certified financial planner and owner of Masuda Lehrman Wealth, recommends a cash inheritance be used to pay off high-interest deby to to beef up your emergency funds. He recommends keeping 6 to 12 months' worth of expenses in ahigh-yield savings account. ""Your emergency fund is your life preserver as you set sail on your retirement journey,"" said Lehrman.¬†""It not only helps you sleep better through volatile times, but it prevents you from taking withdrawals from your investments while the market is down."" Putting aside money for the future is another good use of your inheritance, for instance, consider adding to your retirement savings. ""Once your cash reserve is solid and that high-interest debt is behind you, think about investing,"" advisesBrandon Gibson, a wealth manager at Gibson Wealth Management. Gibson recommends consideringa Roth IRA. ""Since the money grows tax-free, you typically want to invest it in something with long-term growth potential‚Äîusually a diversified mix of global stocks. The earlier you start, the more time that money has to grow."" You can have some fun with your inheritance, once all the essential bases are covered. You might take the time to treat yourself to a special vacation or purchase, or even just a night out. Do it all in honor of the loved one who has passed away. ""After paying off high-interest rate debt, I would recommend earmarking a few thousand for a vacation or for buying something special,"" saysChris Diodato, a certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning. He says that honoring your loved ones should be a consideration, apart from the financial concerns. ""This helps, in my opinion, honor the decedent by creating a special memory or having a special asset that can always be associated with them.¬†At the same time, it lets the inheritor be human and enjoy some of the funds."" In 2025, there is no estate tax on estates of $13.99 million or less. This is an increase from $13.61 million in 2024. Use your inheritance to give to causes close to a loved one's heart. You'll feel closer to them by doing so. ""Consider what would honor the relative. Were they all about education? They might love it if you invested this into a529 accountfor the next generation. Did they love a particular hiking trail? It might honor them to place a bench with a commemorative plaque remembering them. Did they have a soft spot for people down on their luck? Consider donating to the local food bank,"" saysSamantha Mockford, a certified financial planner at Citrine Capital Advisors. Use the inherited money to do something you always wanted to do but thought you couldn't afford. ""Consider using it to build a better future for yourself, potentially turning an inheritance into a life-changing event,"" says Noah Damsky, a principal atMarina Wealth Advisors. ""You can invest in yourself by going back to school, saving for a down¬†payment on a home, or planning a wedding."" Most people won't have to deal with a federalestate tax. ""The average American also does not need to worry about federal inheritance/estate taxes, as there is an exemption for estates valued at less than $13.99 million,"" Diodato advises.¬†""Some individual states do, however, have their own inheritance taxes."" States withinheritance taxesinclude Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. ¬†These states have inheritance taxes ranging from 1% to 16%. If you live in one of these states and get a big inheritance, you may wish to reach out to a financial advisor or a tax advisor for advice. If you receive an inheritance when a loved one passes away, you'll want to use the money wisely. Begin by looking at what is not working in your finances, such as paying high-interest debt. This inherited money is your opportunity to clear out that debt once and for all. You'll also want to take a look at your savings. If there is not much there, the next step is setting aside six to 12 months of savings in anemergency fund. Next, think about the future and your retirement. Your inheritance allows you to jumpstart your retirement savings, so put aside a healthy amount for your retirement. Doing something special with the money, such as a vacation or even a purchase, is a nice thing to consider, and so is doing something to honor the person who passed away by donating to causes they held dear.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/average-american-inheritance-11703901,3

2025-04-24 14:26:00,Google Earnings Will Be Biggest Q1 Report Yet As Investors Search For Tariff And Recession Impacts,"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the ""closest thing to impossible"" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst.VCG via Getty Images  Key Facts   Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet.    That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year.    Alphabet‚Äôs bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion.    Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks.   The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21.     Google Mum On Tariffs In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to ‚Äúspeculate about potential impacts‚Äù of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will ‚Äúobviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from‚Äù Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a ‚Äúnegative tariff ad spend impact,‚Äù according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump‚Äôs more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has ‚Äúrelatively less‚Äù pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google‚Äôs revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google‚Äôs top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Google Stock Bounced Before Earnings As Nasdaq Jumped 2% Shares of Google rose during Thursday‚Äôs regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That‚Äôs the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq‚Äôs 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump‚Äôs trade war broadly ate into investor confidence.  Crucial Quote ‚ÄúIf investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,‚Äù Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a ‚Äúlibrary of regulatory overhangs‚Äù and a ‚Äúpotential lightning rod for international retaliation‚Äù against American entities, explained Shmulik. Tangent Among the ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Key Background Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla to form the ‚Äúmagnificent seven‚Äù).

2025-04-24 15:10:41,The Little-Known Retirement Plan the Wealthy Swear By,"Cash balance pensions have seen significant growth over the past two decades, with their numbers increasing 15-fold and now accounting for nearly 50% of all defined benefit plans.Unlike traditional pensions or 401(k) plans, they offer a unique blend of features that make them an appealing choice for those seeking to build wealth. Understanding how they work and how they differ from other retirement plans can help you leverage their potential to boost your long-term wealth. Acash balance pensionis a type ofdefined benefit planwhere the employer makes annual contributions to an individual‚Äôs account based on a set percentage of their salary. Compared totraditional pension plans, which pay a fixed benefit based on factors like years of service and salary at retirement, cash balance pension works more like a401(k)but with guaranteed returns. In addition to the employer contributions, known as pay credits, the account balance also grows through interest credits, which are based on a predetermined interest rate, either fixed or tied to the market index, ensuring the employees‚Äô balance increases each year. ‚ÄúThink of a cash balance pension plan as a mix between a traditional pension and a 401(k),‚Äù saysNadia Vanderhall, financial planner and founder of The Brands and Bands Strategy Group. ‚ÄúA¬†cash balance plan¬†gives you a set amount added to your account every year (like a deposit and interest), but it‚Äôs technically a¬†pension‚Äîyour job funds it, not you.You don‚Äôt have to pick investments, and the money grows at a set interest rate the plan guarantees.‚Äù With each passing year, the combination of pay credits and interest credits ensures a reliable and predictable increase in your account balance. To calculate your pay credit: Pay Credit = Employee Salary √ó Pay Credit Percentage To calculate your interest credit: Interest Credit = Account Balance √ó Interest Rate Let‚Äôs say you participate in a cash balance pension plan at your company, receiving a pay credit percentage of 5% and an interest rate of 4%. If you earn $120,000, you will receive a pay credit of $6,000. With the 4% interest rate, the interest credit will be $240, bringing the account balance to $6,240. Keep in mind that the contribution amount can increase based on factors such as pay raises, higher employer contribution rates, or adjustments based on your age to accelerate savings as you approach retirement. Once you retire, you can choose between receiving alump sumpayment and converting the balance into a monthlyannuity. However, if you change jobs before retiring, this impacts your options. ‚ÄúThe plan doesn‚Äôt move with you the same way a 401(k) does. It‚Äôll usually be rolled over into anIRA, and the structure changes. If you‚Äôre switching jobs or making major business moves, talk to a financial pro to figure out the best way to roll it over without losing any tax benefits or momentum,‚Äù Vanderhall recommends. Whether you‚Äôre a high-income earner, business owner, or simply planning ahead, a cash balance pension plan can help you buildwealthefficiently and predictably. Here‚Äôs how: Guaranteed Growth: Cash balance pension plans provide consistent, predictable growth through interest credits, offering a stable return without the fluctuations of the stock market. Flexible Contribution Limits: The contribution limits for cash balance pension plans vary based on your salary, age, and target balance. Unlike IRAs and 401(k)s, which are subject to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) contribution limits, this plan offers more flexibility tailored to your financial situation.‚ÄúYou can stash away way more money than you could in a 401(k) alone‚Äîsometimes even hundreds of thousands per year, depending on your age andincome,‚Äù Vanderhall says. Tax-Deferred Growth: Contributions aretax deferred, meaning you don‚Äôt pay taxes until you withdraw funds. At the time of withdrawal, yourtax bracketwill influence how much you pay in taxes, so if you‚Äôre in a lower tax bracket, you‚Äôll pay less. Before jumping into a cash balance pension plan, it‚Äôs important to understand that while these plans offer some serious wealth-building advantages, they‚Äôre not for everyone. ‚ÄúThese plans can bepowerfulfor folks who are high earners or small business owners to better help them position the actual planning of their retirement, especially those who started saving for retirement later in life (it happens), want to catch up quickly, or have already maxed out a 401(k) or IRA, but still want to build,‚Äù Vanderhall says. In other words, if you‚Äôre behind on retirement or have extra income you‚Äôre looking to shelter from taxes, this type of plan can give you space to accelerate your savings in a big way. But it‚Äôs important to also consider the cost of setting up this plan. ‚ÄúThey can be pricey to set up and run, especially for small businesses,‚Äù Vanderhall says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking admin fees, actuaries, annual filings‚Äîthe whole nine. If you‚Äôre self-employed or running a small business, work with a tax pro or financial planner who knows how to structure a cash balance plan alongside a 401(k). That combo can help lower overall costs and give you flexibility. You can also start with just the 401(k) and layer the cash balance plan on later when your income is more predictable.‚Äù There are also expectations for the annual contribution to consider. Since defined benefit plans like these require consistent contributions, planning ahead ensures you keep up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre usually locked into making contributions every year. That commitment can be a lot if your income isn‚Äôt steady,‚Äù Vanderhall says. ‚ÄúBuild a buffer into your cash flow or business budget, so you‚Äôre not scrambling to fund the plan each year. A profit-first or quarterly savings strategy can help cover contributions consistently.‚Äù Cash balance pension plans offer a powerful way to build wealth for retirement. They are an increasingly popular choice for those looking for stability and steady growth. While they differ from traditionalretirement savingsoptions, they provide a unique opportunity for employees to accumulate retirement savings with minimal investment risks.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/the-little-known-retirement-plan-the-wealthy-swear-by-11701012,4
2025-04-24 15:16:34,An Apple Bull Trimmed Its Price Target on the Stock Today. Here's Why.,"One of Wall Street's Apple bulls pared their optimism on the tech giant's shares today. Bank of America analysts on Thursday maintained their ""buy"" rating on Apple (AAPL) stock, but they also trimmed their price target by $10, lowering it to $240. (That's still above the Street's mean near $234, according to Visible Alpha.) Their reasons: tariff-related costs that could weigh on margins, along with concerns thatdelayed AI featurescould dent device demand. The stock, meanwhile, was ticking higher as broader markets rose. Apple's shares were recently up 0.6% to above $205. Apple is set to join the parade ofMagnificent Seventech companies to report earnings, with its next set of results due next Thursday after the closing bell. Bank of America expects some tariff-driven ""pull forward"" to have helped lift sales during the most recent quarter, but they're cutting longer-term sales estimates ""to adjust for higher costs of navigating a more complex supply chain and for delays in launching an AI enabled Siri."" Apple's shares are down about 18% so far this year, underperforming the benchmarkS&P 500. Research firm Vanda earlier this week noted recent net selling of Apple by retail investors even as net buying continued elsewhere‚Äîsuch as shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA).

2025-04-24 20:00:31,5 Top Stocks To Buy Now For May 2025,"These picks diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services, and are ... More anchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models.getty The market landscape in early May 2025 is characterized by uncertainty and fragmentation, driven by a volatile combination of geopolitical instability, shifting sector dynamics and policy unpredictability. Economic rifts have deepened in recent weeks, driven in part by an unclear tariff framework and a lack of cohesive economic direction from both the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. With inflation pressures unresolved and confidence in long-term policy planning waning, investors are navigating a fragile environment where resilience is just as important as opportunity.   This article highlights five standout investment opportunities for the current market climate. The list features a balanced mix of growth-oriented innovators that have seen recent corrections, alongside dependable dividend-paying leaders with strong balance sheets and defensible business models. In an era marked by dislocation and doubt, each of these companies offers a compelling case built on financial durability, competitive edge and potential catalysts poised to reward patient investors.  How These Top Stock Picks Were Chosen This selection process balances fundamentals, technicals and macro context. For growth stocks, we focused on industry leaders with strong business models that have pulled back on sentiment, rather than fundamentals, offering attractive long-term entry points. Defensive picks emphasize dividend strength, valuation discipline and resilience across cycles. Each name was vetted for cash flow, balance sheet health and near-term catalysts. The result: a portfolio built for both upside and protection in an uncertain 2025 market.   5 Top Stocks To Buy Now In May 2025 1. Tesla (TSLA) Tesla Business Overview Tesla has evolved from a pure electric vehicle manufacturer into a comprehensive company focused on sustainable energy and artificial intelligence. While its automotive division continues to produce the Models 3, Y, S and the recently launched Cybertruck, as well as the $28,000 Model 2, Tesla has diversified into energy generation and storage with its Solar Roof, Powerwall and utility-scale battery installations. The company's vertical integration spans battery production through the Gigafactories, autonomous driving capabilities via its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and an expanding services ecosystem. Tesla's AI initiatives have accelerated following the commercial launch of its Optimus humanoid robot and Dojo supercomputer applications.  MORE FOR YOUDOGE-Trolling Ransomware Hackers Demand $1 Trillion In Chilling AttackGoogle Confirms Gmail Update‚ÄîHow To Keep Your Email AccountGoogle Starts Scanning Your Photos‚Äî3 Billion Users Must Now Decide  The company maintains production facilities across four continents, with its newest Gigafactory in Indonesia having broken ground in late 2024. Despite facing intensifying competition in the electric vehicle (EV) space, particularly from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers' electric offerings, Tesla maintains significant advantages in manufacturing efficiency, battery technology and software capabilities. CEO Elon Musk's recent reorganizational efforts have focused on streamlining operations and accelerating the company's artificial intelligence and robotics divisions while maintaining automotive innovation. Why TSLA Stock Is A Top Choice The decline follows multiple headwinds: lower-than-expected Q1 deliveries, intensifying global EV price competition, and delays in the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service. Compounding these challenges is growing investor unease over Elon Musk‚Äôs political behavior and public promotion of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which many view as symbolic of his broader attempts to undermine government institutions. This has alienated a significant segment of the political left, including many upper-middle-class Democrats (Tesla‚Äôs core market), who increasingly distrust Musk and his leadership team. His involvement in multiple non-core ventures, including X (formerly Twitter) and other business interests, has further fueled concerns about diminished focus during a pivotal period for Tesla‚Äôs operational performance.  Tesla‚Äôs Q1 2025 earnings report, released April 22, underscored these concerns. The company missed Wall Street expectations on both revenue and profit, with automotive revenue plunging 20% year-over-year to $14 billion. Total revenue declined 9%, and net income dropped 71% from the prior year. Tesla cited factory upgrades, lower average selling prices, and incentives as key drags. The company also refrained from reaffirming its 2025 growth guidance, instead postponing updates until Q2. Despite this, shares saw a slight after-hours rebound following President Trump‚Äôs reassurance on Fed leadership‚Äîa sign of the stock‚Äôs continued political sensitivity.   Yet not all is bleak. Tesla‚Äôs energy storage segment grew 67% year-over-year, and the company confirmed it remains on track to pilot both its robotaxi service in Austin and humanoid robot production in Fremont later this year. Meanwhile, the launch of its affordable Model 2 and the ongoing expansion of AI and Dojo infrastructure offer long-term upside. With $26.3 billion in cash and around $13 billion in debt, Tesla maintains the financial flexibility to navigate short-term challenges. For investors with a long horizon, the recent selloff may offer an entry point‚Äîalbeit one that now demands careful monitoring of political, regulatory, and operational risks. 2. NVIDIA (NVDA) NVIDIA Business Overview NVIDIA has evolved from a gaming graphics card company into the world's leading provider of computing platforms for artificial intelligence and accelerated computing applications. The company's GPU technology has become the foundation of the AI revolution, with its data center segment now representing over 65% of total revenue. NVIDIA's hardware offerings span the entire computing spectrum, from GeForce gaming GPUs and workstation-class Quadro cards to data center-focused Hopper and Blackwell architectures. The company has expanded its reach beyond hardware through CUDA, its parallel computing platform, and an evolving software ecosystem that encompasses AI frameworks, digital twin simulations and enterprise solutions. In recent quarters, NVIDIA has accelerated its system integration efforts, introducing pre-configured AI systems, such as the DGX SuperPOD, as well as specialized solutions for various industries, including healthcare and telecommunications. The company's collaboration with leading cloud service providers has expanded, with specialized instances featuring NVIDIA's latest GPU architectures available across all major platforms. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's automotive computing platform continues gaining traction with automakers pursuing advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving capabilities, creating another growth vector beyond its core markets. Why NVDA Stock Is A Top Choice NVIDIA has pulled back more than 30% from its highs, but strong fundamentals and expanding markets make the dip a compelling opportunity. In its latest report, revenue surged 122% YoY with rising margins, countering fears of AI saturation or chip oversupply. With its next-gen Blackwell architecture launching in Q2 2025, NVIDIA is set to lead the next wave of AI infrastructure. Its edge lies in both cutting-edge hardware and a dominant software ecosystem that locks in customers and pricing power. Despite export-related headwinds, its strategic role in U.S. tech leadership remains intact. With projected earnings growth of over 40% through 2027 and rising shareholder returns, NVIDIA continues to offer a rare opportunity for long-term upside. 3. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson Business Overview Johnson & Johnson remains a global healthcare leader following its strategic transformation through the Kenvue consumer health spinoff, completed in 2023. The streamlined company now focuses exclusively on its pharmaceutical and medical device segments, which together represent cutting-edge healthcare innovation and stable, recession-resistant revenue streams. J&J's pharmaceutical division boasts a robust portfolio of treatments across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and cardiovascular health, including blockbuster drugs such as Stelara, Darzalex and Tremfya. Its medical device segment provides essential surgical instruments, orthopedic implants, vision care products and interventional solutions. The company's research and development capabilities remain industry-leading, with an annual R&D investment exceeding $15 billion and a pipeline featuring over 100 clinical development programs. J&J's acquisition strategy has been disciplined yet opportunistic, with recent purchases strengthening its capabilities in robotic surgery, cardiovascular devices and cell therapy platforms. Following the resolution of major talc litigation through its controversial Texas Two-Step bankruptcy strategy in late 2024, the company has reduced a significant overhang that had suppressed shareholder value for years. Why JNJ Stock Is A Top Choice Johnson & Johnson blends defensive stability with meaningful growth potential‚Äîideal for today‚Äôs uncertain market. Backed by 63 straight years of dividend increases and a 3.2% yield, JNJ generates strong cash flow and trades at a modest 14.8x forward earnings. Growth drivers include a robust pharmaceutical pipeline (targeting $15B in new revenue by 2028), expansion in oncology and cell therapy, and a rebound in elective procedures. Its Ottava robotic surgery platform just gained FDA approval. With $19 billion in net cash, JNJ has the flexibility for acquisitions, buybacks, or further dividend hikes, making it a rare combination of resilience and upside. 4. Procter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Business Overview Procter & Gamble maintains its position as the world's premier consumer packaged goods company, with an unparalleled portfolio of essential household brands across categories including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric care, home care and baby care. The company's flagship brands‚Äîincluding Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Crest, Charmin and Dawn‚Äîhold leading market positions in their respective segments across more than 180 countries. The company's operational excellence initiative, launched in 2023, has generated approximately $2.1 billion in annual cost savings through the implementation of manufacturing automation, supply chain optimization and digital transformation. These efficiencies have enabled P&G to navigate inflationary pressures while continuing to invest in product innovation and marketing effectiveness. Why PG Stock Is A Top Choice Procter & Gamble is a strong defensive play for 2025, backed by essential products, pricing power and a history of consistent performance. With 5.2% organic sales growth, 33% of sales from emerging markets, and 18% from e-commerce, P&G continues to expand through premiumization and innovation. Financially, it‚Äôs disciplined, with 68 consecutive years of dividend increases and steady buybacks. Recent gains in the fabric care, health, and home categories demonstrate resilience in the face of intense competition. For investors seeking stability, income, and moderate growth, P&G remains a reliable cornerstone. 5. Waste Management (WM) Waste Management Business Overview Waste Management is North America's largest environmental services provider, serving over 21 million customers across municipal, commercial and residential sectors. Its vast network ‚Äî spanning over 500 collection sites, 260 landfills and 140 recycling facilities‚Äîcreates high barriers to entry and drives efficiency through vertical integration and dense routing. The company has strategically expanded its sustainability initiatives, positioning itself as both a waste collector and a materials management company, with a focus on extracting maximum value from waste streams. WM's recycling operations process nearly 12 million tons of materials annually, while its renewable energy projects generate enough electricity to power more than 600,000 homes. The company's recent strategic acquisitions, including the $4.6 billion purchase of Stericycle, completed in January 2025, have strengthened its position in specialized, higher-margin waste streams such as medical, hazardous and industrial waste, complementing its core municipal solid waste business. Why WM Stock Is A Top Choice Waste Management offers a rare blend of recession-resistant stability and growth potential. With ~70% of revenue from long-term contracts tied to inflation, WM enjoys steady cash flow and strong pricing power. Operational efficiency gains have expanded EBITDA margins by 180 bps since 2023, providing downside protection. But WM isn‚Äôt just defensive‚Äîit‚Äôs growing. Renewable natural gas projects, the Stericycle acquisition and improved recycling margins are driving revenue and diversification. With rising free cash flow, a 10% dividend increase in Q1 2025 and ongoing buybacks, WM delivers income, growth and environmental impact, setting it apart from traditional utilities. Bottom Line The five highlighted stocks‚ÄîTesla, NVIDIA, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Waste Management‚Äîoffer a balanced approach for navigating the market challenges of May 2025. Tesla and NVIDIA offer growth potential following sharp pullbacks, while J&J, P&G and Waste Management provide defensive stability and income. Together, they diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services‚Äîanchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models. Read Next  VEU Vs.

2025-04-24 20:06:45,Google Earnings Stock Soars As Q1 Results Shatter Expectations,"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the ""closest thing to impossible"" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst.VCG via Getty Images  Key Facts   Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet.    That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year.    Alphabet‚Äôs bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion.    Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks.   The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21.     Google Mum On Tariffs In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to ‚Äúspeculate about potential impacts‚Äù of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will ‚Äúobviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from‚Äù Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a ‚Äúnegative tariff ad spend impact,‚Äù according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump‚Äôs more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has ‚Äúrelatively less‚Äù pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google‚Äôs revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google‚Äôs top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Google Stock Bounced Before Earnings As Nasdaq Jumped 2% Shares of Google rose during Thursday‚Äôs regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That‚Äôs the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq‚Äôs 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump‚Äôs trade war broadly ate into investor confidence.  Crucial Quote ‚ÄúIf investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,‚Äù Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a ‚Äúlibrary of regulatory overhangs‚Äù and a ‚Äúpotential lightning rod for international retaliation‚Äù against American entities, explained Shmulik. Tangent Among the ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Key Background Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla to form the ‚Äúmagnificent seven‚Äù). Google was a key part of the massive tech stock rally as generative AI‚Äôs popularity spiked, as its share price more than doubled from the end of 2022 to 2024. But big tech has stalled on Wall Street as recession fears escalated, as Bloomberg‚Äôs magnificent seven index has declined about 20% in 2025.  What To Watch For Next week, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will all report earnings from 2025‚Äôs first three months. Tesla, the least valuable member of the magnificent seven, shared its Q1 report Tuesday, missing on both profit and revenue forecasts.

2025-04-24 20:11:00,Why Broadcom Stock Soared Today,"Broadcom(AVGO6.33%)stock rose 6.3% in Thursday's trading. Investors were sunny on the stock after a supplier of memory chips published quarterly results that point to demand remaining strong for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The stock is also getting a boost from bullish momentum for the broader market. Before the market opened today,SK Hynixpublished its first-quarter results, and the information could be great news for Broadcom. SK Hynix is South Korea-based designer of memory chips, and it's recent Q1 report suggests strong demand in the AI hardware space. SK Hynix reported substantial sales and earnings beats driven by strong demand for its high-bandwidth-memory (HBM) solutions. Crucially, HBM chips are used byNvidiaand other AI processor designers. Hynix's results seem to suggest that Nvidia has continued to spend heavily on HBM chips. In turn, this makes it more likely that large data center customers have continued to spend heavily on the kind of networking hardware technologies and services that Broadcom provides. Trade war concerns have been a major source of volatility for tech valuations lately, but investors have been buying back into stocks this week on indications that the U.S. is taking an active approach to mitigating some major sources of fear and uncertainty. Even though Chinese officials said yesterday that there were currently no active trade negotiations with the U.S., comments from Trump administration officials seemingly point to a desire to get a deal done. Meanwhile, some reports suggest that the U.S. and India are close to reaching preliminary terms on a bilateral trade agreement. Signs of de-escalation on the trade war front could continue to be a bullish catalyst for Broadcom, but investors should understand that the situation is still shifting rapidly -- and more volatility could be on the horizon.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/24/why-broadcom-stock-soared-today/?.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-24 20:18:42,"Tech stocks climb as Nvidia, Amazon reject claims of AI buildout slowdown","Investing.com -- Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose 3.2% and 3% respectively Thursday after executives from both companies pushed back on reports suggesting a slowdown in artificial intelligence infrastructure spending. Speaking at a conference reported on by CNBC, the companies said demand for compute power and data center capacity remains strong, directly addressing recent concerns from investors. Kevin Miller, Amazon‚Äôs vice president of global data centers, acknowledged that speculation about paused leasing had generated noise in the market but insisted the company‚Äôs outlook was unchanged. He told the audience there had been ‚Äúno significant change‚Äù to data center plans, and criticized what he called ‚Äútea leaf reading‚Äù of Amazon‚Äôs long-term strategy. Nvidia‚Äôs senior director of corporate sustainability, Josh Parker, echoed Miller‚Äôs comments, stating the chipmaker has not observed any reduction in demand for AI-related compute power. He downplayed industry concerns that a new model from Chinese AI firm DeepSeek would slash energy needs, characterizing that reaction as a ‚Äúkneejerk.‚Äù Much of the discussion centered not just on data center construction, but the massive energy capacity required to support AI at scale. Anthropic‚Äôs co-founder Jack Clark projected that 50 gigawatts of new power generation, the equivalent of 50 nuclear reactors, will be needed by 2027 as AI adoption grows. At the Hamm Institute for American Energy conference in Oklahoma City, executives from tech and energy firms pointed toward natural gas as a viable backbone for meeting surging electricity needs. With AI systems expanding rapidly, the convergence of these industries is becoming increasingly visible. Despite reports earlier in the week, including by Wells Fargo analysts citing AWS leasing slowdowns, Amazon and Nvidia delivered a unified message: demand isn‚Äôt slowing... and neither are their plans. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking both in the next couple years as well as long term and seeing the numbers only going up,‚Äù Miller said, reinforcing Amazon‚Äôs ongoing investment trajectory.

Although Trump administration officials have offered mixed comments on trade policy, this week's rally has coincided with increased optimism that negotiations couldresult in lower tariffs. The S&P 500 advanced 2.0%, while the Dow ended 1.2% higher. Strength in the tech sector helped boost the Nasdaq, which soared 2.7%. ServiceNow shares (NOW) jumped 15.5%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500, after the cloud-based enterprise software firm topped sales and profit forecastswith its first-quarter results. ServiceNow indicated that tariffs, trade negotiations, and government efficiency efforts represent an opportunity, rather than a headwind, for its products designed to help organizations automate and modernize their processes. Hasbro (HAS) reportedbetter-than-expected sales and profitsfor the first quarter, and shares of the toymaker surged 14.6%. The home to brands like Nerf and Play-Doh also maintained its full-year guidance, despite uncertainties about the potential impact of tariffs. In addition, Hasbro announced an extension of its licensing deal with Disney (DIS), meaning the company will continue producing toys for the entertainment giant's popular franchises such as Marvel and Star Wars.

Microchip's new product aims to boost efficiency and minimize power loss with a compact solution that requires less board space. Microchip shares advanced 12.4% on Thursday. Shares of financial technology firm Fiserv (FI) plunged 18.5%, suffering the steepest drop of any S&P 500 constituent, following a mixed quarterly earnings report. Although profits topped expectations, revenue fell short of forecasts, reflecting slower growth in the company's Clover point-of-sale business and lower payment processing activity in its merchant solutions segment. Fiserv also announced an agreement to acquire Brazilian fintech firm Money Money, aiming to supplement Clover's operations by providing financing to small businesses in the country. Auto parts provider LKQ (LKQ) also missed quarterly sales estimates, and its shares skidded 11.6%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were down year-over-year, and LKQ reported negative free cash flow (FCF) during the period. Although the company left its guidance unchanged, it is monitoring possible tariff impacts, indicating that it formed a dedicated task force to evaluate potential challenges and opportunities related to the shifting global trade environment.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other aggressive growth stocks. US stocks delivered a positive performance on Wednesday, April 23, after President Trump pointed out that he does not intend to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This statement helped ease Wall Street‚Äôs fears about the independence of the central bank. Additionally, Trump softened his tone on tariffs and hinted that the high duties on Chinese imports could be scaled back in the future.

The S&P 500 rose nearly 1.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased about 1.1%, or 400 points. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq was up over 4% at one point and the Dow had added about 1,100 points. However, these gains faded after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters there has been ‚Äúno unilateral offer from the president to deescalate‚Äù the trade war with China. Despite this pullback, Wall Street remained optimistic because of President Trump‚Äôs softer tone on both the Fed and tariffs. On Tuesday, Trump said he expects China tariffs to come down significantly after Bessent had called the current tariffs ‚Äúunsustainable.‚Äù Trump also told reporters from the Oval Office that he never intended to remove Powell but repeated his desire for the Fed chair to lower interest rates. These comments brought relief to investors who had feared that a possible conflict between President Trump and Powell could add further uncertainty in a market that is already affected by tariffs.

2025-04-24 22:04:20,"Stocks Haven't Been Pricing in a U.S. Recession, Says Deutsche Bank","Analysts say the risk of a U.S. recession hasincreased this year, but investors are hoping America can weather the storm of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Stock, bond, and oil markets have all been battered by tariff uncertainty, but they're still in better shape than during recent recessions, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen. ""So markets clearly don‚Äôt see a recession as inevitable, particularly if the tariffs don‚Äôt come into force after the latest90-day extension,"" wrote Allen in a note on Wednesday. When stocks sold off in the wake of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariff announcement, the S&P 500 declined as much as 18.9%. It was one of the sharpest pullbacks in decades, but it was shallower than the declines that preceded each of America‚Äôs five mostrecent recessions. Credit spreadshave widened, but, as with stocks, not as dramatically as in recent recessions. High yield spreads were at 397basis points(bps) as of Wednesday morning, well below the 1,100 bps registered during COVID-19 and the 1,971 bps seen during the global financial crisis. Spreads, Allen notes, haven‚Äôt even reached levels from non-recessionary periods of market stress, like 2022 (583 bps) and 2016 (839 bps). Similarly, oil prices haven‚Äôt fallen as much as in recent recessions. Brent crude futures contracts had retreated about 13% since ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù (April 2), a significant drop but far from the two-thirds declines during COVID-19 and the financial crisis. The relatively modest drop ‚Äúsuggests that investors aren‚Äôt anticipating a huge slowdown for global growth just yet,‚Äù says Allen. Unfortunately for investors, the market's current resilience could bite them down the line. ""With markets not fully pricing in a recession, that opens significant downside risks if we do get one,"" says Allen. Recession risks could be lowered by improved U.S.-China relations, which appeared plausible on Wednesday after Trump said Tuesday that he expected China‚Äôs finaltariffs to be far lowerthan thecurrent rate of 145%.The Wall Street Journalon Wednesday reported officials are contemplating slashing the rate on Chinese imports to between 50% and 65%. Stocks have ralliedon the hope of de-escalation, but several economists havewarnedthat even lowered tariffs increase the risk of a slowdown. Trump has also abruptly changed plans in the past,leaving economists uncertainif warmer relations would last. ‚ÄúThe hard data over the coming days will be crucial,‚Äù said Allen. ‚ÄúInvestors have been reluctant to fully price in a recession because we don't have enough evidence that one is likely. But if that changes and we start to see contractionary numbers (e.g., a negative payrolls print), that would lead to a fresh reassessment that could open the way for a fresh selloff.‚Äù",News,https://www.investopedia.com/stocks-not-pricing-in-a-us-recession-says-deutsche-bank-11720753,3

2025-04-25 00:17:45,"Analysis-After years of failed AI deals, Intel plans homegrown challenge to Nvidia","By Arsheeya Bajwa, Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis (Reuters) -One of Intel's (INTC) biggest missteps over the past decade was the failure to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the fast-growing market for artificial intelligence chips. During his first earnings conference call with analysts as Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan outlined how Intel hopes to change that, but warned, ""This is not a quick fix."" Tan said he would comb through Intel's existing products to sharpen them for emerging trends in the AI market such as robotics and agents that can carry out tasks for human users. The undertaking will be challenging because Nvidia (NVDA) no longer sells just chips - it sells entire data centers, from chips to cables to software compilers. Tan on Thursday said Intel will take a similar approach. Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said that, in the near term, Intel won't make many more acquisitions. ""Our priority will need to be, at this point, getting the balance sheet to a better place,"" Zinsner told Reuters in an interview. The implication is that Tan's efforts to at last put together a coherent AI strategy will be homegrown. ""We are taking a holistic approach to redefine our portfolio, to optimize our products for new and emerging AI workloads,"" Tan said. ""Our goal is to become the platform of choice for our customers. This requires us to radically evolve our design and engineering mindset and anticipate the needs of our customer well in advance."" Historically, Intel's approach was to leave AI startups to do the work of developing new chips and then acquire them. Between 2016 and 2019, the company purchased a string of chip companies - Movidius, Mobileye, Nervana and Habana Labs - that it hoped would help it crack the AI market. While Mobileye retained a strong position in autonomous driving and Intel has retained a stake in the company after a spinout, the rest of the deals failed to help Intel gain traction against Nvidia. ‚ÄúIntel has a long history of building important new silicon developments within its own walls, so I‚Äôm not shocked to see them focus on in-house developments for AI,"" Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research, told Reuters. ""If they can build the appropriate set of software support to help make it easy to deploy these new chips, then they have a chance‚Äîbut that is a big if.‚Äù But other analysts said that Nvidia's dominant position, along with the efforts of major cloud-computing firms such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google (GOOG,GOOGL) to build their own AI chips, leaves little room for Intel to break into the market. The company provided a glimpse of its overall AI strategy and will focus on chips and systems that run AI applications and edge devices, according to Hendi Susanto, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which holds Intel shares. ""While these areas show promise, the scale and pace of their growth remain uncertain,"" Susanto said.

During an upswing in the stock, it‚Äôs worth keeping track of the $22 area, which sits roughly at the midway point of the extended trading range. The shares could run into overhead selling pressure in this location near the 50-day and200-day moving averagesand a trendline that connects multiplepeaks and troughson the chart stretching back to early August last year. Finally, a broader recovery could see Intel shares revisit the extended trading range‚Äôs upper trendline around $26. Investors who haveaccumulated the stockat lower levels may decide to book profits in this region near three notable peaks that formed on the chart between November and March.

2025-04-25 06:50:00,China May Exempt Some US Goods From Tariffs as Costs Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Gives New York ‚ÄòOne Last Chance‚Äô to End Congestion Fee Why Car YouTuber Matt Farah Is Fighting for Walkable Cities Backyard Micro-Flats Aim to Ease South Africa‚Äôs Housing Crisis The Racial Wealth Gap Is Not Just About Money To Fuel Affordable Housing, This Innovation Fund Targets Predevelopment Costs China‚Äôs government is considering suspending its 125% tariff on some US imports, people familiar with the matter said, as the economic costs of the tit-for-tat trade war weigh heavily on certain industries. Authorities are considering removing the additional levies for medical equipment and some industrial chemicals like ethane, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations. Officials are also discussing waiving the tariff for plane leases, the people said. Like many airlines, Chinese carriers don‚Äôt own all of their aircraft and pay leasing fees to third-party companies to use some jets ‚Äî payments that would have become financially ruinous with the additional tariff. The possibility of some goods being exempted boosted investor optimism, as shares in Asia rose and the yuan erased losses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another step toward a de-escalation of the trade war,‚Äù Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities Pte, said, attributing strength in Hong Kong, Chinese and Japanese stocks to the report. While most don‚Äôt expect the US and China to set aside their differences quickly, he said ‚Äúit would appear the worst may truly be over.‚Äù The exemptions China is mulling mirror similar moves on the part of the US, which excluded electronics from its 145% tariff on Chinese imports earlier this month. The pullbacks reflect how deeply intertwined the world‚Äôs two biggest economies are, with some key industries grinding to a halt after the trade war escalated. ‚ÄúA couple of our member companies have reported that even within the last week, they had a few shipments that were imported that did not have tariffs levied on them,‚Äù Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said during a press conference on Friday in Beijing. ‚ÄúIt does look like both governments are looking carefully and don‚Äôt want to stop trade overall.‚Äù While the US imports far more from China than the other way around, Beijing‚Äôs move spotlights the areas of its economy that remain reliant on US goods. China is the world‚Äôs largest plastics manufacturer but some of its factories depend on ethane, which is mainly imported from the US. And its hospitals rely on advanced medical equipment like magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound machines made by US firms like GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. China‚Äôs Ministry of Finance and General Administration of Customs didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment. The list of exemptions is still in flux and discussions may not progress. Companies in vulnerable sectors have been asked by authorities to submit the customs codes of US goods that they need to be exempt from the new tariffs, other people familiar with the matter said. At least one Chinese airline has been notified that payments to aircraft leasing companies located in free trade zones will not be subject to the new levy, one person said. Traders have also been circulating purportedly tariff-exempt lists of customs codes that correlate to key chemicals and chip-making components. Bloomberg News could not independently verify the lists. Beijing is also preparing to waive additional tariffs on at least eight semiconductor-related products, Caijing reported Friday, citing anonymous sources. Those categories don‚Äôt include memory chips for the time being, the outlet said, in a potential blow to Micron Technology Inc., the world‚Äôs No. 3 memory chipmaker. Subscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak Podcast on Apple, Spotify and other Podcast Platforms. What Bloomberg Economics Says... ‚ÄúExempting critical, hard-to-replace US products from tariffs would be a pragmatic approach that could ease tensions with the US and serve the interests of Chinese industry. Anything that helps lower the temperature in the trade war is also beneficial from the perspective of avoiding broader clashes with the US.‚Äù ‚Äî Chang Shu and Eric Zhu Read the full note here. Investors are looking for signs that the two countries will engage to lower tariffs, but relations appear to still be at a standstill. On Thursday, Chinese officials publicly demanded the US revoke all unilateral tariffs before agreeing to trade talks. President Donald Trump has tried to get President Xi Jinping on the phone since he returned to office, but the Chinese leader has, so far, resisted, pushing instead for lower-level talks to work out a deal. On the US front, Trump‚Äôs administration has exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs ‚Äî a major reprieve for global technology manufacturers including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., though potentially a temporary one. The exclusions apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips as well as flat-screen displays. --With assistance from Lucille Liu and Shikhar Balwani.

2025-04-25 07:15:00,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Nvidia Stock Is Going to $150. Is It a Buy?,"Chip export restrictions to China have been an overhang onNvidia(NVDA3.56%)shares. But after dipping below the $100 level,Bank of Americaanalyst Vivek Arya believes the leadingartificial intelligence (AI)chipmaker is worth buying. Earlier this week, the analyst lowered the firm'sprice targeton the shares from $160 to $150, implying 44% upside over the recent $104 share price, while maintaining a ""buy"" rating. Nvidia disclosed on April 15 it would take a $5.5 billion financial hit as a result of the U.S. government's licensing requirement for its H20 chip designed for the China market. Last year, China made up 13% of the company's revenue. It's a hit in the near term, but long term, Nvidia has more opportunities to drive growth. The analyst sees export restrictions of advanced AI chips causing a marginal shortfall to Nvidia'srevenue and earningsin the near term, but the recent dip in the stock, which shaved more than $300 billion off Nvidia'smarket cap, more than accounts for the revenue loss. Nvidia has already hauled in $11 billion of revenue from sales of its Blackwell AI computing platform, and that figure will continue to grow. The demand from tech giants to install Blackwell in their data centers is expected to drive strong growth this year. The analyst sees Nvidia's margins improving in the second half of the year as it continues to ramp production of Blackwell and prepare for Blackwell Ultra. Even with uncertainty for the economy, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to grow more than 50% this year. Yet investors can buy the stock for just 22 times forward earnings estimates. No one has a crystal ball for whereNvidia shareswill be in one year, especially given market volatility. But given Nvidia's dominant position as the leading supplier of AI chips, the long-term upside from buying shares now appears to far outweigh the risks in the short term.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/wall-street-analyst-thinks-nvidia-stock-150-buy/?.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-25 07:45:00,"Tesla Stock vs. Nvidia Stock: The Best Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street","Tesla(TSLA3.29%)andNvidia(NVDA3.56%)are the two of the most highly traded and widely discussed stocks on the market. Dan Ives at Wedbush recently said they were two of the ""best disruptive technology companies in the world."" But most Wall Street analysts see one stock as the better buy. Wall Street analysts in aggregate view Nvidia as a better buy than Tesla at current prices. Here's what investors should know. Tesla reported dismal first-quarter financial results that missed estimates on the top and bottom lines. Sales fell 9% to $19.3 billion,operating margincontracted 3 percentage points to a six-year low, andnon-GAAPnet income dropped 40% to $0.27 per share. The company also withheld guidance for the second quarter because of uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy. Importantly, CEO Elon Musk on the quarterly conference call acknowledged that his role in theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)has brought blowback on Tesla. The company has ceded its position as the leader in battery electric vehicle sales to Chinese automakerBYD, in part because Musk inadvertently politicized Tesla. Even longtime Tesla bull Dan Ives warned that the brand destruction caused by Musk would be permanent if he failed to separate himself from politics and refocus on the company in the near future. Asset manager Ross Gerber even told Bloomberg that Musk ""doesn't care"" about Tesla anymore. Fortunately, Musk seems to have taken the hint. He said on the first-quarter earnings call that his ""time allocation at DOGE will drop significantly"" in the coming months. Musk also said the company remains on track to launchrobotaxi servicesin Austin by June and predicted Tesla would eventually have 99% market share in autonomous ride-sharing. Importantly, Musk believes robotaxis could ""move the financial needle in a significant way"" by the second half of 2026. Of course, the company has overpromised and underdelivered in the past, but some analysts believe the narrative. Gene Munster at Deepwater says Tesla may be a ""train wreck"" in the short run but a ""rocket ship"" in the long run. Wall Street estimates adjusted earnings will grow at 24% annually through 2026, according to LSEG. That makes the current valuation of 110times adjusted earningslook expensive, but Tesla may surprise to the upside as it leans into robotaxis. Patient investors with a time horizon of at least five years can buy a small position today. Nvidia reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 78% to $39 billion on particularly strong sales growth in the data center segment, and non-GAAP earnings increased 71% to $0.89 per diluted share. The only blemish was 3 percentage point decline in gross margin to 73.5%. Nvidia is the market leader in data centergraphics processing units(GPUs), chips used to accelerate complex workloads such as training machine learning models and running AI applications. But the company is particularly formidable because its compute platform includes adjacent data center hardware such asCPUsand networking gear, as well as an expansive suite of software development tools called CUDA. Nvidia is addressing not only current technologies such asgenerative AIbut also emerging technologies such asself-driving cars and autonomous robots. And because CUDA is the industry standard for accelerated computing, analysts generally think the company will maintain its dominant position in data center AI chips. In fact, Angelo Zino at CFRA Research says Nvidia ""will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade."" Nvidia has a catalyst on the horizon in the ongoing production ramp of its next-generation Blackwell chip. CEO Jensen Huang earlier this year told Yahoo! Finance that demand for Blackwell is incredible, and CFO Colette Kress says gross margin should rebound to the mid-70% range as Blackwell GPUs account for more of total revenue. Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 37% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 34 times adjusted earnings look cheap. Patient investors with a time horizon of at least three years should feel comfortable buying a position today.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/tesla-stock-nvidia-stock-best-buy-now-wall-street/?.tsrc=rss,4

2025-04-25 08:44:00,Wall Street Is Screaming to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now. Should You Listen?,"Nvidia(NVDA3.56%)is down roughly 30% below its previous high. This isn't a new experience for the stock. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1999, Nvidia's share price has plunged by that amount or more from its previous peak eight other times. Importantly, Nvidia eventually rebounded strongly every time in the past after a steep sell-off. With that in mind, it's probably not surprising that Wall Street is screaming to buy Nvidia stock hand over fist right now. But should you listen? Nine analysts have issued ratings on Nvidia in the second half of April. Eight recommend buying the stock.Raymond Jamesviews Nvidia as a ""strong buy."" The lone outlier who didn't join in the loud chorus for Nvidia was D.A. Davidson. This financial services company is headquartered far away from Wall Street in Great Falls, Montana. But even D.A. Davidson has a ""neutral"" recommendation for Nvidia and a price target that reflects an upside potential of 15%. Yahoo! Finance scores analysts based on the accuracy of their stock ratings and price targets. Guess how many of the top 10 analysts on this scorecard recommend buying Nvidia stock? Pat yourself on the back if your answer was all of them. The average analysts' 12-month price target for Nvidia is a whopping 58% higher than the current share price. Some top analysts are even more bullish. For example, Cantor Fitzgerald and Rosenblatt both recently came out with a price target of $200, reflecting an upside potential of roughly 92%. Wall Street's consensus is that Nvidia is a great stock to buy hand over fist right now. Why such enthusiasm? Many analysts remain convinced that Nvidia's growth prospects will continue to be strong. For example, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri recently wrote to clients that Nvidia'sforward price-to-earnings multiple, which was then at 27x, already reflects risks related to exporting H20GPUsto China. Pajjuri noted that the company's Blackwell GB200 chip shipments are increasing with the new GB300 chips on track to begin shipping in Nvidia's fiscal third quarter. He predicted these factors ""should help sustain momentum through the year."" What about worries thatAmazon, one of Nvidia's biggest customers, is hitting the pause button on leasing new space for data centers? Sure,Wells Fargosuggested this was happening in a report to its clients. However, Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers for Amazon Web Services, addressed the issue head-on in a recent LinkedIn post:  Wall Street doesn't appear to be overly concerned about rising competition for Nvidia, either. That's not surprising to me, considering what formerIntelCEO Pat Gelsinger recently said in an interview with Yahoo! Finance's Brian Sozzi. Gelsinger told Sozzi that it would be very difficult for any rival to knock Nvidia off its perch. He said, ""I've always viewed that there's sort of this 10x rule, where if you're not 10x better than the king, you're not going to displace that."" No competitor has chips anywhere close to being 10x better than Nvidia's most powerful GPUs. Should you listen to Wall Street about buying Nvidia stock? Yes and no. No investor should buy any stock solely because an analyst recommended it. It's always important to do your own research. Your investing goals or risk tolerance could cause you to avoid a stock that Wall Street loves -- and that's OK. However, I think Wall Street is right about Nvidia. The latest pullback presents a great buying opportunity for long-term investors. When Nvidia has traded at such a discount in the past, it was something worth screaming about.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/wall-street-is-screaming-to-buy-nvidia-stock-hand/?.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-25 08:57:00,2 Vanguard ETFs That Have Crushed the Market This Year,"Entering trading on Tuesday, theS&P 500was down more than 12% since the start of the year. What started out looking like it might be a good year in 2025 with some early gains may end up being a nightmare for investors. The S&P 500 was trading at elevated levels prior to this sell-off, and it has been highly vulnerable to how tech stocks perform, given how significant their positions are in the index.Nvidia, for example, is down 28% this year. While it has helped the index achieve tremendous returns in recent years, it's among the stocks dragging it down right now. So where should investors look for safety these days? A couple of top-performing Vanguard funds may offer some attractive options. Both theVanguard FTSE Europe ETF(VGK1.33%)and theVanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF(VYMI1.05%)are in positive territory thus far this year, and are easily outperforming the market. Here's a closer look at these exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to see whether they might be good investments to add to your portfolio today.  VYMIdata byYCharts. This Vanguard ETF gives investors exposure to top stocks in Europe, which can be valuable at a time when the U.S. is involved in trade wars with multiple countries. European businesses likely won't come out of that unscathed, but they may offer investors a way to at least diversify and be less dependent on the U.S. economy. There are more than 1,200 stocks in this Vanguard fund, including highly recognizable names such asSAP,Nestle, andASML Holdings-- the top three holdings in the fund. However, no stock accounts for more than 2% of the ETF's overall weight, which ensures that there isn't too much dependence on how a single company performs. Other attractive features of the ETF include its lowexpense ratioof 0.06% and its relatively high dividend yield of 3.2%, which is more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.5%. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF has been doing well this year, and given the diversification it can provide your portfolio with, it may be a good investment to hang on to, not only for this year but over the long haul. Investors can seek out even more diversification with this Vanguard fund, which focuses on stocks all around the world -- with the exception of the U.S. Europe accounts for the bulk of the fund's holdings at 44%, followed by the Pacific region at 26% and emerging markets at 22%. It has more than 1,500 stocks in its portfolio, and within this ETF, the largest holding (Nestle) accounts for just 1.8% of its total weight. Other names among its top three includeRocheandShell. Due to its exposure to emerging markets, this Vanguard fund may be the riskier choice of the two on this list. But if your goal is international diversification outside the U.S. market, then it may still make for a suitable investment worth hanging on to. The fund does have a higher expense ratio of 0.17%, but its higher yield of 4.5% can more than make up for that. One of the fund's key features is that it seeks out stocks that it expects will generate above-average yields. Fordividend investorslooking for safety and recurring income, that can make this a great ETF to buy and hold for the long haul.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/2-vanguard-etfs-that-have-crushed-the-market-this/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-25 10:20:00,President Donald Trump Just Dealt a Jarring Blow to Nvidia. Can the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip King Recover and Reclaim Its Previous Highs?,"Things have gone from bad to worse this year for the artificial intelligence (AI) chip kingNvidia(NVDA3.56%). It all started with the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese start-up that used less advanced Nvidia chips to build a chatbot that could rival OpenAI's ChatGPT, supposedly at a fraction of the cost. This made some investors question what AI infrastructure spending might ultimately look like at a time when valuations across the industry were sky high. Then, Nvidia had to deal with the threat of tariffs since the company sources a lot of its chips from Taiwan. Although Trump has excluded semiconductors from his tariffs, the administration just dealt another blow to Nvidia stock. On April 15 after the market close, Nvidia disclosed in a filing that the U.S. government had informed the company it would need to obtain a license to export its H20 chips to China, including Hong Kong and Macao. The government told Nvidia the purpose of this restriction is to prevent China from obtaining parts it could use to build a supercomputer. As a result, Nvidia said it expects to take a $5.5 billion charge in its fiscal 2026 first quarter due to H20 chip inventory, purchase commitments, and associated reserves. Nvidia has been dealing with increased export restrictions to China since the Biden administration. In fact, the company created the H20 chip, which trains AI models less quickly than some of the company's most advanced chips, in order to comply with previous restrictions. Trump's latest order is likely tied to the tense relations between the U.S. and China, but considering these actions have now been building through multiple administrations, it's also possible this export restriction may outlast the current trade war. Nvidia stock is down roughly 24% year to date. During an appearance on CNBC, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives referred to the new restrictions as a ""blockade"" by the U.S. government and the ""first shot across the bow."" He said the near-term effect is that Wall Street analysts are likely to model zero revenue from China for Nvidia this year and take earnings projections down 10%. In fiscal 2025, Nvidia generated about $17.1 billion in revenue from China, or about 13% of its top line. The export restrictions and continued uncertainty stemming from the trade war will have negative near-term impacts on the company from a margin and earnings perspective. That said, much of the sell-off this year already reflects this headwind. However, analysts largely remain bullish on Nvidia as the best-in-classartificial intelligencechipmaker in an AI industry that is still in the early innings of its growth. Sure, the total addressable market might be smaller right now, but other chip players likeAMDare facing similar challenges. Meanwhile, Nvidia's latest-generation Blackwell chip generated $11.0 billion in revenue last quarter, ""the fastest product ramp in [the] company's history."" CEO Jensen Huang is already talking about the company's next chip, the Vera Rubin, which will be faster than Blackwell and could be ready by 2026. After that, Nvidia has plans for even better offerings in 2028. The stock now trades at 23 times forward earnings estimates, near its lowest level in two years. It could be rough sledding for the industry this year, but if you can take a long-term view, this is the time to start accumulating shares. Nvidia can eventuallyreclaim its previous highof $153 per share, implying significant upside from current levels.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/president-donald-trump-just-dealt-a-jarring-blow-t/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-25 10:30:00,"Amid Market Chaos, Downside Protection Securities Beloved By Brokers Are Booming","Structured Notes and Buffer funds are sleep-well-at-night products designed to protect investors from market drops. Brokers and nervous investors love them, despite their complexity and fees.  Talk to any financial advisor these days, and he or she is likely to have a strong opinion about something known as ‚Äústructured notes.‚Äù These complex products are sold as the ‚Äúhave your cake and eat it‚Äù investments of the wealth management world. Their specialty is flexibility ‚Äìsome are geared toward growth and others toward income. Returns are generally capped and in all cases the goal is to limit downside risk. They are manufactured by big banks like JPMorgan using derivatives, and are often sold as ‚Äústock market-linked‚Äù with ‚Äúsleep well at night‚Äù protection. They come with various maturities, typically ranging from six months to five years, provide principal protection and sometimes offer annual yields of 10% or more.  Up until the last few years, structured notes were mostly the domain of hedge funds and other sophisticated investors or ultra-wealthy clients. But thanks to clever engineering, the notes are now being offered by scores of brokers and sold in bite-sized $1000 increments. The current market volatility and uncertainty has caused them to surge in popularity. Last year the broker-sold U.S. structured notes market reached a record high of nearly $150 billion, up 46% from the previous year, according to London‚Äôs Deriva Intelligence. JPMorgan was the top issuer in 2024, followed closely by the likes of Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays.  ‚ÄúI absolutely love structured notes,‚Äù says Anh Tran, an independent advisor at $350 million (assets) SageMint Wealth in Irvine, California. Structured notes make up about 30% of the allocation in most of Tran‚Äôs client portfolios. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had so many calls from advisors reaching out asking if we can talk to them about how we run our portfolios,‚Äù says Tran.  ‚ÄúClients are using structured notes not because they‚Äôre ‚Äòhot,‚Äô but because they allow you to take more control of the outcome,‚Äù insists Michaelangelo Dooley, Structured Note Strategies Portfolio Manager at $30 billion investment advisory NewEdge. Dooley is referring to the fact that these securities can be tailor made to meet the demand created by specific market environments. A few years ago when rates were low, for example, stock market notes offering income of 10-12% were popular. ‚ÄúEach [note] is entirely different with the risk that it takes on. Even within the same category‚Äîlike contingent yield notes‚Äîtwo products might have similar structures but vastly different outcomes based on the underlying assets.‚Äù One could be tied to the S&P 500, another to Tesla or Nvidia stock, Dooley notes, adding: ‚ÄúThey are not comparable trades.‚Äù  Take Bank of Montreal‚Äôs freshly issued Senior Medium Term Notes, Series K, Market Linked Notes due April 2028. The notes, which are one of the first products to roll off of a $78 billion shelf registration, bear no interest and are designed to track the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, which is down 11% year to date. The maximum gain noteholders are entitled to is 22.8%. Thus, if in three years, when the notes are due, the Nasdaq100 is up 35% from its level on April 25, 2025, investors will only be entitled to $1,228.00 for each $1000 par amount note. However if tech stocks continue to fall and the Nasdaq 100 is down 35%, the BMO structured note holders get their original $1,000 returned.  Another type of structured note is known as a ‚Äúbuffered‚Äù note. These, which typically track an index like the S&P 500, allow for a cushion‚Äîsay, 20% or 30%‚Äîagainst losses. If the asset declines 15%, the investor‚Äôs principal is preserved. If it drops 35%, the first 30% is protected and the investor takes only the final 5% loss. Contingent income notes offer periodic income‚Äîsay, 9% annually‚Äîas long as the underlying asset or index doesn‚Äôt fall below a preset barrier. They are often ‚Äúautocallable,‚Äù meaning they redeem early if the reference asset hits a high price target price. If markets are stable or rising, this feature can allow for quick realization of gains and capital return. But when markets stay choppy‚Äîlike they have been in 2025‚Äîthe notes may linger to maturity, still paying income but testing investor patience. Contingent barrier notes, meanwhile, act like a trapdoor. If the index stays above a set barrier‚Äîcommonly 60-75% of its initial value‚Äîthe investor gets their principal back, possibly with a coupon. But if the barrier is breached, protection vanishes, and the note‚Äôs return moves in tandem with the underlying asset, meaning that the client assumes a 1:1 loss. According to Andrew Kuefler, SVP of Product Strategy at alternative investments marketplace iCapital, the current volatility has made these autocallable contingent income notes especially attractive. ‚ÄúWhen uncertainty spikes, these products offer yields in the 7‚Äì10% range with 30‚Äì45% downside protection,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAdvisors are using them to harvest volatility and generate income without taking full equity risk.‚Äù Following market events like Trump‚Äôs tariff announcement, Kuefler noted quote requests surged by 140% week-over-week‚Äîclear evidence of rising advisor interest. These novel securities are not without their costs. Bank of Montreal charges advisory firms a 2.5% commission for creating the notes. Then financial advisors likewise, get their cut from clients after that. Unlike ETFs of mutual funds, these notes also have limited liquidity and even under the best case scenario, an investor would likely do just as well by investing in a high yield corporate bond fund, which is inherently less risky and less complex. Vanguard‚Äôs High Yield Bond Fund, with its expense ratio of 0.22%, is currently yielding 7%, about the same annual return you would achieve under the best case scenario with the BMO‚Äôs new Nasdaq100-Linked structured notes. Greenwich Connecticut‚Äôs AQR Research is a big critic of structured notes like BMO‚Äôs, as well as similarly structured funds and ETFs that are sold as ‚ÄúDefined Outcome‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuffer‚Äù Funds. In March, AQR issued research saying it would be smarter and cheaper for investors to simply their exposure from 100% stocks, to say 70% with 30% in Treasury bills, than to invest in one of these options-fueled funds. ‚ÄúThese ‚Äòbuffer funds‚Äô are a marketing success, a success for the managers selling them, and a failure for investors lured in by the overpromise of magical equity returns without equity risk and then overcharged for the pleasure,‚Äù writes Daniel Villalon, Global co-head of portfolio solutions at AQR. Like their broker-sold cousins ‚Äúbuffer ETFs‚Äù have soared in popularity recently. According to Morningstar, assets have ballooned to $58 billion up from their inception in 2018. One of the most popular is Defined Wealth Shield ETF, from Wheaton, Illinois‚Äô Innovator Funds. The $1.4 billion (assets) fund whose symbol BALT, stands for ‚Äúbond alternative‚Äù and like other buffer ETFs, is designed to allow for some market gain participation but limit losses. BALT allows investors to participate in S&P 500 gains capped at 2.47% each quarter, but protects them from any losses up to 20% on the downside during the same quarter. During 2024‚Äôs roaring 23% run in the S&P 500, BALT owners would have earned just under 10%. Year-to-date, with the S&P down 9% BALT is off only 1%. Critics of structured investment vehicles argue that the complexity masks inefficiencies and cost. They also warn that their perceived safety evaporates during black swan type economic events‚Äîlike a global recession. Structured notes are unsecured obligations and are thus, only as sound as the financial institutions issuing them. During the financial crisis, investors lost nearly all of their principal in the more than $18 billion in structured notes issued by Lehman Brothers. ‚ÄúBanks and advisors make a ton of money on them,‚Äù says one Morgan Stanley advisor who asked to remain anonymous. ‚ÄúBut in worst-case scenarios like 2008, they were the worst thing to hold.

2025-04-25 11:00:00,2 Unstoppable Stocks Destined to Achieve a $1 Trillion Valuation,"The $1 trillion stock club has been getting a bit thinner amid the stock market sell-off, as a handful of companies have fallen out of this prestigious club. At this writing, there are only eight companies with a $1 trillion valuation worldwide, but two more could easily join their ranks over the next few months if the market recovers. Taiwan Semiconductor(TSM3.88%)andBroadcom(AVGO6.33%)are two companies that are destined to join the $1 trillion valuation club. Each has already reached that threshold but is currently on the outside looking in thanks to the sell-offs. These two companies will be OK over the long term and will likely rejoin the $1 trillion club either this year or next. Here's a closer look. Broadcom and TSMC aren't that far away from joining the $1 trillion club, as Broadcom and TSMC are currently valued at around $800 billion and $770 billion, respectively. That's still a 25% increase from today's level to get to $1 trillion, so if these stocks can do that in short order, they could be fantastic stocks to buy right now. TSMC is the world's largest chip foundry. It makes chips for its clients who cannot do so themselves. These include companies likeNvidia(NVDA3.56%),Apple(AAPL1.84%), and Broadcom. By staying neutral in the chip production world, Taiwan Semiconductor isn't competing against its clients, which is why it has grown to become the top option in the foundry space. Another reason it is near the top is its drive to offer the most advanced technology. Currently, TSMC's most powerful chip is the 3 nanometer (nm) variety, which means chip traces are spaced at a minimum of 3 nm apart. However, it's slated to launch 2 nm and 1.6 nm chips this year and next, which represent improvements over current technology. As for tariffs,Taiwan Semi's CEO recently made this comment: We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies. However, we have not seen any change in our customers' behavior so far. Therefore, we continue to expect our full year 2025 revenue to increase by close to mid-20s percent in U.S. dollar terms. This is an extremely bullish comment by the CEO, and it makes me even more confident that TSMC will eventually return to the $1 trillion club. Broadcom does many different things, but one emerging product line makes me bullish on the stock. Its custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs, are an alternative toNvidia's GPUs, which have dominated the AI computing marketplace. Some customers are fed up with the prices they have to pay for Nvidia's GPUs and prefer Broadcom's XPUs because they are tailored to one workload, such as those used to train an AI model, eliminating ancillary functions that one customer may use and another doesn't. While the adoption of these units doesn't spell the end for Nvidia, it does open the door for Broadcom to steal a sliver of the market, which it projects it will do shortly. By 2027, Broadcom expects the addressable market for XPUs to be $60 billion to $90 billion from just three clients. With two clients launching their XPUs later this year and two more clients selecting Broadcom to produce their XPUs, that market opportunity is expected to expand. Considering Broadcom's trailing 12-month revenue totals $54.5 billion, any growth from this segment will dramatically boost its overall total. This makes Broadcom a great stock to pick up for cheap, as the latest market sell-off has opened up an attractive buying opportunity. From aforward price-to-earnings (P/E) standpoint, both Broadcom and TSMC look like bargain deals.  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Broadcom has a slightly higher premium than TSMC, as investors aren't as worried about Broadcom losing as much business as TSMC. However, the price you pay for both businesses is still much cheaper than in recent months. I think both stocks look like great deals nowand will provide investors with market-beating returns over the long term. However, you'll have to be patient, as there are plenty of fears regarding tariffs surrounding the broader economy.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/2-unstoppable-stocks-destined-to-achieve-a-1-trill/?.tsrc=rss,4

Since then, broader market volatility on the back of US president Donald Trump's fast-moving tariff agenda has weighed on the Mag 7, amid concerns that this will tip the US into recession. AJ Bell's (AJB.L) investment experts Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth said in previously that the Mag 7 have lost nearly $4tn (¬£3tn) of stock market capitalisation between them since their aggregate valuation hit $18.4tn on 24 December, which represents a drop of one-fifth.

This growth is fueled by several enduring factors:    Cloud Services: Azure and Microsoft 365 continue to be powerful growth engines as businesses accelerate digital transformation initiatives. Artificial Intelligence: Microsoft has strategically integrated AI across its product portfolio, with its AI business already exceeding $13B in annual revenue. Gaming Expansion: The Activision Blizzard acquisition has significantly strengthened Microsoft's gaming division, substantially boosting Xbox content and services revenue.  Profitability Picture Despite a slight margin contraction (from 36.7% to 35.4%) due to increased AI and R&D investments, Microsoft maintains an exceptionally healthy 35% net margin. The company's EPS has increased 29% from $9.65 in 2022 to $12.41 in the trailing twelve months.

Before you say it - yes we know the chip giant's stock just surged on tariff relief rumors - but that‚Äôs like a dead cat bounce. Under the hood, risks are piling up. Don‚Äôt be surprised if Nvidia tanks to $60 before another truly bullish rally takes over.

2025-04-25 11:45:00,Elon Musk Thinks Tesla Will Become the World's Most Valuable Company. Here's Why Its Stock Could Decline by 50% (or More) Instead,"Tesla(TSLA3.29%)stock hit a new record high shortly after President Donald Trump's election win last November because investors thought a friendlier regulatory environment could help the company bring its autonomous robotaxi and humanoid robot to market more quickly. CEO Elon Musk thinks these product platforms will help Tesla become the world's most valuable company one day. In fact, Musk believes Tesla could eventually be as valuable as the next five largest companies combined. Today, those companies would beApple,Microsoft,Nvidia,Alphabet, andAmazon, which have a combined value of $11.8 trillion. But Tesla stock is currently heading in the wrong direction. It's down 47% from its recent all-time high, and a series of headwinds are plaguing its core business, which could lead to afurtherdecline of 50% (or more) from here. Image source: Tesla. Although Musk might be focused on autonomous vehicles and robotics,electric vehicle(EV) sales still make up 72% of Tesla's total revenue -- and unfortunately, they are sinking right now. Sales fell by 1% during 2024 to 1.79 million cars, but the decline accelerated to 13% in the first quarter of 2025. The Q1 decline in deliveries sent Tesla's automotive revenue tumbling by 20% year over year, and its overallnet income(profit) plunging by a whopping 71%. There are several layers to the company's problems: Competition is ramping up in the EV space with numerous low-cost producers entering the market, and consumers soured on the Tesla brand this year because of Musk's involvement in politics. On the competition front, Tesla is up against China-based EV producers likeBYD, which is capable of selling cars for as little as $10,000 in its domestic market. BYD is also making its way into Europe, where it could snatch some of the market share Tesla has spent years accumulating. On the political front,Muskhas spent a lot of time running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was established to reduce wasteful spending in the U.S. government to bring down the national debt. Musk and his team faced criticism for laying off government workers and slashing funding from programs like the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to the point there have been regular protests at Tesla dealerships around the world. Here's the good news: Tesla is planning to roll out some lower-cost EVs of its own later this year, and Musk just told investors he plans to spend less time at DOGE starting from May, so he can focus more on the EV maker instead. These are important steps toward repairing some of the damage Tesla has suffered over the past few months. Tesla's Cybercab robotaxi is designed to autonomously haul passengers around the clock within a ride-hailing network, creating a new revenue stream for the company. However, it isn't expected to go into mass production until next year, and it could take some time after that before it brings in meaningful amounts of money. Plus, Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) software still isn't approved for unsupervised use on public roads, and the Cybercab can't operate without it. Thisplaces Tesla behind competitorslike Waymo, which is already completing 250,000 paid autonomous trips every week. With that said, Tesla could leapfrog Waymo when FSD wins regulatory approval. The unsupervised version of the software will be compatible with most of Tesla's passenger EVs, so the company will have a fleet of millions of customer cars which could start earning revenue for their owners (and Tesla) by offering autonomous ride-hailing services. Plus, Musk says the Cybercab is around 80% cheaper to produce than Waymo's vehicles, so Tesla will have a serious pricing advantage when the robotaxi eventually achieves scale. Then there is the Optimus humanoid robot. Musk says Tesla will produce thousands of them this year to perform tasks in its own factories. But he thinks the company could produce over 1 million annually by 2029. Humanoids like Optimus will be capable of doing dangerous or repetitive jobs that humans don't want to do, but they will also be useful as household assistants. As a result, Musk has previously told investors there could be more humanoid robots than humans by the year 2040, which is why he predicts Optimus could bring in a staggering $10 trillion in revenue over the long term. Tesla could become the most valuable company in the world one day on the back of FSD, the Cybercab, and Optimus. But in the here and now, it faces a serious valuation problem. Based on Tesla's trailing 12-monthearnings per share(EPS) of $1.74, its stock trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 148.6, making it a whopping five times as expensive as theNasdaq-100index which trades at a P/E ratio of 27.1. Moreover, Tesla is materially more expensive than the five companies it hopes to surpass one day:  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts. Simply put, Tesla's valuation will be a roadblock to further upside in the near term. Even if Musk is right about the company's potential in the long run, that isn't necessarily a good reason to pay such a hefty premium for the stock today. Remember, meaningful revenue from autonomous driving and Optimus could be years away, and if EV sales continue to shrink in the meantime, Tesla could face spiraling earnings which will make its stock appear even more expensive. Therefore, even though Tesla stock is already down 47% from its record high, there is a looming risk it could suffer a further decline of 50% (or more) to bring its valuation closer to those of its big-tech peers. It would have to decline by 76% just to trade in line withNvidia'sP/E ratio, for example, and that is one of the fastest growing companies in the world.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/elon-musk-tesla-become-valuable-stock-decline-50/?.tsrc=rss,4

2025-04-25 12:00:00,2 Top Stocks You Can Buy Now With $500,"Wall Street's concerns over tariffs and how President Donald Trump's trade wars will impact the U.S. economy have sent theNasdaq Compositedown by around 18% year to date, and it's off more than 20% from its peak. But if you have some extra cash available that you won't need to spend in the near term or use for other financial priorities like reducing debt, the market's current sell-off offers a great opportunity to invest. Shares of thebest companiesin the world are trading at prices that may significantly undervalue their future growth. For less than $500, you can buy one share each ofAmazon(AMZN0.17%)andApple(AAPL-0.05%). These are two of the strongest consumer brands, and both are in great positions to benefit from the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI). The first stock I would buy with $500 is the leading cloud service and online retail brand. The market sell-off has taken Amazon down to $166 per share at the time of this writing. Amazon generated record profits and cash flow last year, which last summer brought its price-to-free-cash-flow valuation down to the lowest level in over 15 years. Since 2005, on a price-to-cash-from-operationsbasis, Amazon stock has traded at multiples ranging from 12 to 48. Today, it's trading at just 15, which is a steal of a price for investors, particularly considering that it doubled its cash from operations over the last five years. The cloud infrastructure services market was worth $330 billion in 2024, and it's growing at a rate of more than 20% annually, according to Synergy Research. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is well positioned for long-term growth as spending on AI continues to grow. More than 1,000generative AIapplications have already been built using the tools available on AWS. Amazon's AI revenue is growing at a triple-digit percentage annually. The operating profit from that segment of the business totaled nearly $40 billion in 2024, comprising 58% of the company's top line. AI is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and it's a key growth driver for Amazon's business and share price. Amazon could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI over the long term. It's an expensive technology in part because it must be powered and trained using high-end chips, the majority of which come from a single supplier (Nvidia), and demand for them is outpacing supply. But Amazon is in the process of reducing the cost of AI for enterprise customers by investing in developing its own AI chips. As it becomes more cost-efficient to use AI supported by AWS, that could drive even more demand for the cloud service. With a business that is producing a gusher of profits as AI takes off,Amazonis one of the best growth stocks to buy in the wake of the recent market correction. Not long ago, Apple shares were trading at premiumprice-to-earningsmultiples based on high expectations that the new AI features it was rolling out would boost sales of its newest iPhones and computers. However, the stock has fallen by 24% from its recent highs, bringing the share price under $200 for the first time in about a year. It's trading at a more reasonable earnings multiple, which should position those who buy it now for a rewarding result over the long term. At its recent peak, the stock was trading over 35 times this year's earnings estimate. It is now trading at a more reasonable valuation of 26 times forward earnings. Trump's tariffs could increase iPhone prices and put pressure on sales -- the smartphone again accounted for more than half of Apple's total revenue last quarter -- but over the long term, the company's growth prospects look solid. Apple Intelligence could drive more growth for the company. It has seen stronger sales of the iPhone 16 in markets where the AI offering is available, but it's early. Over the long term, Apple Intelligence will get smarter and could open up growth opportunities that are not reflected in the stock's current valuation. The consumer tech giant has a massive installed base of more than 2.3 billion active devices. The iPhone is its most popular device, and it's a product customers carry with them everywhere they go. AI features can make these devices even stickier and drive more sales of services (e.g., apps and subscriptions) -- Apple's fastest-growing revenue opportunity. Apple is generating huge profits, with $96 billion in trailing-12-monthnet incomeon $396 billion of revenue. There's no doubt it's going to benefit tremendously from Apple Intelligence. BuyingAppleshares at their recent prices should lead to solid returns over the next decade. Analysts' consensus estimate is that the company's earnings will grow by just over 10% annually. Given its opportunities to drive more sales by marketing its latest products with their new AI features, investors can be confident that the most valuable brand in the world will grow more valuable over time.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/2-top-stocks-you-can-buy-now-with-500/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-25 12:07:19,Skechers USA Stock Sinks as Footwear Firm Pulls Outlook,"Skechers USA (SKX) shares tumbled in premarket trading Friday, a day after the footwear maker pulled its full-year forecasts amid tariffs uncertainty. The shoe company said after the bell Thursday that it was suspending its full-year outlook it provided last quarter ""due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies."" In February, Skechers' fiscal 2025 outlook disappointed as the company said it expected sales of $9.7 billion to $9.8 billion andearnings per share (EPS)of $4.30 to $4.50. For the first quarter, Skechers reported $2.41 billion in sales along with adjusted EPS of $1.17, with both metrics coming in narrowly below Visible Alpha consensus estimates. Last month, Morgan Stanley analysts said footwear makers like Skechers could be particularly hard hit by tariffs on imports from countries like Vietnam, as roughly a third of the shoes imported into the U.S. last year came from the country.

2025-04-25 13:10:27,"Nvidia (NVDA) Will Benefit From Resolution of Trade War in the Medium Term, Veteran Analyst Says","The Trump administration is looking to resolve the trade war between the U.S and China, and the dispute is likely to be resolved in the next 90 days, Patrick Moorhead¬† Founder, CEO, and Chief Analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy told Yahoo Finance recently. Moorhead suggested that the administration's stance makes NVDA stock attractive for investors with at least a medium-term time horizon. On the other hand, NVDA and other large chip makers are facing a major risk, Moorhead warned. Moorhead Suggests That NVDA Is Attractive for Medium-to-Long-Term Investors Moorhead was asked ""What should investors be looking at in terms of a psychological marker or a technical marker in order to determine if this is a safe level to invest in Nvidia?"" He answered, ""A psychological marker is that the Trump administration has painted itself into a little bit of a corner and is trying to find a way out of (the trade wars). That's because (officials) know if you bring down Apple (AAPL) and you bring down Nvidia (NVDA), you're taking the stock market down."" The analyst added that he is ""pretty confident"" that the trade issues ""will be resolved in the next 90 days."" Nvidia, Peers Are Still Facing a Major Risk Since Nvidia obtains 20%-30% of its revenue from China, the company would take a major hit if the U.S. sought to restrict the export of notebook and gaming chips to China, according to Moorhead. AMD (AMD) and Intel¬† (INTC) are in a similar situation, he added. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

2025-04-25 13:45:00,Meet the Latest Supercharged AI Stock I Bought During the Stock Market Downturn,"There are plenty of stocks on sale right now with the market well off its all-time highs. One of the stocks I added to my portfolio a while back due to lower prices wasBroadcom(AVGO0.54%), although its price today is lower than when I purchased it. I'd still consider adding to my position today, as it's an incredible AI company with a bright future. With any stock, I'm not concerned about what the stock price does a week or a month after I purchase it. Instead, I'm focusing on a three- to five-year time frame, and Broadcom's outlook during that period is quite strong. Broadcom has its fingers in many industries. Its products range from mainframe software to internet connectivity to storage systems. However, I'm most focused on its emerging product line for artificial intelligence (AI) model training. Broadcom is using its chip design expertise to assist companies in producing their own custom AI accelerators, which Broadcom calls XPUs. XPUs are similar tographics processing units (GPUs), which are still the most popular choice when it comes to training AI models. However, XPUs can outperform GPUs when the workload is properly set up. In the early days of AI training, the AI hyperscalers were all attempting to figure out the most efficient way to train these models. So, having a flexible computing device like a GPU was critical. Now, these hyperscalers have an idea of how to train their respective AI models, so building a device tailored to that computing method allows them to train AI models more efficiently. Furthermore, because the design work is done between Broadcom and its client, clients don't have to pay such sky-high premium as they do withNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA),¬†the current GPU leader that has made a massive profit from its devices. Broadcom's management team sees a massive market for these GPUs and other connectivity switches used in data centers. In its fiscal 2024, Broadcom generated $12.2 billion in revenue from this sector, up from $3.8 billion in 2023. However, management believes this segment could have an addressable market of $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal 2027, which would indicate massive growth. There's a key point in that $60 billion to $90 billion projection: It only comes from three clients. With two more hyperscalers slated to launch their XPUs this year and two more selecting Broadcom as a partner for their XPUs, this market range will dramatically expand from the current projection. Given that Broadcom generated $54.5 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, its revenue could easily double in the next three to five years from one product line alone. This is huge news for investors, as Broadcom's XPU growth is a way to invest in an AI hardware stock like Nvidia was at the start of 2023. Broadcom's stock trades for about26 times forward earningsfollowing the sell-off. Although that's a cheaper price than investors previously had to pay for Broadcom, it's still not cheaper than some of the other big tech stocks in the market.  AVGO PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts However, I think there's massive growth in store for Broadcom over the next few years as its business shifts to focusing on XPUs. As GPUs start to wear out, another demand cycle will appear for AI computing hardware. While not every GPU will be converted to an XPU, there will be some changeover, allowing Broadcom to expand its revenue base dramatically. If you can focus on the three- to five-year picture for Broadcom, it looks quite bright.¬†At its current price, Broadcom stock is still a no-brainer buy.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/meet-the-latest-supercharged-ai-stock-i-bought/?.tsrc=rss,4

The firm dismissedthe idea that AI is in a ""digestion phase"" as investor overreaction, calling recent demand trends anything but slow. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. Nvidia shares edged up in premarket trading following the report. Analyst Joseph Moore said that despite broader market concerns around macro trends and supply chains, demand for Nvidia's chips has accelerated, particularly inference GPUs used in artificial intelligence applications. He cited shortages across multiple large language model platforms worldwide as evidence that usage is intensifying. While Moore held his fiscal 2026 estimates due to export restrictions on the H20 chip, he raised his 2027 forecast significantly. He now expects revenue of $255.5 billion versus a prior $230.9 billion, and adjusted earnings of $6.01 per share, up from $5.37, fueled by ongoing data center strength. Moore noted that signals from companies like Open Router, as well as internal checks, show inference workloads are rising fast. He said the trend has remained solid even as headlines focus on trade disputes and geopolitical risk none of which appear to be slowing down actual usage. He also pointed to a surge in AI commentary across the tech community, with executives from OpenAI, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Grok weighing in on stronger demand signals. These public comments, combined with rising token generation volumes, have reinforced Morgan Stanley's more bullish stance. What's driving it all? Moore said this isn't hype-driven demand from venture-funded training experiments it's coming from actual business use cases generating revenue. That, he added, addresses one of the most persistent concerns around Nvidia's stock: that the AI boom might be inflated by speculative capital. He also pushed back on fears that China's chip stockpiling would dent Nvidia's near-term outlook. What we're seeing is broad-based growth across regions, Moore wrote, adding that constrained Blackwell supply and improving Hopper sales point to continued real-world scaling.

2025-04-25 15:40:11,Intel Shifts to In-House AI Development Amid Competitive Pressure from Nvidia and Cloud Giants,"Intel (INTC,Financials) isshifting awayfrom past acquisition bets and instead focusing on building its artificial intelligence capabilities in-house, Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan said Thursday, according toReuters. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC. Speaking during his first earnings call as CEO, Tan said Intel will develop a full-stack AI offeringchips, software, and systemssimilar to the model used by Nvidia (NVDA,Financials). He cautioned that the turnaround won't be immediate, calling the process not a quick fix,Reutersreported. Intel's pivot marks a departure from earlier efforts to grow in AI through acquisitions, including companies like Nervana, Movidius, and Habana Labs. Those deals failed to move the needle, though MobileyeIntel's autonomous driving unithas maintained a solid position following its spinoff, with Intel retaining a stake. The focus now is on refining Intel's existing products for applications such as robotics and task-based AI agents, while also developing edge computing chips to handle AI outside traditional data centers. According toReuters, Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said the company doesn't plan to pursue major acquisitions in the near future, citing balance sheet concerns. Analysts said Intel faces an uphill climb. Nvidia is far ahead, and tech giants like Amazon (AMZN,Financials) and Google (GOOGL,Financials) are designing their own AI chips, further crowding the field. Still, some believe Intel could carve out space if it can offer the right mix of hardware and software. If they can build strong software support around the chips, they've got a chance, analyst Bob O'Donnell toldReuters. But that's a big if.

2025-04-25 15:42:43,Nvidia Shares Climb After Morgan Stanley Hikes 2027 Forecast on Soaring AI Demand,"April 25- Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher on Friday morning, gainingnearly 1.5%, after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) raised its fiscal 2027 projections,citing surging global demand for artificial intelligence inference workloads, particularly in large language models. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The bank lifted its revenue estimate for fiscal 2027 to $255.5 billion, up from $230.9 billion, and raised its adjusted earnings forecast to $6.01 per share from $5.37. Analyst Joseph Moore attributed the upward revision to sustained momentum in Nvidia's data center segment and a sharp acceleration in inference usage. Moore noted that while macroeconomic and supply chain concerns persist, demand for inference chips is growing rapidly, especially amid a shortage affecting major AI models worldwide. He pointed to trends observed through OpenRouter and proprietary checks that suggest infrastructure stress due to a fivefold spike in AI token generation since the year began. High-profile voices in tech, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Tesla chief Elon Musk, have also highlighted the spike in AI workload usage in recent days. The analyst emphasized that the uptick is being driven by revenue-generating applications, not speculative training activity, providing a bullish signal for Nvidia's business fundamentals.

2025-04-25 15:58:55,"Former Cisco CEO John Chambers on tariffs: Yes, Apple can make iPhones in the US","Former Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers is no stranger to China's extensive, efficient tech supply chain. He was one of the first tech CEOs to tap the country for production of routers and other internet plumbing in the mid-1990s. But Apple (AAPL) could profitably make iPhones in the US amid high Chinesetariffsfrom the Trump administration. ""The answer is yes, yes, and yes,"" Chambers said on whether Apple CEO Tim Cook could pull off the move. On April 9, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on all reciprocal tariffs except for those on goods from China. Tariffs on one of the US's most important trading partners now stand at 145% ‚Äî a 125% reciprocal tariff and the 20% Trump previously levied. A 10% across-the-board duty is still being applied to all other imports. Watch:What Alcoa's former CEO says about Trump tariffs The administration further refined its tariff plans on April 11. The White House issued a rule that spared smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and other electronics from reciprocal tariffs, especially the harsher tariffs on Chinese goods. US Customs and Border Protection said the goods would be excluded from Trump's 10% global tariff and the 125% reciprocal Chinese tariffs. However, a 20% fentanyl tariff on Chinese goods still applies. The administration said it's eyeing a tariff on semiconductors. For Apple, the tariff policy could drive up prices on products such as iPhones, Macs, and AirPods, experts say. That could stunt demand and continue to weigh on Apple's stock, which is down 22% year to date. To circumvent a major tariff blow, Apple is reportedly eyeing India to make a large chunk of its products. ""If you look at the most strategic partnership to the US over this next decade, it will be India,"" said Chambers, who counts Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a longtime personal friend. ""So I think you will see iPhones being made in India, less in China, and you'll see iPhones being made in the US and strike the balance on it. So I think this is one where you will see us get very close to key allies. I think the most important strategic partnership we have in the world is with India, and I think you'll see them lay the groundwork for a good working relationship in resolving the tariff issues effectively."" Apple pledged in February toinvest $500 billionin the US, mostly tied to a new manufacturing facility in Houston to pump out servers that support Apple Intelligence. Absent from the commitment was anything related to making consumer hardware in the US. Listen:Intel's former CEO warns about Trump tariffs CEO Tim Cook said in a2015 interviewthat a skills gap in the US makes it difficult to produce Apple's products in the US. ""Look, you don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone,"" US Treasury SecretaryScott Bessent told me in an exclusive interview last weekwhen asked about Cook's prior comments.

2025-04-25 18:37:26,How Big Are Indian Family's Gold Holdings? Hint: It's More Than What's in Fort Knox,"Collectively, families across India have almost 25,000 tonnes of gold, making them the highest private owners of gold in the world. To put it in perspective, Indian families have a gold stash almost six times greater than the gold stored in Fort Knox. Gold serves various purposes in India. It is collected and kept as afinancial shieldshould economic turmoil arise, it is given as a gift at celebrations, and in rural areas, it takes the place of banking. As part of the cultural fabric, women collect gold jewelry, which is seen as a symbol of wealth, and it is often passed down from one generation to the next. And atweddings, gold jewelry is given to the bride, and gold bars are presented to the happy couple. Despite its importance in Indian life, there are restrictions on how much gold individuals can hold. According toincome taxlaws in India, married women are allowed to hold as much as 500 grams of gold. For unmarried women, this amount is lower, at 250 grams. Indian men may only hold up to 100 grams of gold. The total discovered gold in human history. In addition to its cultural importance in India, gold serves as a financial investment worldwide. It is often seen as an economic hedge when markets tumble. The price of gold as of April 25, 2025, is $3,305.70 per ounce. This is up from $2,331.71 per ounce in April 2024. Gold has been a solidinvestmentover the past 17 years. In April 2008, the price of gold was $1,354.54 per ounce, a triple-digit increase compared with today's price. However, gold is also a highly speculative asset with volatile price shifts and doesn't provide interest or dividends. Owning physical gold also comes with security and storage demands. Beyond owning bars or jewelry, gold investments can include exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks in gold mining operations. Indian families, particularly Indian women, are large holders of gold. This precious metal has a significant cultural meaning for Indian people, as they gift gold at weddings and pass it down from generation to generation. Gold also serves as a financial means of protection in difficult economic times, as it does throughout the rest of the world.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/amount-of-indian-familys-gold-holdings-11703898,3

Shares of the chipmaker were lifted afterMorgan Stanleyraised its revenue projections for the company as well as the revelation of some positive news in the ongoing trade war with China. This legendary investment bank updated its 2027 projections for Nvidia. Analyst Joseph Moore is now forecasting total revenue for 2027 of $255.5 billion. That's up from his previous projection of $230.9 billion. He also raised hisearnings per share (EPS)projections to $6.01 from $5.37. Even in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty, Moore cited growing demand for inference chips and AI demand. Inference, as opposed to training, refers to the computing that happens after an AI is trained. As AI tools grow in usage, demand for inference chips grows. As the trade war with China continues, some positive news emerged today. Although the country very publicly is refusing to negotiate with President Donald Trump unless he lowers U.S. tariffs, the country appears to have reduced its tariffs on semiconductors made in the U.S., according to a report from CNN business. Although Nvidia was already largely exempted because it mainly manufactures its chips in Taiwan, the news is still positive for the company because in contrast to its public messaging, it indicates China is ready to play ball, so to speak. The lowering of trade tensions between the U.S. and China can only help Nvidia's business.

Moreover, he does not believe that any of the companies will have much confidence in their outlooks, and he does not expect AI to be widely used until 2027. But in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, the veteran investor explained why he's quite bullish on NVDA. Nvidia Has a Low Valuation, Strong Demand NVDA ""never got to a stretched valuation,"" and the demand for its products remains ""voracious,"" Meeks believes. In general, the company should continue to deliver strong results, and the shares ""should be pretty attractive, even for value investors,"" Meeks contended. But he did warn that analysts' estimates for the company could drop ""a little"" as the large cloud-infrastructure companies reduce their AI outlays and the tariffs on China take a toll on NVDA. The Recent Performance of NVDA Stock In the last month, the shares have dropped 5%, while they are down 28% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Alphabet shares have trended lower within adescending channelthroughout most of this year, with the50-day moving average (MA)recently crossing below the 200-day MA to form an ominousdeath cross, a chart pattern that signal lower prices. However, the stock staged abreakoutabove the pattern‚Äôs upper trendline in Thursday‚Äôs trading session, which set the stage for today's post-earnings gain. Meanwhile, therelative strength index (RSI)flashes a neutral reading, but remains well belowoverboughtlevels, providing ample room for further upside. Let‚Äôs identify three crucial overhead areas on Alphabet‚Äôs chart where the shares may encounter overhead selling pressure and also locate a criticalsupport levelworth watching during possible retracements. The first area to monitor sits at $168. This location on the chart may provide overheadresistancenear a trendline that links multiplepeaks and troughson the chart extending back to late July last year. Buying above this level could see the price climb to around $182. Alphabet shares may run into sellers in this region near last November‚Äôsswing high, which closely aligns with theopening priceof astock gapin early December. The next overhead area of interest lies at the $196.

2025-04-25 19:43:18,Nvidia Stock Jumped Another 5% Today. Does It Have More Room to Run?,"Tariffs, trade policy, and the risk of recession have all contributed to market turmoil lately. That's led to a massive increase in volatility in one of the market's biggest stocks. Shares in tech giantNvidia(NVDA4.11%)have been rebounding sharply in recent days after a more than 20% drop over the last month. Nvidia shares dropped to as low as $95 in early April, but have rebounded to near $110 per share as this week's trading nears a close. Today alone the stock jumped 5% after President Donald Trump soothed investor fears of a trade war between the U.S. and China. Investors may now think they've missed the boat after that rebound, but shares of theartificial intelligence (AI) leadershould still have room to run. President Trump and his representatives have been cooling down rhetoric around tensions with China this week. At a financial forum in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said ""there is an opportunity for a big deal here,"" referring to a U.S. and China trade deal. While preparing to travel to Rome for Pope Francis' funeral today, President Trump good-naturedly told reporters he has spoken to China's President Xi ""many times."" That came after he said in aTimeinterview earlier in the week that he thought trade deals could be realized ""over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way."" Some of those comments may be strategic in nature, preparing for negotiations. But moving in that direction is good news for Nvidia and its shareholders. Nvidia reported sales of $17.1 billion in China forits fiscal yearended Jan. 26, 2025. That only represented 13% of revenue. But Nvidia has close ties to Taiwan as a supplier, and any turmoil could easily expand to include Taiwan. If business continues without major political interference, Nvidia shares could continue to rise. Watch for what it says about that when it reports its fiscal first quarter on May 28.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/nvidia-stock-jumped-another-5-today-trump-xi/?.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-25 20:11:02,Why Tesla Stock Just Had Its Best Week Since November,"Tesla (TSLA) stock posted its best week since November‚Äôs presidential election as investors looked ahead to a future with looser autonomous car regulations and a more focused CEO. Tesla shares soared nearly 10% on Friday after the Department of Transportation releasedan Automated Vehicle Frameworkintended to relax regulatory standards. The stock gained 18% this week, easily its best week this year and its biggest weekly gain since rising nearly 30% the weekDonald Trump was re-elected. Shares rose more than 4.5% on Tuesday amid a broad stock rally driven by optimism that the Trump administrationwill lower the steep tariff ratesit imposed earlier this month. The stock's ascent picked up pace on Wednesday after Musk assured investors that, starting in May, he wouldspend less timeleading President Trump‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency, a position that investors worry has bothdistracted Muskanddamaged Tesla‚Äôs brand. Musk‚Äôs decision to re-focus on Tesla offset otherwisebleak quarterly results. The electric vehicle maker reported a 20% decline in automotive revenue, narrower margins, and a nearly 40% decline in adjusted earnings. It also declined to issue full-year guidance in light of the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the overall economic outlook. In the near term, the company faces a bumpy road, with tariffs expected to drive up manufacturing costs and, in the event of a recession, curb consumer spending. The company could also struggle to shake its association with President Trump, whose unpopularity abroad has contributed toa sharp dropin Tesla sales even as total EV sales have risen. Analysts at several firms, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, lowered their estimates of Tesla‚Äôs full-year earnings after Tuesday‚Äôs disappointing numbers. At the same time, severalleft their price targets unchanged, reflecting Wall Street‚Äôs faith in Tesla‚Äôs ability to overcome near-term headwinds. Musk has said Tesla‚Äôs value‚Äîhe has forecast it will be ‚Äúthe most valuable company in the worldand probably by a long shot‚Äù‚Äîhas as much, if not more, to do with its development of AI, autonomous driving, and robotics than the electric vehicles that account for the bulk of its revenue today.

2025-04-25 20:34:34,Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Invest in for Long Term?,"We recently published a list of10 Best Stocks to Invest in for Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to invest in for long term. The markets have had two monster years with the S&P 500 index surging 24.73% and 24.01% in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index increased by a whopping 54.9% and 27.01% during the same periods. This was on the back of an AI boom, which benefitted the stocks of big tech companies. However, policy uncertainties and the risk of a stagflation, where inflation remains high without a significant economic growth, have caused a downtrend in those markets in 2025. CNBC recently interviewed Souls‚Äô Dan Greenhaus, Robinhood‚Äôs Stephanie Guild, and Invesco‚Äôs Brian Levitt. Greenhaus suggested that a lot of the worse-case scenarios have been priced into the market. While he conceded that he still remains cautious, he feels that the effects of the tariffs on inflation may not be as dire as most people think.¬† This is in line with a Morgan Stanley research which suggested that while the worst may be over, the coast is not clear yet. However, Stephanie Guild and Brian Levitt are a bit more cautious. Levitt added that he sees uncertainty persisting for longer, which means that volatility is likely to persist. According to Greenhaus, there are times of persistent uncertainty, that cause the risk premium on assets to rise, and present long-term opportunities. However, Levitt pointed out that S&P 500 valuations still remain elevated and are not at prior recession levels. Whereas Guild added that market expectations remain quite high, despite the uncertainty. She said that earnings growth expectations are at 11% and suggested that there is room for earning misses given the risks to the economy, which, in turn, could cause the markets to fall. While the market is probably going to remain risk-off for a bit, it is likely to offer great discounts on some of the best stocks in the market, sooner or later. Some companies with long runways are already trading at multi-year low levels. Also, these companies with good balance sheets should be able to navigate through a recession, if we were to enter into one, with ease. We sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the best stocks to invest in for the long-term. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds.

2025-04-25 20:36:21,Electronic Arts Stock Works Its Way Back From January's Tumble,"Shares of video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) have fought their way back after plummeting earlier this year. Shares of EA finished Friday a bit under $147 as Oppenheimer analysts called for them to keep rising. Theinvestment bankraised its price target to $170 from $140 in a Friday note, well above the Visible Alpha average of Wall Street analysts near $144 and one of the highest around.The latest move has the shares roughly flat for the year, marking a climb off January lows below $120 driven bya worrisome outlook. Oppenheimer in part credited the new Premium Pass in the EA Sports FC franchise for its bullish outlook, as an analyst said in the note that the firm expects the feature to ‚Äúprovide incremental, multi-year bookings growth tailwind previously unexpected by investors.‚Äù The analysts said the pass has proven to be amonetizationtool that works for games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, Valorant, and Overwatch 2, as it is often incremental to other monetization models, like premium in-game items, and it gives developers more control over user engagement and in-game economy. Oppenheimer said its bullish estimate could prove to be too aggressive if the console-refresh cycle fails to meet investor expectations over the next few years, if sales of older games fall at a higher rate than their replacements' growth, or if EA can't continue to tightly manage itsoperating expenses. ‚ÄúWhile EA enjoys successful evergreen [video game] properties like Madden NFL and FIFA, future growth will suffer if consumer perception of microtransactions turns negative,‚Äù the report also said.

2025-04-25 21:00:00,Could Nvidia's Sales Drop 30% due to a Trade War Between the U.S. and China?,"It's been a rough year forNvidia(NVDA4.11%). Since 2025 began, Nvidia's stock has fallen by more than 30%, shedding more than $1 trillion in value off the company's market cap. Yet Nvidia's end markets are still growing by leaps and bounds, especially when it comes to data center revenue tied to the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Investors looking for a rebound, however, should take caution. Up to 30% of the company's revenues could be at risk this year due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. If you're betting on Nvidia, you need to understand what's at risk. Earlier this month, Nvidia revealed that it may be forced to take a $5.5 billion charge related to H20 chips intended for sale in China. New rules may require the firm to obtain licenses to export these AI chips to China. According to the BBC, Nvidia was told that the license requirement ""addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China."" Nvidia's management team was also told that these new rules ""will be in effect for the indefinite future."" When looking at the latest filings, roughly 14% of Nvidia's sales last quarter stemmed from China. Losing this sales base would have a large negative effect, especially in light of Nvidia's premium valuation. But this figure could actually be dramatically understating China's true contribution to Nvidia's revenue streams. Singapore, a neighboring country in Asia, accounts for a whopping 18% of Nvidia's current sales base -- even larger than China's contribution. Yet less than 2% of these sales actually export to Singapore as their end destination. ""Customers use Singapore to centralize invoicing while our products are almost always shipped elsewhere,"" Nvidia's management team has clarified. Last month, it was found that many of these shipments ended up in China, meaning China's true share of Nvidia's sales base could be as high as 30%.  NVDA PS Ratiodata byYCharts. With new licenses being required to export its H20 chips, Nvidia will likely take an immediate multibillion dollar charge next month when its quarter closes. According to recent reporting, Chinese firms have placed more than $16 billion in orders for Nvidia's H20 chips over the 90 days of 2025 alone. All of these sales are now at risk. Meanwhile, local Chinese competitors like Huawei are investing heavily to expand their ability to replace Nvidia's lost sales base. The end result could see Nvidia losing considerable market share in the country, even if recent rules are rolled back. That's especially true given the Chinese government has been increasingly vocal about reducing its dependence on foreign chipmakers. While Nvidia's sales base won't fall by 30% overnight, this is clearly a growing headwind for the company. At the start of 2025, shares were priced at 30 times sales despite a multitrillion dollar valuation, leaving little room for error. After losing around one-third of its value during the 2025 market correction, however, Nvidia's shares are now priced at just 18.4 times trailing sales and 11.7 times forward sales. It's possible that the threat to its Chinese sales base has already been priced in. But as the second-largest consumer of artificial intelligence graphics processing units (AI GPUs), losing China as a customer would be a long-term blow to Nvidia's growth prospects. This headwind is critical to watch for Nvidia investors moving forward.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/25/nvidia-sales-drop-trade-war-china-nvda/?.tsrc=rss,4

Meanwhile, President Trump indicated that tariffs on imports from China will remain in place unless the U.S. receives concessions from its major trading partner. The S&P 500 advanced 0.7%, extending its winning streak to four consecutive sessions, while another strong trading day for the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq 1.3%. After fluctuating for most of the day, the Dow ended with a slight gain of less than 0.1%. Shares of cable, internet, and telephone services provider Charter Communications (CHTR) surged 11.4%, logging the S&P 500's top daily performance.

2025-04-25 21:40:00,Stashing Cash While You Wait for Trump's Tariffs to Shake Out? Today's Top Safe Havens Pay Up to 5.00%,"The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Giventhe economic rollercoaster triggeredby President Trump's continually evolving tariff policy, boosting the cash you have in reserve seems wise. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or shifting funds from stocks into cash vehicles, it's important to consider how much you can earn from different strategies. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category, indicating the change from a week ago. Right now you can earn the highest rate with ahigh-yield savings account, with two options paying 5.00%. However, those two leaders have some special requirements that might not suit your needs, with 4.60% being the top high-yield savings rate with ""no strings attached."" Savings and money market account rates can drop at any time, however. To ensure you earn today's rates for months or even years into the future,consider a CD instead. The top rate there is also 4.60%, for terms of 6 to 10 months. Or you can lock in a slightly lower APY that will be guaranteed for longer. Rates on brokerage money market funds and cash management accounts showed little change this week, while rates on Treasurys held mostly steady in the shorter durations but declined somewhat among longer bonds. The rates below are the top nationally available APYs from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed, but can change at any time. Treasury securities pay their rate through maturity and can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect, or can be bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage. I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirect and can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account‚Äîsometimes called ahigh-yield savings account‚Äîthat lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you18 options paying 4.35% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type‚Äîmoney market or savings‚Äîpays the better rate. Thetop money market account rate is currently 4.40% APY. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includesoptions paying up to 4.60% APY. Note that the ""top rates"" quoted for savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research of hundreds of banks and credit unions. These are very different from the national averages, comprising all institutions offering accounts of those types‚Äîincluding many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, national averages are always low, while the top rates we present are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.96% to 4.22% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds ""swept"" into a cash management account where it will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- to 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.74% to 4.75%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsdirectly fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect‚Äîthe U.S. Treasury‚Äôs online platform for buying federal government securities‚Äîhas no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. Every six months you own the bond, your rate will change. I bond rates will go up on May 1. While we don't know the exact rate Treasury will announce that day fornewbonds, we know that for existing I bond holders, your next six-month rate will increase by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe upcoming rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

I mean, it‚Äôs a tax,‚Äù Cohen said Friday at the FII Priority Summit in Miami Beach, Florida. ‚ÄúOn top of that, we have slowing immigration, which means the labor force will not grow as rapidly as ‚Ä¶ the last five years and so.‚Äù Cohen has warned that the good times that saw the equity market trickle to record highs are over as the US economy‚Äôs outlook is uncertain due to the tariff plan laid out by Trump. True to Cohen‚Äôs warnings, the US stock market has pulled back significantly from record highs. Given the uncertain macro environment, the S&P 500 is already down by about 8% for the year and on the cusp of entering the correcting phase. Echoing similar sentiments is Morgan Stanley CIO Mike Wilson, who insists a significant correction has been on the cards since 2023. According to Wilson, investors had pushed stocks upwards, with valuation skyrocketing above historical norms and beyond the value of their fundamentals. Therefore, a rapid descent should be expected as headwinds soar left, right and centre. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually pretty negative for the first time in a while,‚Äù Cohen said. ‚ÄúIt may only last a year or so, but it‚Äôs definitely a period where I think the best gains have been had and wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to see a significant correction.‚Äù On the other hand, Cohen remains optimistic about the artificial intelligence outlook despite DeepSeek‚Äôs revelation and development on the development of cost-effective AI models rattling the US markets. According to Cohen, DeepSeek‚Äôs development of cost-effective AI models is positive despite raising concerns about spending on powerful AI chips developed by US companies. Cohen is one of the billionaire investors taking advantage of the artificial intelligence boom through strategic investments. His portfolio at Point72 Asset Management hedge boasts significant exposure to tech giants developing and leveraging various AI innovations. Likewise, Point72 Asset Management has already unveiled a new artificial intelligence-focused fund that posted a 14% gain in the last three months of 2024 growing to $1.5 billion. We combed Point 72 SEC Q4 2024 13F filings to identify billionaire Steve Cohen‚Äôs 10 large-cap stock picks with huge upside potential. We focused on stocks with a market cap of more than $40 billion with significant upside potential. We then analyzed the stocks on why they stand out as solid investments well poised to generate significant value even on the overall equity market turning bearish. Finally, we listed the stocks in ascending order of upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management Market Cap as of April 24: $2.51 Trillion Point72 Asset Management‚Äôs Equity Stake: $562.55 Million Analysts‚Äô Upside Potential as of April 24: 64.04% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and develops the most advanced chip systems and software for artificial intelligence. It also provides graphics computing and networking solutions for data centre computing platforms and end-to-end networking platforms. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been under pressure as the company remains the subject of trade tariffs and export control curbs. Likewise, analysts at Citi have lowered their stock price target to $163 from $150, concerned by a slowdown in data center spending in the US. Rising competition in the AI chip market and a significant increase in manufacturing costs due to trade wars are other headwinds. Management has already reiterated that new US controls on exports of artificial intelligence chips will cost the company about $5.5 billion. The US government has already informed the company that it will bid for a special license to export its H20 chips made specifically for Chinese markets. Since 2022, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has produced a number of specific chips for Chinese clients, including the A800, H800 and the H800‚Äôs successor. The company has had to develop Chinese-specific chips to adhere to US regulations that seek to limit China‚Äôs access to hardware required for AI innovation. The focus on China does not come as a surprise, as the Chinese market accounted for 13% or $17 billion of Nvidia‚Äôs revenue in its fiscal year 2025. Overall, NVDAranks 1ston our list of billionaire Steve Cohen‚Äôs large-cap stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

2025-04-26 08:18:00,Is Nvidia an Undervalued Growth Stock or a Falling Knife?,"Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)was one of the market's hottest growth stocks of the past decade. From the first trading day of 2014 to the last trading day of 2024, its stock surged 33,430%. From fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2025, which ended in January, its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39% as its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 58%. That breakneck growth was initially driven by its brisk sales of graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming, which were also used for professional graphics production and cryptocurrency mining. But over the past few years, its data center GPU sales skyrocketed as thegenerative AImarket exploded. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia's data center GPUs can process artificial intelligence (AI) tasks much faster than standalone CPUs, so all of the world's top AI companies -- including OpenAI,Microsoft, andAlphabet's Google -- use its chips. As the leading seller of the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Nvidia naturally became the bellwether of that booming market. However, Nvidia's stock has declined about 23% this year as the Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs, the intensifying trade war, and other macroeconomic headwinds drove investors toward more conservative investments. Let's see if Nvidia's becoming an undervalued growth stock after that pullback -- or if it's a falling knife which could cut bargain-seeking investors. In fiscal 2025, Nvidia's revenue rose 114%, its adjusted gross margin expanded 170 basis points to 75.5%, and its adjusted EPS increased 130%. Most of that growth was driven by its data center revenue, which surged 142% to $115 billion and accounted for 88% of its top line. Those growth rates are explosive, but Nvidia's quarterly numbers reveal two near-term issues: Its year-over-year growth rates are slowing down, and its gross margin is slipping sequentially. Metric Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Q3 2025 Q4 2025 Total revenue growth (YOY) 265% 262% 122% 94% 78% Data center revenue growth (YOY) 409% 427% 154% 112% 93% Adjusted gross margin 76.7% 78.9% 75.7% 75% 73.5% Adjusted EPS growth (YOY) 486% 461% 152% 103% 71% Data source: Nvidia. YOY = Year over year. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia expects its revenue to rise 44% year over year as its adjusted gross margin dips to a midpoint of 71%. For the full year, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 54% and 48%, respectively, as the AI market continues to expand and it ramps up its production of its newest Blackwell GPUs. Nvidia is still growing like a weed, but the bears think its slowdown will worsen as the red-hot AI market finally cools off. Four challenges could throttle its near-term growth: the export curbs against China, higher tariffs that could drive it to manufacture its newest chips at lower margins in America, slower AI spending in a challenging macro environment, and competition from cheaper data center GPUs fromAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD2.30%), Huawei, and other chipmakers. In Nvidia's latestconference callin February, CEO Jensen Huang brushed aside those concerns and said it was ""fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream and that it's being integrated into every application."" Huang noted that while its revenue in China was roughly cut in half by the export curbs, the region's weight on its top line fell from 17% in fiscal 2024 to just 13% in fiscal 2025. Therefore, the strength of Nvidia's other markets should offset the pressure from its export curbs and tariffs in China. Nvidia's growth is gradually slowing down, and its gross and operating margins could be compressed in this challenging and unpredictable macro environment. But at $103 a share, it still looks cheap at 23 times forward earnings. AMD, which is growing at a slower clip, has a forwardprice-to-earningsratio of 19. Nvidia controls about 98% of the data center GPU market, according to TechInsights, and it should remain well ahead of its smaller and less sophisticated competitors. It also locks a lot of AI developers into its proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture platform for GPU applications, which can't be natively accessed by other data center GPUs. So if you believe Nvidia will remain at the top of this booming market, then its stock still looks undervalued. It could remain volatile over the next few quarters, but investors who accumulate it through those swings could be well rewarded in the future.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/is-nvidia-an-undervalued-growth-stock-or-a-falling/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-26 09:00:00,What Analysts Think of Meta Platforms Stock Ahead of Earnings,"Meta Platforms (META) is set to report first-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday, and analysts have remained bullish on the Facebook parent amid tariff uncertainty and legal disputes. Of the 27 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, 25 call Meta a ""buy,"" while just two have a ""hold"" rating. The stock has an average price target near $695, a roughly 27% premium to Friday's closing level of about $547. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is expected to reportearnings per shareof $5.24 on revenue of $41.35 billion, which would represent 11% and 13% growth, respectively, froma year ago. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote recently that Meta could be hurt by a tariff-fueled pullback in advertising from Chinese companies, but said the firm should be better positioned to withstand that than Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google or Amazon (AMZN). Legal and regulatory disputes havenagged Meta, with theEuropean Unionthis week fining the tech giant200 million euros($227.5 million) for violating its Digital Markets Act. Meta said it plans to appeal the fine. Also this month, Meta'santitrust trialbegan. TheFederal Trade Commissionis looking to make the company sell or spin off Instagram or WhatsApp, and the agency has said that Meta engaged in an ""illegal buy-or-bury scheme to maintain its dominance"" by acquiring the ""innovative competitors.""

2025-04-26 09:00:00,This Event Could Be the Next Catalyst for Intel's Stock,"Shares of Intel (INTC) finished the week on a down note after its latest financial outlook disappointed investors. The stock‚Äôs next catalyst might be just a few days away. Lip-Bu Tan, who presided over thechip company‚Äôs quarterly resultsThursday for the first time as CEO, will on Tuesday give the keynote address at an event associated with Intel‚Äôs Foundry business, which makes chips for other companies.Bank of America analysts in a Friday note said the event could be paired with the announcement of partnerships with other big tech firms. Intel has sought to grow the Foundry business; early last year, itspoke of ambitionsto be the world‚Äôs second-largest foundry behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) by 2030. Its 2024 foundry revenue, however, fell from a year earlier‚Äîit came in north of $17 billion, roughly 30% of the company‚Äôs total‚Äîand its operating loss widened. This year reports have suggested that Intel might look to sell a stake in the Foundry operation to TSMC; that company, however,has denied talks. Investors were tracking the possibility that a spinoff or sale of Foundry might be in the works wellbefore Tan took over. Investors continue to look for signs of dealmaking. Optimism about a range of possibilities, ranging all the way up to a sale of the entire company, has moved the shares in recent months. That could still be the case. But Tan has said cost-cutting is also a priority: On Thursday, while not formally announcing layoff plansreported earlier in the week, he made clearthey are coming. Bank of America analysts, who have a neutral rating for Intel's stock and a $23 price target that is a few cents above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, said Intel is ‚Äútoo big to turn around quickly, but optionality [is] still there.‚Äù The stock has lost over a third of its value in the past year through Friday's close.",News,https://www.investopedia.com/this-event-could-be-the-next-catalyst-for-intel-stock-11722067,3
2025-04-26 09:00:00,"Better Buy Now: Gold at $3,500 or an S&P 500 Index Fund?","The price of gold is hitting new all-time highs -- surpassing $3,500 per ounce. Meanwhile, theS&P 500(^GSPC0.74%)is in a correction. Some investors may be wondering if it is better at the moment to buy the dip in the S&P 500 or ride the gold wave higher. Below I'll discuss why gold is doing so well, different ways to invest in gold -- including through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- and if gold is a better buy than anS&P 500 index fund. Image source: Getty Images. Gold prices are up over 30% year to date at the time of this writing, compared to a 12.3% sell-off in the S&P 500. Its price performance also slightly beat the S&P 500 in 2024. Gold has been so hot that it's up more than the S&P 500 over the last three-year, five-year, and 10-year periods -- although the S&P 500 is beating it over the last five-year and 10-year periods when you account for dividends reinvested. Still, gold's torrid run-up may come as a surprise, especially given the strong gains in the S&P 500 led by megacap growth stocks. It wasn't long ago that investors questioned when the first U.S. company would surpass $1 trillion in market cap.Apple,Microsoft, andNvidiaall closed out 2024 with market caps over $3 trillion. Gold has made most of its gains over the S&P 500 during the last three years (there were two major sell-offs in the S&P 500 -- in 2022 and now in 2025) thanks to its steady rise in that time. Even with dividends included, theVanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO0.75%)is massively underperforming theSPDR Gold Shares ETF(GLD-1.04%)fund over the last three years.  Data byYCharts. The S&P 500 generally is driven higher by earnings and investor sentiment, and higher earnings justify higher stock prices. When sentiment is positive, investors may be willing to pay more for stocks, based on future earnings expectations. Gold is based on supply and demand. It's a commodity, not a company. Lower interest rates can reduce borrowing costs and drive gold prices higher. However, geopolitical uncertainty is an even greater catalyst for higher gold prices. Tariff tensions, the threat of trade wars, and President Donald Trump's attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell can weaken confidence in U.S. markets and potentially jeopardize their credibility. As a result, fearful investors around the world may turn away from U.S. stocks toward gold. Another driving factor is the People's Bank of China -- thelargest official sector buyer of gold in 2023 and 2024. Reports indicate that the central bank boosted its gold reserves for the fifth consecutive month in March. In sum, there are valid near-term factors driving gold prices higher. However, that doesn't mean investors should dump stocks in favor of gold. Buying gold through jewelry, coins, or bullion comes with storage and security risks. The most straightforward and liquid way to buy and sell gold is through an ETF, such as the SPDR Gold Shares. The fund uses a custodian that holds physical gold on its behalf, with the fund passing along a 0.4% expense ratio as a fee for its services. By comparison, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF charges a mere 0.03% expense ratio. The better buy now depends on your investment objectives and existing holdings. If you're looking to add a new asset class to your portfolio that can perform well, even if geopolitical tensions persist, then gold could be worth a closer look. However, if you're looking to invest in a variety of companies under the simplicity of one tradable ticker, then an S&P 500 index fund may be a better fit. Another factor worth considering is what makes up the S&P 500. A whopping 35% of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is invested in just 10 companies -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia,Amazon,Alphabet,Meta Platforms,Berkshire Hathaway,Broadcom,Tesla, andJPMorgan Chase. If you already own sizable positions in these companies, then buying an S&P 500 index fund may not achieve the level of diversification you're looking for. There are plenty of low-cost ETFs out there thatdon't include these megacap namesor are less top-heavy. However, if you're looking for broad-based exposure to the market, then an S&P 500 index fund is a good starting point. Gold has been on a tear in recent years, which has bridged the gap between gold's gains and the S&P 500 over the last decade. However, for most investors, it's probably best that gold serve more as a role player in a diversified portfolio, rather than the focal point. Gold could fall or underperform the S&P 500 if the supply/demand imbalance changes. It's also more difficult to analyze because it isn't based on business fundamentals. Another factor worth considering is that there aren't dividends on gold ETFs, whereas S&P 500 index funds and plenty of other equity-based ETFs have dividends, which providepassive income no matter what the market is doing. Ultimately, the amount of gold to include in a portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and what you already own. Investors with ultra-long-term time horizons may be better off keeping gold exposure to a minimum, especially given the long-term opportunity cost of investing in gold instead of the stock market. However, the near-term catalysts for gold are undeniable, so it makes sense that gold is crushing the S&P 500 year to date.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/better-buy-now-gold-or-an-sp-500-index-fund/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-26 09:07:00,"Members of Congress Are Buying This Beaten-Down ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock (Hint: It's Not Nvidia or Tesla)","The U.S. Congress might not be the place you want to look for guidance on anything financial-related. After all, the national debt is over $36.7 trillion and growing, and every penny of the money spent by the federal government had to be approved by Congress. On the other hand, quite a few individual congressional representatives and senators have made some excellent stock picks through the years. Following their trades has become a pastime for some investors looking for stocks to buy. It doesn't make sense to mimic anyone's stock trades without thought, but Congress can be a place to find stocks worth checking out. While the so-called""Magnificent Seven"" stocksaren't very magnificent in 2025 so far, several members of the group remain popular on Capitol Hill. Members of Congress are especially buying one beaten-down Magnificent Seven stock. NvidiaandTeslahave taken the worst shellacking among the Magnificent Seven stocks this year. Nvidia's shares are down more than 30% from the peak set earlier in 2025, while Tesla's shares have plunged more than 40%. So, do these two rank among the favorite Magnificent Seven stocks of Congress right now? Nope. Representatives and senators have sold Nvidia and Tesla more often than they've bought the stocks over the last 90 days, according to data at capitoltrades.com. It's a similar story forApple, Google parentAlphabet, andMicrosoft. Members of Congress have bought shares ofMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META)more than they've sold the stock. However, their favorite Magnificent Seven stock based on net buying versus selling these days isAmazon(AMZN1.35%). The stock of the e-commerce and cloud services giant has enjoyed bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. Democratic representatives Dwight Evans of Pennsylvania and Ro Khanna of California have bought Amazon stock over the last 90 days (including four separate purchases for Khanna). Four GOP House members -- Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Scott Franklin of Florida, David Taylor of Ohio, and Thomas Kean Jr. of New Jersey -- picked up shares of Amazon. So have two Republican senators, John Boozman of Arkansas and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma. Federal regulations require members of Congress to disclose their stock trades, but not the reason behind them. We don't know why any of these people bought Amazon stock. However, we can make a pretty good guess as to why Amazon has been so appealing to multiple representatives and senators. It likely appeals to them for the same reasons it appeals to all kinds of investors. Amazon's business remains rock-solid. The company raked in revenue of $638 billion last year. Its profits totaled $59.2 billion, a greater amount than the market caps of over two-thirds of stocks in theS&P 500. Growth isn't a problem for Amazon, either. The rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) continues to provide a seemingly unstoppable tailwind for its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Amazon Prime membership program has proven to be a cash cow that attracts consumers to the company's e-commerce platform. One knock against Amazon stock in the past has been its sky-high valuation. That's not nearly as much of an issue now, though, with the stock'sprice-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratioat 1.3. Granted, President Donald Trump's tariffs could take a toll on Amazon over the near term. The good news on that front, however, is that cost-conscious consumers should still purchase heavily from Amazon. The company recently launched Amazon Haul, which offers ultra-low prices. Don't buy any stock solely because a politician bought it. For that matter, don't sell a stock just because a politician¬† sold it. However, I think the Democrats and Republicans who bought Amazon in recent weeks made smart moves, if they hold onto their shares. The current pullback presents a tremendous opportunity for long-term investors to buy Amazon at a discount. I expect AWS to continue to deliver strong growth as AI adoption rises. I predict Amazon's efforts to improve operational efficiency will keep driving profits higher. And I think the company's expansion initiatives into healthcare, satellite internet, and other areas will pay off.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/members-of-congress-are-buying-this-beaten-down-ma/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-26 11:00:00,Nvidia Is Nearly Cheaper Than the S&P 500 Using This 1 Important Metric. Is It Time to Buy?,"Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)has been notorious for being a high-growth, highly valued stock since its run began in early 2023. However, that's no longer the case using this one common and important evaluation metric. Now, it's nearly the same price as theS&P 500(^GSPC0.74%), which is an odd thing to say considering how much growth Nvidia is expected to put up over the next few years. However, this metric has one important consideration, and it could be giving investors false hope. The valuation metric that I most like to use -- and the one that's relevant in this discussion -- is theforward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. By definition, forward earnings haven't been achieved yet; they're just projections. As a result, they are inherently flawed because these predictions rarely come true. Furthermore, because the forward P/E ratio uses multiple analyst projections to come up with an average value, not every one of them can be right. But the average of all of them gives investors an idea of where the company's earnings could be heading, which is important considering how the market works. The market isn't a rearward-looking entity. If it were, then tariff concerns wouldn't affect the stock market because it would only be looking at the past when tariffs weren't an issue. This is why thetrailing P/E ratiois somewhat irrelevant (in my opinion) because it looks at where the stock has been, not where it's going. Still, the trailing P/E ratio can be a useful metric in conjunction with the forward P/E, as investors need to make sure earnings aren't going to fall off a cliff in future quarters. The forward P/E ratio is especially useful for high-growth companies like Nvidia, as valuing it on trailing earnings when monster growth is expected in the next few quarters isn't a wise move. From this standpoint, Nvidia has nearly reached the same level as the S&P 500.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At 22.4 times forward earnings, Nvidia is only slightly more expensive than the S&P 500's 19.8 times forward earnings valuation. This is despite the fact that Wall Street analysts project 54% revenue growth in FY 2026 (ending January 2026) and 23% growth in FY 2027. However, this price could be artificially low, as analysts might be waiting for Nvidia to report first quarter earnings before adjusting their projections. There are plenty of fears surrounding Nvidia, especially with tariffs looming. But is this enough to avoid the stock? Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)have become the go-to computing components for training and running AI models. As more computing power is needed for these models, Nvidia will sell more. However, some AI hyperscalers have been slowing their data center expansion plans. None of these reports jive with what their management said just a few weeks ago, and they don't fit with what critical supplierTaiwan Semiconductor(TSM0.57%)stated. In TSMC's Q1 results, its CEO noted, ""We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies. However, we have not seen any change in our customers' behavior so far."" Nvidia uses TSMC's foundry to produce its chips, which clearly indicates that Nvidia hasn't canceled a bunch of its chip orders from TSMC yet. That doesn't mean there won't be a slowdown, but the market is currently assuming the worst-case scenario for Nvidia's business, which is why the stock is down so much. As a result, I think right now represents an excellent buying opportunity, as long as you can stay patient with the stock for three to five years. If you can, there's ahigh probability that Nvidia will crush the market over that time frame.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/nvidia-is-nearly-cheaper-than-the-sp-500-using-thi/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-26 12:13:45,Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Most Promising Stock According to Analysts?,"We recently published a list of the11 Most Promising Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other promising stocks. On April 23, Stephen Parker, JPMorgan Private Bank co-head of global investment strategy, joined ‚ÄòSquawk Box‚Äô on CNBC to express that investors should have a normal level of risk in their portfolios right now. Parker explained that while he is fully in support of remaining invested in the market, he does recommend clients to stay focused on sectors that may be more resilient in a downturn to help protect against losses while staying long. His baseline guidance is for clients to maintain a normal level of risk in their portfolios. Those holding too much cash should get invested, and those overexposed to US markets and the dollar should consider adding non-US exposure. He advised that this is a period where investors must be comfortable with discomfort, as policy uncertainty broadens the range of possible outcomes. Parker acknowledged that while downside risks are top of mind for many investors, there is also upside potential, especially if there are positive policy surprises, such as clarity on tariffs, which could drive markets back to their highs sooner than expected. His outlook for the S&P 500 index is a wide range, with the high end being flat for the year and a possible range of 5,700-6,200. This reflects heightened policy uncertainty and difficulty in pinpointing a single target. Parker pointed out that even if it takes two years for markets to return to all-time highs, an 8% annual return would still be compelling for equities.¬† Reflecting on the start of the year, he noted that market multiples were considered rich following 2 consecutive years of 20%+ gains. There was optimism around deregulation and changes to corporate taxes, but few expected the S&P 500 to remain flat for 2 years from a level of 6,200. Parker further explained that even without pro-business policy changes, the market may have faced challenges after such strong recent gains. The pullback in high-performing segments of the US market has brought valuations closer to what he considers normal levels, which also sets the stage for potential upside. We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top stocks that had high analysts‚Äô upside potential (at least 35%). The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024, which was sourced from Insider Monkey‚Äôs database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 Average Upside Potential as of April 23: 62.87% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company that offers graphics and compute & networking solutions. It sells its products to various parties such as OEMs, original device manufacturers, system integrators & distributors, independent software vendors, cloud service providers, and consumer internet companies. On April 16, Mizuho Securities maintained its Outperform rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a $168 price target. Mizuho analysts are optimistic about the company‚Äôs near-term prospects, especially with the shipment of the GB200 series and increased testing capacity for more complex GPU racks. The analysts also highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)‚Äôs long-term capital expenditure in AI for the calendar year 2026. At CES 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled major innovations in AI, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. The new GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, powered by Blackwell, were launched in January and February. Blackwell is designed for AI inference, with 25x higher throughput and 20x lower cost than previous models. Blackwell sales reached $11 billion in FQ4 2025. Total revenue for FY25 reached $115.2 billion, which more than doubled year-over-year. Guinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024investor letter: ‚ÄúFor a second year running,NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund‚Äôs top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia‚Äôs ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‚ÄòHopper‚Äô GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia‚Äôs extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to ‚Äúinference‚Äù (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia‚Äôs financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia‚Äôs data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia‚Äôs technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia‚Äôs valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 2ndon our list of the most promising stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

2025-04-26 12:25:00,2 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Tech stocks have taken investors on a wild ride in 2025, with tariffs, interest-rate jitters, and a new presidential administration fueling market volatility. But while many are running for the exits, savvy investors know that short-term chaos can create long-term opportunity. Here are a few of those stocks -- trading at significant discounts -- that are worth a closer look while Wall Street catches its breath. AppLovin(APP3.39%)provides technology and tools to help mobile app developers effectively market, monetize, and grow their apps.The stock trades recently traded around $270 per share and has increased by more than 300% since its initial public offering in 2021. Yet the stock is down roughly 23% in 2025, in part due to the investigative investment firm Muddy Waters Research releasing a short report on the company claimingthat AppLovin appears to be violating the platforms' terms of service. As a result, Muddy Waters believes AppLovin could lose business to competitors, claiming a 23% client churn rate in the first quarter 2025. AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi pushed back against the short report, describing it as ""littered with inaccuracies and false assertions."" Foroughi emphasized that the company operates in full compliance with App Store policies and stressed that its business is ""based on transparency and integrity."" AppLovin delivered strong financial results in 2024, generating $4.7 billion inrevenueand $2.1 billion infree cash flow-- marking year-over-year increases of 43.4% and 100%, respectively. The company has been putting its free cash flow to work by buying back stock, reducing its shares outstanding by 10% over the past three years. As of the end of 2024, it still has $2.3 billion remaining under its share repurchase program.  APP Price to Free Cash Flowdata byYCharts AppLovin's valuation may look steep at first glance -- trading at 43.6times free cash flow-- but high multiples are par for the course in the world of tech and growth stocks, where investors pay for future potential. What makes AppLovin stand out is its rapid growth: With free cash flow doubling in 2024, the premium looks far more palatable. Plus, the stock is currently trading about 50% below its peak price-to-free cash flow multiple, making this high-growth company look like a bargain. Arguably, at this stage of theartificial intelligence (AI)boom,Nvidia(NVDA4.11%), a chip supplier, has been the largest beneficiary. It provides the ecosystem of software and materials to support AI development.After its stock skyrocketed over the past few years, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable publicly traded company. Since then, the stock has cooled to $104 per share, falling more than 30% from its peak of $153 per share. Despite the price fluctuations, the business is humming along. In fiscal 2025, Nvidia generated $130.5 billion in revenue and $72.9 billion innet income, representing an incredible increase of 114% and 145%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2024. One reason for the recent dip in Nvidia's stock is growing uncertainty around tariffs, which could pressure the company's highgross margin. Nvidia's gross margin, a key indicator of cost efficiency and pricing power, stood at 78.4% in fiscal Q1 2025, but management expects it to decrease to between 70.6% and 71% in fiscal Q1 2026. If that projection holds, it would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of margin contraction. Addressing the issue during the company's February earnings call, CFO Colette Kress acknowledged the uncertainty around tariffs, saying, ""It's a little bit of an unknown, it's an unknown until we understand further what the U.S. government's plan is, both its timing, it's where, and how much."" For a mature company like Nvidia, theprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioremains a widely used valuation tool, measuring a company's stock price relative to its earnings over the past 12 months. Currently, Nvidia trades at 35.6 times trailing earnings -- a figure that might seem steep to traditional value investors. However, when considering theforward P/E ratio, which reflects expectations for the next 12 months of earnings, the valuation appears far more attractive at 23.6 times earnings.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Looking further ahead, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's long-term optimism surrounding the AI revolution helps support the company's valuation. On the company's most recent earnings call, Huang outlined a sweeping vision for the role of AI, stating: Every fintech company will [use AI]. Climate tech companies use AI. Mineral discovery now uses AI ... every higher education, every university uses AI, and so I think it is fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream and that it's being integrated into every application. Whenever the market turns turbulent, growth stocks are often the first to take a hit -- and that's exactly what investors are seeing now. Both AppLovin and Nvidia have delivered explosive growth in recent years, resulting in premium valuations. But with the latest pullback, investors finally have a rare chance to scoop up shares at far more reasonable prices.¬†Given the long-term tailwinds behind mobile advertising for AppLovin and the surge of AI for Nvidia, this moment of market uncertainty could end up being a prime opportunity for investors who can look beyond the next few quarters and focus on the long term.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/2-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/?.tsrc=rss,4

2025-04-26 13:15:00,Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Rigetti Computing vs. Nvidia,"Two popular stocks among tech investors lately areRigetti Computing(RGTI0.86%), which makes quantum computing hardware and software, and the semiconductor companyNvidia(NVDA4.11%). While Nvidia is a much more direct bet on the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market, Rigetti's quantum computing systems are integrated into some existing AI. Both stocks have soared, too, with Rigetti up 34% and Nvidia skyrocketing 342% over the past three years, compared to theS&P 500's 15% rise. But, which is the betterAI stockfor long-term investors? Let's take a look. Image source: Getty Images. If you're in the market for an AI stock, it's hard to beatNvidia. All major global tech companies have ramped up their data center spending over the past few years as they compete for artificial intelligence dominance. That's led to a bonanza of data center spending and rising demand for the processors in them. The result has been a boon for Nvidia's chip sales. Revenue from its data center segment soared 142% in fiscal 2025 to $115 billion, and the company's non-GAAP earnings soared 130% to $2.99 per share. It's also given Nvidia a massive lead in the AI data center processing space, with an estimated 70% to 95% market share. And the AI boom isn't over yet. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks tech companies will invest $2 trillion in AI data center spending over the next few years, which could lead to even more demand for Nvidia's advanced processors. The company is well-positioned to benefit from its latest AI processor, Blackwell, which has already spurred strong demand from tech giants and resulted in $11 billion in sales, the company's ""fastest product ramp."" Quantum computingoffers investors a compelling opportunity because the ramifications of the technology could advance everything from materials science to disease prevention and climate science. Unlike traditional computers, which process bits as either 0s or 1s, quantum computers use qubits, which can be either 0 or 1, or both simultaneously. That allows them to scale hypothetical scenarios much faster than traditional computers, although sometimes at the cost of making more mistakes. Rigetti makes hardware, software, and quantum cloud computing systems that tap into the massive potential of this market, which could be worth $170 billion by 2040. Rigetti's comprehensive approach to quantum computing is attractive to investors. It also partnered with some heavy hitters in the cloud space, includingAmazonandMicrosoft, giving Rigetti's tech real-world credibility (as opposed to theoretical applications that are often associated with quantum computing). But despite all of the interest in Rigetti, the company's recent financial results weren't impressive, considering sales fell 32% in the fourth quarter to just $2.3 million. That's not a good look for a young quantum computing company that's trying to carve out a niche in a speculative, new market. Rigetti's share price has soared 639% over the past year, giving its stock an expensive price-to-sales ratio of 147. Investors are now paying a premium for a company whose sales are falling and that's betting on an unproven market. There's no getting around the fact that all stocks are facing some uncertainty right now. President Trump's tariffs have left the market reeling, and many companies are scrambling to adjust to potential changes. Investors should be more cautious than in the recent past about the potential growth for any company, including Nvidia and Rigetti. But if you're looking for the better AI stock right now, Nvidia is it. Even if an economic slowdown arises from tariffs, Nvidia has a strong lead in the AI processor market, and tech giants are still clamoring for its chips. AI spending could slow a bit during a downturn, but the spigots won't likely turn off. Tech giants have too much at stake in their race for AI dominance to slow spending too much. As for Rigetti, I think the stock is simply too speculative. Sure, quantum computing holds a lot of promise, but it could still be years before most companies have real-world uses for the tech. Meanwhile, Rigetti's revenue is tumbling when it should be rising quickly, and its stock is expensive. All of which means it's probably best to leave Rigetti's shares alone right now.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/better-artificial-intelligence-rigetti-nvidia/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-26 13:45:00,"Contrarian Opinion: Tariffs, Inflation, and Recession Fears Could Be a Tailwind for This Retail Stock and Propel It to a $1 Trillion Valuation","Right now, there are only seven public companies that are trading at a market capitalization north of $1 trillion. The exclusive list of trillion-dollar stocks includesApple,Microsoft,Nvidia,Amazon,Alphabet,Meta Platforms, andBerkshire Hathaway. Beyond trillion-dollar stocks, the next three largest companies in the world as measured by market cap areBroadcom,Tesla, andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Do you see any themes here? With the exception of Berkshire, each trillion-dollar or near-trillion-dollar business dominates the technology sector. The next largest company after those referenced above is retail specialistWalmart(WMT-0.89%). With a market value of approximately $760 billion, Walmart is the most valuable non-pure-play technology business on the planet besides Berkshire. Image source: Getty Images. What's interesting is that each company valued higher than Walmart could be facing some unwelcome deceleration across their various businesses thanks in large part to newtariff policies. A common fear in the stock market right now is that tariffs could lead to higher prices (inflation) for consumer goods and raw materials, thereby sparking an economic slowdown (recession). As a contrarian, I think a tariff-induced slowdown could actually benefit Walmart. Let's explore why Walmart's business is ideally positioned to maneuver around any crises caused by tariffs. From there, I'll make the case for why Walmart could soon earn its entry into thetrillion-dollar club. Walmart is primarily known as abrick-and-mortarpowerhouse -- offering consumers a variety of goods across apparel, consumer electronics, produce, home remedies, and much more. While that might not sound too different from stores likeTargetorCVS, Walmart's main value proposition is its attractive prices. Cost-conscious shoppers tend to gravitate toward stores such as Walmart during periods underscored by rising prices or economic uncertainty. To back this idea up, let's take a look at some key performance indicators for the retail juggernaut over the last few years.  US Inflation Ratedata byYCharts The chart above illustrates trends seen in Walmart's revenue and gross profit, indexed against inflation rates over the last five years. In addition, I've included the brief (but important) COVID-19 recession -- as illustrated by the grey column on the left. Let's unpack what's happening here. Following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020, inflation levels started accelerating -- peaking at around 9% in mid-2022. During this period, Walmart's revenue and gross profit started to steadily climb. This is an impressive feat, considering many retailers were plagued by lower foot traffic during the pandemic. Not only are Walmart's prices one way to attract to consumers, but the company has also done a stellar job complementing its physical retail storefronts with ane-commercemarketplace of its own -- providing it with multiple avenues to monetize shoppers. Taking this a step further, let's analyze some important metrics retailers use to gauge the health of their business. During the fourth quarter of Walmart's fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 31), the company recognizedsame-store salesgrowth of 4.6%, while transactions rose by 2.8% and average ticket size grew by 1.8%. This means that Walmart is seeing more people come to its stores and spending more money while they are there. Although same-store sales, transaction volumes, andaverage order sizecan be variable in the retail space, I think any concerns related to this are mitigated by Walmart's ability to hold onto its shoppers. The big takeaway I gather from the chart above is that Walmart's revenue and gross profit continue to steadily rise, even as inflation levels have cooled over the last two years. I think ongoing economic uncertainty from tariffs could wind up being a tailwind for Walmart and its ability to lure consumers in and keep them part of its ecosystem in the long run. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, Walmart's earnings per share (EPS) totaled $2.42. Given the company's current share price of $95, Walmart stock trades for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 39. A $1 trillion market capitalization implies roughly a 32% increase Walmart's current valuation of $760 billion. This means in order to reach the trillion-dollar club, Walmart stock would need to be trading around $125 per share. If I assume that the company expands both its EPS and P/E ratio by 15%, that would imply future earnings of $2.81 and a P/E ratio of 45 for Walmart. In turn, this results in a future share price of about $126, which would put Walmart just above a trillion-dollar market capitalization. I think this level of EPS growth is attainable for Walmart, especially against the backdrop of a cloudy economic picture. The bigger question mark is whether investors will start applying a premium multiple to Walmart -- viewing it as a more essential player in the retail arena, all while giving the company credit for some of its higher-margin pursuits beyond brick-and-mortar sales. While the exercise above is rooted in simple math, I am cautiously optimistic that Walmart could emerge as a member of the trillion-dollar club sooner rather than later. Investors looking for opportunities that may be slightly more insulated from tariffs or economic slowdowns may want to consider a position in Walmart right now.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/contrarian-opinion-tariffs-inflation-and-recession/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-26 14:22:45,NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Maintains AI Leadership Amid Export Headwinds and GB200 Launch,"We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket. AI (Artificial Intelligence) isn‚Äôt just a buzzword anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming a part of our everyday lives, from the apps we use to how businesses operate. For investors, that means opportunity. As AI continues to grow, some companies are leading the charge and showing real potential for long-term gains. Whether you‚Äôre looking to diversify your portfolio or tap into the future of tech, this article will walk you through some of the best AI stocks worth watching right now. AI stocks saw incredible gains over the last couple of years, particularly in 2024, as AI applications burgeoned. The current weakness in AI stocks, caused by geopolitical tensions, may be a good opportunity to load up on AI stocks. In an interview with CNBC, the CEO and CIO of Ark Invest, Cathie Wood, underscored her bullishness on the AI sector despite the recent weakness in those stocks. According to Wood, AI has a massive runway. She compared the current AI position to the internet in the early to mid-90s. Wood is optimistic about robotaxis in the near term and the application of humanoid robots in the long term. However, the most under-appreciated application of AI, according to Wood, is healthcare, as AI will accelerate the curing of diseases. Within the medical application of AI, Cathie Wood is particularly bullish on sequencing technology, which is used to read DNA. AI is a great application in sequencing as it helps analyze, interpret, and act on that genetic data much quicker and more accurately than traditional methods. A segment within AI that is hot right now is Generative AI. Generative AI creates customized answers for the user based on real underlying data. Gen AI has created a massive investment cycle of over $200 billion annually, led by the ‚Äòmagnificent 7‚Äô. The tech behemoths are competing intensely over leadership in Gen AI. Meanwhile, an upcoming AI theme centers on how large language models (LLMs). According to Morgan Stanley, leading companies behind the most advanced LLMs are prioritizing high-performance chips and top-tier software to deliver AI solutions that are becoming essential for both businesses and consumers. While initial LLM use cases primarily included content creation, summarization, and categorization, industry leaders believe that the greatest yet-to-be-realized opportunity lies in applying AI reasoning to enterprise data. To compile the list of AI stocks that will skyrocket, we reviewed AI ETFs to compile a preliminary list of stocks and then selected the ones with the highest upside potential based on Wall Street analysts‚Äô average price targets. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Note: All data was recorded on April 21, 2025.

2025-04-26 14:29:45,Analyst on NVIDIA (NVDA): ‚ÄòEveryone Is Confirming Demand is Crazy‚Äô,"We recently published a list ofTop 10 Stocks to Watch Ahead of May. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks to watch ahead of May. Aswath Damodaran from NYU Stern School of Business said in a latest interview with CNBC that while investors are ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù positive results of a few major tech companies, the problems haunting these firms will take a while to show up in their results. However, Damodaran, also known as ‚ÄòDean of Valuation,‚Äô said it won‚Äôt be prudent to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù entirely on Mag. 7 companies. ‚ÄúThey can consolidate their advantage. In a weird way, again, all these troubles might play into the hands of the Mag 7, because the more troubles there are, the more flexibility gets rewarded. And as you pointed out, these companies are incredibly flexible, incredibly adaptable. We saw that with COVID, we saw that in 2022 with inflation, and I‚Äôm convinced you‚Äôre going to see it again. Doesn‚Äôt mean you load up on the Mag 7, but if you‚Äôve never owned them, you had a chance to buy into at least one or two of them in the last month. You might have missed that chance, but the chance was there. So I wouldn‚Äôt give up that easily on the Mag 7.‚Äù Damodaran said investors experienced a lot of ‚Äútrauma‚Äù in April. He argued against reactionary investing and said that when investors respond to daily events and news cycles, they damage their portfolios. ‚ÄúMaybe the best thing investors could have done is left at the start of the month, gone somewhere without internet service, and come back at the end of the month.

I think there‚Äôs still everyone, Tom, there‚Äôs no cracks in the demand story for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and chips in general. Everyone is confirming that demand is crazy. OpenAI just‚Äîor yeah, OpenAI ChatGPT‚Äîthey just confirmed their demand is still strong. So I just think there‚Äôs so many things, and Tom, here‚Äôs my question that I used to say about Tesla a lot, now I say about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA): what‚Äôs in their pipeline? We know the Rubin chips are in their pipeline, and I‚Äôll give investors, our viewers, one thought‚Äîwhat if they have a Palantir story, Tom? What if they take something that‚Äôs general to hyperscalers and make it for the general public? What if they start doing that? Think of what that could do to their demand, right? And so what‚Äôs the next generation of what NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is doing? Jensen Huang, really smart guy, is good at what he does. And so I think this is a sell-off with the rest of the market, a little bit heightened because of the popularity of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).‚Äù Nvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC‚Äôs 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia‚Äôs access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses¬† TSMC‚Äôs 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offer alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia‚Äôs offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: ‚ÄúNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia‚Äôs computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance due to several factors. In January 2025, investor concerns grew regarding the emergence of advanced AI models from China, reportedly developed at lower costs and with reduced computing requirements, raising doubts about Nvidia‚Äôs market dominance. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement of new tariffs targeting industries increased worries about higher operational costs. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia reported robust fiscal fourth-quarter results, highlighted by significant revenue growth driven by its data center segment. On the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the increasing computational requirements of future AI models, noting, ‚ÄúThe more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer,‚Äù and adding that future reasoning models could demand substantially more compute resources. We believe Nvidia‚Äôs leadership in scaling AI infrastructure‚Äîincluding advancements in inference and reasoning during inference‚Äîcontinues to drive adoption among enterprises and startups, ensuring sustained demand for its high performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed and new clusters deployed, we see Nvidia as well-positioned to capitalize on rising computational needs across AI applications.‚Äù Overall, NVDAranks 3rdon our list of top stocks to watch ahead of May. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

2025-04-26 18:25:00,1 No-Brainer AI Stock Down 27% to Buy the Dip on Right Now (Hint: It's Not Nvidia),"There's no question that 2025 has been a rough year for AI stocks thus far. Pressure from the trade war, high valuations in the sector, and signs that demand may be slowing have all weighed on these fast-growing stocks as nearly all are down year-to-date. As of April 25, theNasdaq Compositewas down 11% for the year, and in a bear market, according to some definitions. However, seasoned investors know that these sell-offs present buying opportunities, and one of the most attractive right now isTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.57%), which is trading down 27% from its peak earlier this year. Image source: Getty Images. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, often known as TSMC, is the world's biggest contract semiconductor, handling more than 50% of contract chip production in the world, and an estimated 90% of contract production for advanced chips. TSMC is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, and it's the company that tech titans likeApple,Nvidia,Broadcom,Advanced Micro Devices, andQualcomm, among others, making it a linchpin in the global technology supply chain. Because of its advanced chip-making capabilities, it's also a major player in artificial intelligence (AI). TSMC has delivered impressive growth through the AI era, and the company benefits from significant competitive advantages in capacity, expertise, technology, and customer relationships. In its recently released first-quarter earnings report, revenue jumped 41.6% to $25.5 billion even as the company dealt with the fallout from an earthquake in January, and operating income clocked in at $12.4 billion, giving it an operating margin of 48.5%. Management noted a sequential slowdown in smartphone demand due to seasonality, but said that AI-related demand continued to grow, driven by sales of 3nm and 5nm chips. It also said that tariff policies have not had an impact on customer behavior so far. Advanced chips, defined as 7nm or less, made up 73% of the company's revenue in the first quarter, showing its strength in advanced technologies. Additionally, 59% of its revenue came from high-performance computing, representing the kind of AI applications that partners like Nvidia turn to TSMC for. Based on the explosion in AI demand and TSMC's impressive revenue growth, it's clear that there's plenty of growth potential for the company, especially as demand for semiconductors should expand over the long term as semiconductors work their way into more products and the tech frontier pushes forward. Because of the need for semiconductors and concerns about geopolitical tensions around Taiwan, where the company is based, TSMC is building several new plants around the world, including in the U.S., where it's seen as an attractive manufacturing partner. TSMC was a big winner under the CHIPS Act passed under the Biden administration, and the Trump administration and TSMC recently announced that the company would invest $100 billion in the U.S. in chip manufacturing. If TSMC can geographically diversify its manufacturing base and adequately grow its capacity, the company's competitive advantages should become even stronger over the coming years. TSMC is a dominant tech company with a long runway of growth ahead of it and sustainable competitive advantages. However, the stock also trades at a surprisingly low valuation for a company of its stature at aprice-to-earnings ratioof just 21, meaning it trades at a discount to theS&P 500. That seems to reflect investor nervousness around geopolitical tensions in Taiwan, but it's in the interest of both the U.S. and China to avoid a military conflict around the island, and even during the trade war, there's been no hint of potential military aggression. Additionally, the semiconductor sector is cyclical, and it would be sensitive to a lasting trade war or a global recession. However, those risks seem to be more than priced in at the current valuation. Over the long term, given its growth potential, competitive advantages, and low valuation, TSMC looks like an easy winner.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/26/1-no-brainer-ai-stock-down-to-buy-the-dip-on-right/?.tsrc=rss,3

2025-04-27 07:45:00,"2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy With $2,000","The stock market has gotten off to a rocky start this year, but market volatility is a small price to pay for the large gains of holding shares of a great business over many years. If you put your money in the right growth stocks, you can build wealth that lasts for generations. Consider thatCoca-Colahas been around since 1886, yet its stock is still hitting new highs in 2025. If you have $2,000 extra cash you don't need for other life priorities, putting that cash to work in shares of leadingartificial intelligence (AI)companies could be very rewarding over the next decade and beyond. The following AI stocks would make solid additions to a well-rounded portfolio of growth investments. Companies are in the process of investing substantial sums in AI.ServiceNow(NOW0.74%)is a leader provider of AI software that helps businesses streamline workflows and increase operating efficiency. It is used by leading companies, including the U.S. government, and it continues to see strong demand. The company just announced another quarter of strong growth that has the stock moving higher. ServiceNow's subscription revenue grew 19% year-over-year in Q1, exceeding expectations. Wall Street was fearful that uncertainty in the economy would weigh on near-term investment in software, but ServiceNow's momentum isn't slowing. It closed 72 deals over $1 million in net new annual contract value. It is positioning to be a leader in agentic AI. AI agents are super-intelligent assistants that can take a request by the user and complete a series of tasks to solve a problem. Demand for advanced AI features drove a 150% year-over-year increase in the number of deals for ServiceNow's Pro Plus AI offerings last quarter. ServiceNow also seems well positioned to benefit from potential new deals in its federal government business, where it has more than 1,700 federal and public sector customers. The Trump administration's goal to increase government efficiency certainly plays to ServiceNow's capabilities.Its U.S. public sector revenue grew over 30% year-over-year in Q1, including one new customer in the federal government. What's clear is that ServiceNow is emerging as a go-to solution for leading organizations wanting to use AI to improve productivity and modernize operations. The need to reduce costs and improve efficiency is becoming more urgent than ever. As each company adopts AI solutions, it leads to a domino effect where other companies are basically forced to adopt similar solutions to stay competitive. This is fueling ServiceNow's momentum. The stock popped 23% following its Q1 earnings results, but it's still trading more than 30% from its recent highs. Investors could split their $2,000 and buy one share of ServiceNow. Analysts are projecting the company'searningsto grow at an annualized rate of 30%, which could fuel handsome gains for investors over the next several years. The demand for AI software also fuels growth for leading suppliers of advanced computing chips. Training applications to solve problems without human input requires substantial investment in graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI training, andNvidia's(NVDA4.11%)GPUs are the gold standard. Nvidia has been the leader in GPUs for many years. As the leading supplier of very pricey chips, it is a highly profitable business, with $73 billion in trailing-12-month net income. It has growing resources to invest in innovation to remain the leader for years to come. Nvidia's chips were the popular choice the past few years that helped train the AI for OpenAI's ChatGPT and other popular AI models. Cloud giants likeAmazonWeb Services and Google Cloud are some of Nvidia's top customers. Nvidia's new Blackwell chips are in high demand, with analysts expecting the company's revenue to increase 55% to $201 billion this year. Annual spending ondata centerinfrastructure, which is Nvidia's largest addressable market, is expected to reach $1 trillion in the coming years, according to Dell'Oro Group. But CEO Jensen Huang believes that the market for GPU-based computing systems could be hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars. That's based on the idea that every company and industry will one day run on AI. Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to grow more than 35% per year over the next several years. Yet investors can currently buy the shares for 22 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. That's modest for a company growing at these rates. Investors who split their money between ServiceNow andNvidiawill own shares of two dominant AI companies on the software and hardware side and will be in a great position to profit from the growth of AI.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/2-artificial-intelligence-stocks-to-buy-with-2000/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-27 08:29:00,Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar After May 1,"Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)has been taking a beating so far this year. Shares have plunged nearly 30% year to date as of this writing. Yet the stock is stillhigherby more than 27% over the past 12 months. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader remains one of thelargest companies by market cap, valued at about $2.4 trillion. The question for investors is whether Nvidia stock can regain its momentum and return the company to a valuation of $3 trillion or beyond. I believe it can, and I think one key date to watch is coming up on May 1. The decline in Nvidia shares in recent months has had several forces behind it. Most obvious was the stock's more than 800% return over the two-year period ending Dec. 31, 2024. It's natural for some investors to want to protect those gains. Trying to time stock prices can be hazardous to one's financial health, though. Long-term investments are better left untouched if the company's underlying business prospects remain strong. That brings us to another headwind for Nvidia stock. Uncertainty related to tariffs and general demand for AI infrastructure. The company was recently forced to take a $5.5 billion charge as the U.S. government placed indefinite restrictions on its H20 chip sales to China. Those chips were specifically designed for the Chinese market, and that business will inevitably be filled by other, potentially domestic, Chinesechip suppliers. Image source: Getty Images. While China sales are important for Nvidia, they only represented about 13% of total revenue in fiscal year 2025. More critical is the trajectory of demand for its AI products frommajor tech companieslikeMicrosoft,Amazon, and others. That is also now coming into question. Recent reports have reiterated aWells Fargoanalyst note saying that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has delayed prior plans fornew data center leases. Microsoft, another large cloud infrastructure provider, has made similar decisions to slow data center expansion, according to the analysts. That comes after plans to aggressively expand cloud infrastructure capacity with hundreds of billions of dollars in capital spending for Nvidia'sGPU hardwarehad been announced by several companies. Others, including xAI andMeta, appear to be continuing with growth plans. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had previously toldCNBCthat he didn't expect to cut back on capital spending for data center compute capacity. That's why investors need to mark May 1 on their calendars. Amazon is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on that date. Microsoft will be providing its quarterly update the day prior. Amazon AWS vice president of global data centers Kevin Miller called any modification in plans ""routine capacity management."" If the companies reiterate that capital spending plans are basically on track, investors could pour back into Nvidia stock after its recent plunge. Nvidia'sprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratiois now near a three-year low based on current fiscal year earnings estimates.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts The long-term growth of AI doesn't look to be hitting a wall. Enterprises, as well as consumers, should increase use. And Nvidia isn't just making money on AI hardware. It has robust software architecture offerings that companies are buying. It also has a fast-growing robotics and assisted driving segment. Business spending could fluctuate. An economic slowdown or even recession could delay the pace of AI expansion. In the end, though, Nvidia remains the sector leader. I suspect long-term investors will look back on its recent stock price as a fine investment opportunity.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/prediction-nvidia-stock-will-soar-after-may-1/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-27 08:49:00,Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 3 Years?,"Since the beginning of 2023,Nvidia(NVDA4.11%)has added more than $2.2 trillion to its market capitalization on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Demand is through the roof for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the gold standard for developing AI models. Nvidia's customers include some of the world's biggest technology companies, which are battling for AI supremacy, includingMicrosoft,Amazon,Meta Platforms, andAlphabet.These four companies are forecast to spend a record amount of money on data center infrastructure during 2025. But according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, that spending will increase significantly every year for the foreseeable future, and cross an important milestone in 2028. The company continues to launch new chips to maintain its edge over the competition, so here's where its stock could be in three years. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia's H100 data centerGPUdominated the industry in 2023 and for most of 2024. It was based on the company's Hopper architecture, which has since been superseded by Blackwell and, more recently, Blackwell Ultra. The upcoming Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU can deliver up to 50 times more performance than the H100 in certain configurations, because it was designed for next-generationAI models, which are capable of ""reasoning."" In the past, chatbots likeOpenAI'sChatGPT would quickly render one-shot responses to users' queries, which made them convenient, but they occasionally blurted out inaccurate information. Reasoning models spend more time thinking and correcting potential errors in the background in order to deliver more polished responses. While this is a great step forward for the AI industry, it does create some new challenges. Huang says reasoning models require a staggering 100 times more computing power than their predecessors for two reasons. First, they consume 10 times more tokens than traditionallarge language models(LLMs) because of all the thinking that goes on in the background. Second, they are much slower to render responses, which means GPUs need to be up to 10 times more powerful to offset the delays, or else AI will lose the convenience factor that people have grown to love. That's why new chips based on the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra architectures are in such high demand. The four Nvidia customers I mentioned at the top -- Microsoft,Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet -- have told investors they plan to spend over $300 billion (combined) on data center infrastructure and chips this year, which would be a record. That doesn't include other big spenders like OpenAI,Tesla, orOracle. But Huang thinks this is just the beginning, because three years from now in 2028, he predicts data center spending will top $1 trillion annually, which would be a monumental tailwind for Nvidia's business. Nvidia generated a record $130.5 billion in totalrevenueduring its fiscal year 2025 (which ended Jan. 26). The data center segment accounted for $115.2 billion of that figure, which represented a whopping 142% increase from the prior year, highlighting how quickly GPU demand is growing. Nvidia's soaring top line also drove a significant increase in profits, with the company'searnings per share(EPS) soaring by 130% to $2.99 in fiscal 2025. That places its stock at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof just 36, which is a 39% discount to its 10-year average of 59.6. But the stock looks even cheaper on a forward basis. Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Nvidia will deliver $4.42 in EPS during the current fiscal year 2026, placing its stock at aforward P/E ratioof 23.9: NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts. In other words, Nvidia stock would have to soar by around 149% over the next 12 months just to trade in line with its 10-year average P/E ratio of 59.6, implying a price of $263 per share. But even if its P/E ratio remains at 36 instead, the stock could still top $200 in fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027) based on Wall Street's earnings forecast for that year. Therefore, as long as Nvidia maintainssomeannual earnings growth after that, its stock should be trading well beyond $200 in calendar year 2028. Considering that's the year Huang is forecasting $1 trillion in data center spending, the company should have no problem generating more earnings. The reason Nvidia's P/E ratio looks so attractive right now is because its stock is down 29% from its all-time high amid thesimmering global trade tensions, which threaten to dampen economic growth in the near term. Some of Nvidia's top customers might be forced to temporarily pull back on their data center investments if they suffer a slowdown in their core businesses, which would reduce demand for GPUs and dent the company's earnings potential. However, AI is shaping up to be a long-term boom, and the industry can't move forward without the hardware supplied by companies like Nvidia. Therefore, investors who buy Nvidia stock todaymight have to weather some volatilitywhile the U.S. negotiates new trade deals with other countries, but they could do extremely well if they put the short-term noise aside and stay focused on the years ahead.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/where-will-nvidia-stock-be-in-3-years/?.tsrc=rss,4
2025-04-27 09:51:00,"Prediction: This Stock Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple 5 Years From Now","Two companies have sat at or near the top of the list of the world's most valuable companies for the better part of a decade:Apple(AAPL0.41%)andMicrosoft(MSFT1.21%). The longtime tech giants were recently joined at the top of the list byNvidia(NVDA4.11%), which has skyrocketed in value as demand for its market-leading GPUs soared. All three of these companies have, at one time or another, surpassed a market valuation of $3 trillion, although Apple is the only one hanging onto that milestone at the moment. Meanwhile, there's a clear gap between the three giants in the market and the next group of mega-cap stocks. But there's one company that could join and even surpass Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple's valuation over the next five years, and its stock looks like an incredible value right now. Image source: Getty Images. The appeal of a company like Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia, which have come to completely dominate certain markets like smartphones, PC operating systems and enterprise productivity software, andGPUsis clear. But a company that dominates multiple industries can be even more appealing. Especially if those industries have strong growth potential. That's whyAmazon(AMZN1.35%)looks like such a great opportunity for investors right now. Amazon holds a dominant position ine-commerce. It's the market leader incloud computing. It's one of the largest digital advertising channels, and it's growing quickly. And it has several additional growth opportunities ahead. Amazon got to this point by being willing to sacrifice in the short-term for long-term potential gain. And that gain started to come to fruition in the last few years. That's evidenced by its massive free cash flow growth and expanding operating margin. Amazon set new records for both in 2024, generating $32.9 billion in free cash flow with a 10.75% operating margin. Importantly, Amazon has seen improvements in profitability across all of its businesses. North American retail saw its operating margin expand to 6.4% last year from 4.2% last year. Its international segment turned positive last year as well, generating operating margin of 2.7% versus -2% in 2023. And Amazon Web Services generated a massive operating margin of 37% in 2024 versus 27% in 2023. That margin expansion should continue in 2025. Amazon spent the last two years revamping its logistics network in the United States to reduce costs and improve delivery times. It's gone from a heavy investment cycle and it's now capitalizing on that investment with improved profitability. Amazon's high-margin advertising business is also wrapped up in its retail business. That's poised to grow quickly as it expands advertising inventory with more video ads in Prime Video and its marketplace. Meanwhile, Amazon has committed to spending heavily on Amazon Web Services in 2025 to meet the growing demand for AI services. But its spending ahead of forecasted demand. Management said it remained capacity constrained in 2024, so it expects significant revenue growth in 2025 as it builds out more data centers for AWS. Despite the massive spending on AWS, the improved profitability should produce continued growth in free cash flow over time. Amazon has never been afraid to expand into new opportunities when it sees them. And there are two big opportunities where the company can leverage its massive infrastructure to provide services few others can compete with. The first big opportunity is in the continued growth of artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon can benefit not just from a raw compute perspective, but from additional services that can help enterprises make the most oflarge language models. It introduced Amazon Bedrock to help customers leverage the foundation models of others, customized with a customers' own data, to build new AI applications. Its also building its own AI applications for consumers, and providing frameworks for businesses to easily develop their own applications or internal AI agents. This likely is still the early innings of AI development, and Amazon is positioned to be one of the big winners from continued growth. The other opportunity is in logistics. Amazon has built an extensive network of fulfillment centers and warehouses throughout the country. Amazon shipped more packages than any other carrier in the United States in 2022. As mentioned it recently revamped its system to maximize the efficiency of the massive network. Amazon offers limited services for merchants outside of its marketplace, but it could launch its own logistics service for third parties in the future, andits a big opportunity. Considering Amazon could mostly leverage existing infrastructure and systems, the incremental profits from logistics services could be another major growth lever for the business. With multiple leading positions in several fast-growing markets and new opportunities ahead, it may be only a matter of time before Amazon overtakes Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock currently looks relatively undervalued. Its forward PE sits around 29.5 as of this writing. While that's higher than the three biggest companies in the market, it's relatively low for Amazon. That's especially true if youcompare Amazon to other retailers right nowor its historic PE ratio. Moreover, Amazon is charting a path to grow its free cash flow significantly over the next few years as AWS scales and its retail operations become more profitable. By 2030, the company could easily surpass $100 billion in annual free cash flow. (It's worth noting, analysts previously thought Amazon would reach that level by next year, but Amazon's plans to spend $100 billion on capex this year and greater economic uncertainty have reduced those estimates.) With a 2% free cash flow yield, that would put its valuation at $5 trillion, a 2.5% yield would put it at $4 trillion. Even if Amazon doesn't overtake Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple by then, that still presents an appealing opportunity with a current market valuation less than $2 trillion.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/prediction-this-stock-will-be-worth-more-than-nvid/?.tsrc=rss,4

2025-04-27 10:21:00,2 Bargain Stocks You Can't Afford to Miss Out on During the Stock Market Sell-Off,"Even though the market has slightly recovered from the lows it experienced not long ago, it's still well off its all-time highs. Despite this, there are plenty of bargains to be found in the market. Two that I'm most excited about areTaiwan Semiconductor(TSM0.57%)andThe Trade Desk(TTD1.33%). Although they operate in completely different industries, they will be OK over the long term. Taiwan Semi is the leading contract chip manufacturer and has contracts with many of the largest tech companies around the globe. Companies likeApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)andNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)don't have chip production capabilities; they just handle end assembly of their chips. Instead, they source their chips from Taiwan Semi, which acts as a fabrication facility. While there may be some concerns with TSMC's geographical location outside the U.S. andpotential exposure to tariffs, there are no tariffs on semiconductors right now. However, the Trump administration has stated that one will come soon. Taiwan Semiconductor is already taking steps to sidestep these tariffs by building facilities in the U.S. In addition to the $65 billion facility already built in Arizona, Taiwan Semi announced a $100 billion investment to stand up six new facilities in the U.S. However, those facilities will take some time, which leaves TSMC on the hook if semiconductor tariffs are eventually implemented. However, the fear of tariffs didn't stop Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO from stating: We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies. However, we have not seen any change in our customers' behavior so far. Therefore, we continue to expect our full year 2025 revenue to increase by close to mid-20s percent in U.S. dollar terms. That's bullish news for investors, yet the stock has barely budged after that announcement.  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At 17 times forward earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is a steal at these levels, and investors should use this market-wide weakness as their opportunity to scoop up the top player in the chip production industry. The market is valuing TSMC's stock like it will lose substantial business, yet management is stating the exact opposite. The Trade Desk has been hit by two sell-offs in 2025: one from the broader market and the other from a bad earnings report. In the fourth quarter, The Trade Desk missed revenue expectations for the first time in company history, which caused the stock to sell off by more than 30% the next day. This occurred in mid-February, which was right before the broader market sell-off began. These two events compounded each other, which is why The Trade Desk's stock is down around 65% from its all-time high. However, this is a very shortsighted reaction. The Trade Desk is one of the most dominant companies in the digital advertising space. It helps ad buyers (those with a product or service to sell) find the most opportune spaces to place their ads on the Internet. This can range from the margins of a website to connected TV to podcast ads. Targeted ads are the most effective form of advertising, and using AI to power that feature is key to success. The Trade Desk has been urging clients to migrate from its old offering to the new AI-powered platform, and the company largely wrapped up that process in Q4. This is what caused the revenue miss, as The Trade Desk prioritized long-term customer relationships rather than short-term revenue. This will pay off over the next few years, but the market really only cares about the next few months. The digital media space still has a massive growth runway, and The Trade Desk is primed to benefit from this migration. But after the sell-off, all the optimism in The Trade Desk's stock seems gone.  TTD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Thought 28 times forward earnings may not seem like a bargain compared to other stocks in the market (like Taiwan Semiconductor), the company's dominance in this growing industry can't be ignored. As a result, I think investors should be taking advantage of themarket's sale price on The Trade Desk's stock.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/2-bargain-stocks-you-cant-afford-to-miss-out-on-du/?.tsrc=rss,3
2025-04-27 10:45:00,3 Growth Stocks Down 30% or More to Buy Right Now,"Pinpointing strong bargains in the stock market is key to success, and the market is full of them right now. While some may be concerned about tariff effects in the short term, most of these stocks have incredibly bright long-term outlooks. By shifting your focus from the next few months to the next few years, you can ignore some of today's events, and it will be obvious which stocks are great buys now. Three companies that are down more than 30% from their all-time highs and look like excellent buys areNvidia(NVDA4.11%),Taiwan Semiconductor(TSM0.57%), andASML(ASML0.38%). These three also represent a great picture of the AI chip value chain, and as long as AI continues to be an area where businesses invest, these three will succeed. As a quick overview of the supply chain, Nvidia places Taiwan Semiconductor's chips in itsGPUs (graphics processing units), which have been the primary computing unit deployed by the AI hyperscalers. To make these chips, Taiwan Semiconductor needs specialized machines from ASML known as extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography machines. No company in the world has EUV technology besides ASML, so its engineering dominance has earned it a technological monopoly. As the demand for Nvidia GPUs rises, so does the need for more Taiwan Semi chips. Increased chip demand requires more production capacity, which means more ASML EUV machines. Again, this requires AI demand to continue rising, which seems to be the way that it's heading. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated at its 2025 GTC event that data center buildouts will increase from about $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. Considering that Nvidia's trailing 12-month total data center revenue was $115 billion, it gets nearly a third of all data center spending. That's a huge chunk of the market, and if Nvidia can maintain that percentage, it will deliver monster growth over the next few years. This also jives with what Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO, C.C. Wei, has been saying. For 2025, they expect revenue from their AI-related chips to double. Additionally, over the next five years, they expect AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compounded annual growth rate, which would be an incredible achievement. While investors can speculate whether these projections are valid, the reality is that these two CEOs are better connected to the demand than almost anybody else. While they can still make mistakes, the odds of getting this information completely wrong are unlikely. As a result, investors need to take refuge in the fact that there is still a massive AI buildout going on, and this trend will be unlikely to be disrupted over the next five years unless a severe economic collapse occurs. I don't think that's likely, which makes these three stocks intriguing considering their sale prices. While these stocks used to be highly valued, they aren't that way anymore following the sell-off.  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts ASML is the most expensive stock on the list at 24.4 times forward earnings, but those projections don't include ASML's recently announced plan to repurchase up to 10% of its stock. This could be a huge boost for the stock, making it even cheaper than it currently appears. Nvidia at 23 times forward earnings is a no-brainer, as the growth it's expected to achieve over the next few years is quite impressive. Lastly, Taiwan Semiconductor is a steal at these levels because the broader market (as measured by theS&P 500(^GSPC0.74%)) trades for 19.8 times forward earnings. TSMC is expecting market-beating growth over the next five years, so buying it at a discount to the market is a great investment opportunity. These three may be hurting, but the long-term outlook is still clear. All three of these stocks look like excellent bargains, andinvestors should scoop them up while they're still cheap.",News,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/27/3-growth-stocks-down-30-or-more-to-buy-right-now/?.tsrc=rss,3

Latest reports from the IMF reveal that economic gains from artificial intelligence are likely to outweigh the costs of rising carbon emissions from the data centers needed to run AI models. The report, released at the IMF‚Äôs annual spring meeting in Washington, revealed how artificial intelligence is going to boost global output by around 0.5% a year between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, it also noted how these output gains will not be shared equally worldwide. READ NOW:Top 10 AI Stocks Making Headlines TodayandTop 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week ""Despite challenges related to higher electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions, the gains to global GDP from AI are likely to outweigh the cost of the additional emissions. The social cost of these extra emissions is minor compared with the expected economic gains from AI, yet it still adds to the worrisome buildup of emissions‚Äù. Considering that energy policies remain the same and artificial intelligence use becomes widespread, greenhouse gas emissions will see a cumulative global increase of 1.2% between 2025 and 2030. However, a switch to greener energy policies would limit the increase to 1.3 Gt. Quantifying the social cost of these emissions, the report calculated that the extra cost is likely to be at $50.7-$66.3 billion, which is smaller than the income gains that can help boost the economy by 0.5% each year through AI. According to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, AI may even be able to generate an overall reduction in carbon emissions if it accelerates advances in low-carbon technologies in the power, food, and transport sectors.

2025-04-27 13:00:00,Big Tech‚Äôs Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High,"(Bloomberg) -- The last time Big Tech delivered earnings, Donald Trump had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors‚Äô main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits. Most Read from Bloomberg Why Car YouTuber Matt Farah Is Fighting for Walkable Cities Newsom Says California Is Now the World‚Äôs Fourth-Biggest Economy At Bryn Mawr, a Monumental Plaza Traces the Steps of Black History Backyard Micro-Flats Aim to Ease South Africa‚Äôs Housing Crisis Los Angeles Downgraded to AA- by S&P Due to Budget Woes Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture. This week‚Äôs quarterly results from Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that‚Äôs wiped $5.5 trillion from the S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap. Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn‚Äôt giving the companies‚Äô estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven ‚Äî which also includes Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. ‚Äî to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that‚Äôs barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions. That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks‚Äô share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster fears of muted corporate spending ahead. ‚ÄúAny modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,‚Äù said Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year‚Äôs weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity. Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its worst quarter in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive Elon Musk intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet beat expectations but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 index jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it‚Äôs still down 15% in 2025. Profits and Spending A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams. Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders ‚Äî Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta ‚Äî are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft‚Äôs sudden decision to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures. Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. That said, there‚Äôs little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty. American Airlines Group Inc. and Skechers USA Inc. are among companies that have abandoned forecasts this quarter. Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters. ‚ÄúI think the more experienced management aren‚Äôt even going to try,‚Äù he said. A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants‚Äô dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies ‚Äî even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trump said a deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs he‚Äôs posted on Chinese goods. But for Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, it all comes down to the denominator in the price-to-earnings ratio. ‚ÄúThe valuations are getting more interesting down here, but we haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger yet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of questions on the E-side of the equation.‚Äù Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek As More Women Lift Weights, Gyms Might Never Be the Same Why US Men Think College Isn‚Äôt Worth It Anymore Eight Charts Show Men Are Falling Behind, From Classrooms to Careers The Mastermind of the Yellowstone Universe Isn‚Äôt Done Yet Healthy Sodas Like Poppi, Olipop Are Drawing PepsiCo‚Äôs and Coca-Cola‚Äôs Attention ¬©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",News,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-problem-estimates-130000512.html?.tsrc=rss,4
