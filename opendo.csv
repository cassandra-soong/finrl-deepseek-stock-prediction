2025-03-11T04:33:00Z;Nasdaq correction: Time to buy the dip on Nvidia?;"The Nasdaq Composite has moved into correction territory (down at least 10% from all-time highs). A significant contributor to that drop has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock, which is down about 20% year to date, as of this writing. The chipmaker reported outstanding results recently, but investor concerns about tariffs and the U.S. suddenly looking like it could be headed toward a recession have rattled the market in the near term.
For investors interested in Nvidia who have a long-term mindset, this price correction presents a great opportunity to scoop up Nvidia shares on the cheap. Let's look at three reasons why the stock is a must-buy for the long term on this dip.
1. Nvidia is the artificial intelligence infrastructure leader
With an approximate 90% market share for graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia is the dominant leader among the chip designers that are powering the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout. While originally designed to speed up graphics rendering in video games, Nvidia's GPUs' fast processing times have made them ideal for helping train large language models (LLMs) and running inference for AI.
In addition, the company's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) platform has helped create a wide moat for the company. Nvidia became the first company to allow GPUs to be programmed for tasks outside their original purpose back in 2006 through CUDA. As such, developers learned to program GPUs using Nvidia's software platform.
Rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) didn't introduce its ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) software platform until about 10 years later in 2016. Meanwhile, through CUDA-X, which was built on top of CUDA, Nvidia now has a full software stack comprised of libraries, microservices, and tools designed to accelerate applications in the areas of AI and high-performance computing.
CUDA and CUDA-X continue to be the primary reason for Nvidia's dominance, particularly in AI model training. In a recent study, semiconductor research outfit Semianalysis found AMD's latest GPUs unusable for AI training out of the box due to software bugs, while praising Nvidia's chips. As such, Nvidia remains the company best positioned to continue to benefit from AI infrastructure growth.
2. AI data center infrastructure continues to grow
Despite Chinese AI company DeepSeek's claims of building an effective AI model cheaply (how effective it actually is is in dispute), the best-known way to advance AI models currently is through brute compute-power force. This means building out systems with more and more AI chip clusters.
Recent AI model iterations have needed exponentially more GPU chips to be trained on than their predecessors. For example, Meta Platform's Llama 4 LLM needed 10x as many GPUs to be trained on than Llama 3. Elon Musk-backed xAI, meanwhile, originally used 5x the GPUs (100,000) to build out its Grok 3 model before bumping it up to 200,000 GPUs.
Meanwhile, cloud computing companies, along with other tech companies, are pouring money into building AI data centers. The big three cloud computing companies plan to spend a combined $255 billion building out AI data centers this year to help keep up with demand.
Cloud computing is an infrastructure-as-a-service platform, and customers have been using these services to help customize and build their own AI models and applications. Meanwhile, Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year largely aimed at expanding its AI infrastructure, while a consortium led by OpenAI and Softbank have pledged to spend $500 billion over the next few years building out AI data centers in the U.S. through Project Stargate.
This all points to a lot of continued future spending on AI infrastructure in the years ahead. As such, Nvidia remains well-positioned to continue to grow.
3. Nvidia stock is inexpensive
The third big reason to own Nvidia is that its stock remains attractively priced. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 24 times 2025 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of below 0.5. PEG ratios under 1 typically indicate a stock is undervalued, and growth stocks will often trade at PEGs well above 1. Nvidia isn't a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company with a recurring and predictable revenue stream, so it isn't going to command the same type of valuation multiple as these types of companies -- nor should it. However, its current valuation is inexpensive, given that we still appear to be in the early days of AI and that AI infrastructure spending will continue to rise. As such, the recent pullback looks like a solid buying opportunity in the stock long term."

2025-03-11T11:18:00Z;Nvidia’s Stock Takes a Beating as Trump’s Tariffs Derail AI Market;"Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock is struggling, down 20% this year and hitting its lowest level since September 2024. Investors who once rode the AI boom are now watching nervously as Trump’s tariffs threaten to derail the industry.

Optimize Your Investment Research with Spark
Effectively assess a stock's risks and opportunities with a clear breakdown of its positive and negative factors.
Uncover insightful assessments of a stock's market performance and potential with a comprehensive competitor analysis .Nvidia’s fate hinges on how the AI market reacts to geopolitical turmoil. If Trump walks back the tariffs, stocks could rebound. If not, investors will have to decide whether Nvidia’s AI dominance can weather the storm.

What Is the Price Prediction for NVDA Stock?
Analysts remain bullish about NVDA stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys and three Holds. Over the past year, NVDA has increased by more than 25%, and the average NVDA price target of $177.41 implies an upside potential of 63.5% from current levels.

AI Boom Clashes With Trade War
Nvidia’s financials remain strong, reporting a record $130.5 billion in revenue for Fiscal 2025, a 114% year-over-year jump. But the market isn’t celebrating. According to Barrons, Trump’s new tariffs on semiconductor imports—especially from Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its advanced chips—have investors worried about rising costs and supply chain chaos.
Analysts See Opportunity Despite the Chaos
Some analysts argue the selloff is an overreaction. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein acknowledges the market’s fear but says Nvidia’s fundamentals remain solid. MarketWatch reported that Ben Reitzes of Melius Research calls the current dip a disconnect from reality, maintaining a “Buy” rating with a price target of $170, a potential 60% upside."
2025-03-11T12:15:00Z;This Simple Investing Blunder Could Cost You 8%+ Dividends;Investing Mistakegetty I recently got some reader feedback that made me realize something: When it comes to our favorite income investments—8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs)—there are still a lot of misconceptions out there.   It’s key that we put those right, because they’re causing some investors to miss out on CEFs, and the big (and often monthly) dividends they provide. And I know I don’t have to tell you that in turbulent times like these, high payouts like those are a lifesaver.  This reader wrote in response to a recent piece I wrote about how CEFs can be better than ETFs, pointing out two things:    The three CEFs I mentioned in the piece have higher expense ratios than passive funds. There are cheaper ways to buy stocks that the CEFs I wrote about in that article own (more on them below), such as Microsoft (MSFT), a major holding of all three of these CEFs.  Let’s address both of these concerns because they are valid—and both are often cited by financial advisors and the mainstream media as reasons to avoid CEFs and invest in ETFs, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).  Following that advice can cost you significant dividends: CEFs currently yield 8.5% on average, while SPY, the largest ETF by market cap, yields a paltry 1.4%. So, let’s dig into the first issue. MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel Users‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10Microsoft’s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users  Closed-End Funds Have Higher Fees … Right? I am not going to disagree with the feedback here, because it is true. On average, CEFs have management fees of 2.9%, which sounds very high compared to what you’d pay on the average index fund.  I should note before we go further, though, that the two CEFs we’ll get into below (both of which appeared in the article)—the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO) and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)—charge much less: about 2.7% for AIO and 1.1% for STK.   The fees for the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), the other fund mentioned in that article, are about the same as STK, at 1.09%, but we’re going to focus more on the other two funds, and the opportunity we have in them, today. Here’s where our reader picked up on a common misunderstanding about CEF fees, suggesting that these fees are taken out of the income and total returns these funds provide. In other words, if the fee were to be taken out of AIO’s dividend, its 7.8% yield would actually amount to 5.1%, net of fees. But this isn’t how CEF fees work. Let’s take the most important detail first: The fees that CEFs charge are taken out of the fund’s portfolio before distributing dividends. The fund will not remove it from the yield you receive: If AIO yields 7.8%, that means you will get $780 a year for every $10,000 you invest. The fees are taken care of on the back end, before AIO reports its capital gains and pays out distributions, so all the profits I’m about to show you are net of fees. Are the fees justified? In my opinion, getting $78,000 on a million-dollar nest egg is worth it, since the low-fee alternative offers $14,000 in dividends on that same million bucks. Also, I should point out that those CEF fees tend to remain as low as possible because of competition. The fees that CEFs charge are a combination of administrative fees, payment to fund managers (which is often the smallest part of the fund’s assets, typically around 0.07%), and payment for things like leverage costs (both of these funds typically borrow money to fund investments, and AIO is currently borrowing more than STK, which is why its fees are higher). In the end, though, this one chart is why I think the fees are justified, even without accounting for these funds’ much higher yields.CEFs OutperformYcharts Both AIO (in blue) and STK (in purple) have outperformed the S&P 500 since AIO’s inception (it was released in late 2019, which is why this chart goes only that far). And STK’s outperformance goes back much further.STK Total ReturnsYcharts Now, to be sure, these funds are weighted toward tech, but it is also worth pointing out that the S&P 500 has been increasingly weighted to tech stocks (now about 45% of the index), which explains some of the outperformance here. But with fees as “high” as the ones they’re charging, you’d expect SPY to be more competitive (again net of fees). To be sure, the SPY shareholder paid less in fees. But the SPY shareholder also missed out on $1.137 of profits for every dollar they would have put into STK when it launched. Cheaper Ways to Buy Stocks? The second criticism also has some merit, although maybe not in the way the reader meant. Let me explain.CEF PremiumsYcharts Both of these funds have a fixed number of shares they issue to the general public (this is fixed at the IPO). This is why the fund is called a closed end fund. While those shares trade on exchanges, like any stock, the issuer can’t issue new shares to grow the fund. The price of a share of a CEF will fluctuate according to supply and demand, which means its market price can drift up or down from the liquidation value of all of its assets on the open market, which is called the net asset value, or NAV. Above you can see AIO is trading at a 6.5% premium to NAV as I write this, while STK’s 1.5% premium is smaller than the 10%+ premiums it’s had in the past, and is pretty close to trading at par. So, yes, you can get Microsoft cheaper than you can by buying it with AIO (by the way, MSFT is 3.24% of AIO’s portfolio, its second-largest position). How? By buying STK! But of course, these are still both premiums. Lucky for us, we can do even better, by purchasing a heavily discounted CEF like the 9.4%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a recommendation of my CEF Insider service trading at a 7.9% discount to NAV, with Microsoft as its top position, at 4% of assets, followed by NVIDIA (NVDA) at 3.3%. And check this out.Swappable CEFsYcharts See how ASG (in blue) is at that 7.9% discount as of this writing, while AIO (in purple) is at a 6.5% premium, but in 2020, ASG traded at a premium and AIO traded at a discount? If you’re thinking there’s an opportunity here to buy ASG when it’s discounted, sell when it’s at a premium, then buy AIO when it’s at a discount and do the opposite trade when AIO swings to a premium, you’re right. This isn’t just what some niche hedge funds do. It’s also the kind of move we’re always looking to make at CEF Insider. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

2025-03-11T16:11:47Z;Nvidia’s Revenue Surges on ‘Insane’ AI Demand: Can NVDA Stock Keep Up;"
NVDA
 has been at the center of the semiconductor industry since the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy began. Its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming increasingly important as demand for AI computing rises. The company reported another strong quarter and a strong end to its fiscal 2025, fueled by “insane” AI demand. Nvidia’s revenue increased from $4.6 billion in fiscal 2015 to an impressive $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025. Nvidia’s stock price has risen 1,771.6% over the last five years, reflecting this demand for its AI-centric GPUs, particularly the Blackwell architecture. 

Despite its results for fiscal 2025, Nvidia’s stock is down 18% this year, driven by recent market dynamics such as geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainties with China, which have caused some volatility.

Nonetheless, Wall Street rates this hyper-growth AI stock as a “Strong Buy,” expecting a 105% increase if it reaches the high price target of $220. The company is set to release its Blackwell Ultra and Rubin — its next-generation chip — at Nvidia’s developers conference on March 17. Let’s find out if the stock is a buy now. Fiscal 2025 Was Extraordinary for Nvidia

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue increased 78% year-over-year to $39.3 billion, while adjusted earnings increased 71% to $0.89 per share. Data Center remains the leading revenue contributor, driven by AI growth. Revenue in this segment increased by 93% to $35.6 billion, driven by strong demand for Blackwell. Revenue in the Gaming and AI PC segment fell by 11% in the fourth quarter, but this was offset by a 103% increase in Automotive and Robotics revenue and a 10% increase in Professional Visualization revenue. For the full fiscal year 2025, revenue surged 114% to $130.5 billion while adjusted earnings jumped 130% to $2.99 per share. CEO Jensen Huang stated in the quarter that the company successfully increased production of its flagship Blackwell AI supercomputer to meet rising demand for high-performance computing solutions. 

Nvidia continues to maintain a robust balance sheet despite significant investments in AI expansion. At the end of Q4, it had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $43.2 billion. It also generated free cash flow of $60.7 billion in fiscal 2025, paying out $834 million in cash dividends and $33.7 billion in share repurchases.

Headwinds Loom Over Nvidia

While Nvidia continues to perform well, trade concerns loom over the company. Investors are concerned that President Donald Trump’s stricter export restrictions, including a complete ban on H20 chips, will have a significant impact on Nvidia. Currently, China accounts for 13% of total revenue by customer billing location in fiscal 2025. Nvidia faced a similar situation earlier in 2023, when the Commerce Department restricted exports of advanced AI chips to China. However, Nvidia addressed the issue by introducing a new AI chip that complied with regulations. Nonetheless, the U.S. market accounted for the majority (47%) of total revenue in fiscal 2025, up 127% from fiscal 2024. In addition, revenue in Singapore and Taiwan increased by 246.7% and 53.5%, respectively, year on year. This is a significant accomplishment in the face of export concerns to China. Investors will have to wait and see how Nvidia handles any trade restrictions that may arise this time around.

Citi analyst Atif Malik believes that, despite these headwinds, Nvidia offers a great risk-reward opportunity because it is currently trading below its historical averages and has great long-term AI growth opportunities. Malik reiterated his “Buy” rating for the stock, with a target price of $163. 

Similarly, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter maintained the same outlook, with a price target of $175. Cowen believes that healthcare will be Nvidia’s most significant AI opportunity in the coming years. He labeled the company ""The Accelerated Computing Leader,"" claiming that its “suite of superior technology, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments” will result in massive long-term returns. Furthermore, many industry analysts even predict Nvidia will grow to be $10 trillion in market cap within the next decade.

Analysts that cover Nvidia expect revenue and earnings to increase by 56.3% and 50.3% in fiscal 2026. Revenue and earnings could further increase by 22.2% and 27.6%, in fiscal 2027, respectively. Currently, Nvidia trades at 23 times forward 2026 earnings, lower than its five-year historical average P/E of 71.7x.

What Is the Target Price for Nvidia Stock Now?

On Wall Street, Nvidia stock remains a “Strong Buy.” Out of the 44 analysts covering the stock, 38 have a “Strong Buy” recommendation, two say it’s a “Moderate Buy,” and four rate it a “Hold.” The average target price of $177.59 suggests Nvidia stock can climb by 66% from current levels. Plus, the high price estimate of $220 implies an upside potential of 105.6% over the next 12 months.
Nvidia’s upcoming GTC conference will provide insight into its future innovations. Despite current market pessimism, discussions about upcoming products such as the Blackwell Ultra and Rubin chips may reignite investor interest. Huang is optimistic that “AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.”
Given that the stock is currently fairly valued, Nvidia remains a top AI pick for the long term."

2025-03-12T03:43:00Z;Will Nvidia stock keep dropping in 2025?;"With shares down 20% year to date, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been off to a bad start in 2025, even though its chip business continues to fire on all cylinders. Is the market predicting an end to the generative artificial intelligence (AI) hype cycle? Let's dig deeper to determine what the next nine months might have in store for the industry's leader.

Fourth-quarter earnings were not bad
When a company's stock starts falling, it's easy to blame poor operational performance. But that hasn't been the case for Nvidia. Fourth-quarter earnings show a business that is still firing on all cylinders. Revenue soared 78% from a year ago to a quarterly record of $39.3 billion, driven by strength in the company's data center segment, where it makes advanced AI chips for running and training large language models (LLMs).

While Nvidia started as a gaming chip designer, expensive data center hardware has become its bread and butter. Its latest AI chip, Blackwell, is estimated to cost a whopping $30,000 to $50,000 per unit. But these new products boast dramatic improvements in power and efficiency compared to their predecessors, potentially allowing clients to save money using them. According to CEO Jensen Huang, demand is ""insane.""
That said, everything isn't peaches and cream. Nvidia experienced a three-point drop in fourth-quarter gross margins (to 73%), but that was likely because of temporary challenges associated with the rollout of its new Blackwell chips. Management expects the trend to continue in the first quarter, with gross margins dropping to 71% as it ramps up production.
The market isn't impressed
At the time of writing, Nvidia's shares are down 14% from the release of earnings on Feb. 26. This dip suggests the market isn't very impressed with the company despite its high growth rate and the successful rollout of its Blackwell chips. Some might blame this on the falling gross margins. However, the bigger challenge may come from long-term demand.

In February, Microsoft shocked the tech world when it scrapped some leases for data centers in the U.S. The software giant is believed to be one of Nvidia's top consumers, and a reduction in its data center capacity could indicate a desire to reduce its exposure to the industry.

While Microsoft probably won't give up on AI, its CEO, Satya Nadella, suggests the technology isn't creating much meaningful value yet. If one of the industry leaders says this openly, other Nvidia clients (such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms) may feel the same way behind the scenes.

Further alarm bells are coming from another major Nvidia client, OpenAI. Last month, the generative AI start-up finalized a design with TSMC to make its own custom chips to reduce its reliance on third-party suppliers. Custom chips are designed for specialized workloads, so they have fewer unnecessary components, making them cheaper and more efficient compared to the one-size-fits-all GPUs typically provided by Nvidia.

If major clients scale back their AI investments and turn to custom chips, Nvidia's growth potential could be seriously eroded.

What's next for Nvidia?
With a market cap of $2.6 trillion, Nvidia is already a huge company. And future upside looks limited, especially as investors become more concerned with challenges like falling gross margins and potential demand erosion. That said, shares also look unlikely to crash in 2025.
With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 25.5, Nvidia shares are valued only slightly higher than the Nasdaq-100 estimate of 25, making them quite affordable and reducing the risk of downside. The stock is likely to remain flat this year unless there is a severe deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession."

2025-03-14T09:00:34Z;Nvidia Stock To $60?;NVDA StockTrefis Trefis  Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 60% or more in the upcoming months? Although this might seem extreme, such an occurrence has happened before and could repeat itself. Earlier this year, Nvidia stock experienced a sell-off, dropping from approximately $148 in mid-January to around $115 now, which represents a nearly 23% decrease. This decline has been fueled by several factors, such as the introduction of more resource-efficient AI models like China’s DeepSeek and worries that decelerating investments in generative AI might reduce the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Additionally, the overall market is undergoing a significant sell-off, spurred by increasing concerns about a U.S. recession following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. Separately, see Is A New CEO Enough To Get Intel Back On Track?  Here’s the point: The key takeaway is that during a downturn, NVDA stock might incur substantial losses. Data from 2022 indicates that NVDA stock lost more than 60% of its value in only a few quarters. Currently, Nvidia stock has decreased from $148 to $115 in roughly two months. This raises the question: could the stock continue its downward trend and reach approximately $60 if a similar situation were to unfold? Naturally, individual stocks are generally more volatile than diversified portfolios. Therefore, if you are looking for growth with reduced volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its inception.   Why Is It Relevant Now? Slowdown in AI Demand: Over the last two years, companies have significantly invested in training AI models, with Nvidia’s GPUs becoming the preferred option due to their performance and efficiency. The short-term outlook remains robust, as tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are increasing capital expenditures for 2025 to expand their AI cloud infrastructures. Nevertheless, demand may eventually taper off. Since AI model training is predominantly a one-time, compute-intensive process, it could eventually decelerate. As models increase in size, incremental performance improvements are anticipated to diminish, and the supply of high-quality training data might become a limiting factor. Consequently, as the demand for training declines, GPU sales could also decrease. Therefore, as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture, the U.S. economy might enter a downturn, potentially even a recession, which could further affect GPU sales. Because AI investments continue to be unprofitable for most companies, they may be prime candidates for cost-cutting measures during an economic downturn. This situation could significantly impact Nvidia.  The transition to more resource-efficient AI models could also affect Nvidia. China’s DeepSeek model, launched in January, attracted attention for prioritizing software-driven optimization instead of relying on hardware, which could potentially reduce the demand for GPUs. The company reports that it spent only $5.5 million to train its V3 model, which is only a fraction of the hundreds of millions that firms such as OpenAI are said to have spent. Since DeepSeek’s model is open source, major tech companies might adopt similar cost-cutting strategies. If this approach is widely implemented, it could further reduce the demand for AI computing power. For further information, see how DeepSeek impacts Nvidia   The U.S. government has imposed export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s latest AI chipset products destined for China, with the exception of the H20 chips, citing national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are using entities registered outside of China to purchase servers equipped with Nvidia’s latest products from companies in various countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This is particularly concerning as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, generating approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25 (around 18% of revenue), compared to only $2.3 billion (8% of revenue) in FY’23. Singapore has now initiated an investigation into these potential loopholes. Such developments could potentially affect Nvidia’s overall revenue to some degree.

NVDA stock has experienced a decline that was marginally more severe than that of the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Are you concerned about how a market crash might affect NVDA stock? Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a detailed analysis of the stock’s performance during and following previous market crashes.   Inflation Shock (2022) • NVDA stock declined by 62.7% from a peak of $30.12 on 3 January 2022 to $11.23 on 16 October 2022, compared to a 25.4% peak-to-trough drop for the S&P 500   • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 17 May 2023   • Since then, it has risen to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and is currently trading at approximately $115 COVID Pandemic (2020) • NVDA stock dropped by 37.6% from a high of $7.87 on 19 February 2020 to $4.91 on 16 March 2020, compared to a 33.9% decline for the S&P 500   • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 11 May 2020 Global Financial Crisis (2008) • NVDA stock declined by 85.1% from a high of $0.99 on 17 October 2007 to $0.15 on 20 November 2008, compared to a 56.8% drop for the S&P 500   • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 13 May 2016 Valuation NVIDIA’s Revenues have soared, increasing at an average rate of 80.1% over the past three years, which is significantly higher than the 6.3% increase in S&P 500 revenues. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s valuation remains attractive given its strong growth, with the stock trading at approximately 26x consensus FY’26 earnings. Yet, there are some potential risks. In recent quarters, net margins have exceeded an impressive 50%, propelled by robust pricing power and high demand for AI chips. Still, these margins could be at risk if demand declines or if competition intensifies. A slowdown in demand could result in reduced pricing, lower sales volumes, and a significant decline in profitability.

2025-03-15T14:02:00Z;This 15.6% Dividend Is A Smart ‘Buy The Dip’ Play;"Buy on the dipgetty There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you’re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home.  The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker—and really grabbed contrarians’ attention in the process.   Let’s start with what’s really going on with this wild market.  The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don’t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline.  Short-Term Dips Against a Long-Term Bull Backdrop Even so, the volatility we’ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market DipYcharts Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel Users‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10Microsoft’s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users  COVID Has Reduced the Odds We’ll See Another 2008 During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it’s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19.  This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative.   And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds—so-called “quantitative easing”) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it’s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they’re not likely to collapse. Buying the Dip In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can’t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there’s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our “dip-buying discount” by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That’s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund’s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the “term” refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don’t pay much attention to the “term” in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately:BTX Discount NarrowsYcharts Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX’s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund’s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund’s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There’s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. From BIGZ to “Bigger X” The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn’t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple).Small Caps LagYcharts This wasn’t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn’t as “big-focused” as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX’s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.

But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.”AdvertisementHuang added that he expects Nvidia to play “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting “there as fast as possible.”Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all recently unveiled quantum computing chips that they say show promise for the advent of large-scale quantum computing.

The next Blackwell Ultra NVL72 chips, which will have one-and-a-half times more memory and two times more bandwidth, will be used to accelerate building AI agents, physical AI, and reasoning models, Huang said during his keynote address. Blackwell Ultra will be available in the second half of this year.AdvertisementThe chipmaker’s next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs will be released in the second half of next year, Huang said, followed by Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027. Rubin Ultra will be four GPUs connected together on a single chip. AdvertisementThe next AI chip architecture will be named Feynman, Huang said, and is slated for 2028.“The rate of innovation on all fronts continues to impress and suggests a growing moat versus peers,” Jefferies (JEF-6.89%) analysts said in a note on Wednesday. “However, the updated roadmap does suggest Rubin will only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.”AdvertisementRichard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, shared similar sentiments in a Wednesday note saying that the Rubin launch “promises another big jump over Blackwell, but smaller than the jump Blackwell made over Hopper.”However, Windsor said the chipmaker “is showing no sign of slowing down meaning that it is quickly expanding into any area where AI will be relevant with the strategy to become the industry standard” before its competitors can start to catch up.AdvertisementWhile this will help Nvidia keep its market dominance, having more than 85% of market share for data center chips will keep it “a hostage to end demand,” leading to some “tough quarters when the inevitable correction comes,” Windsor said. He added that there are no signs of this yet, as AI-focused companies plan to continue spending tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year.Bank of America (BAC-4.16%) analysts maintained their “buy” rating for Nvidia, and said they are looking forward to Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra, which show “unmatched roadmap as Rubin advances AI performance 900x (scale-up FLOPs) over Hopper (Blackwell is 68x) in TCO optimized way,” in a note on Wednesday.AdvertisementMeanwhile, Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives said in a post-conference note on Tuesday that demand for Nvidia’s GPUs “remains extremely robust” and “is currently outstripping supply 15:1” as enterprises wait to receive their AI chips. “In essence, Nvidia’s chips remain the new oil or gold in this world for the tech ecosystem as there is only one chip in the world fueling this AI foundation ... and it’s Nvidia,” Wedbush said.

In July 2024, chief innovation officer Lawrence Kim said Yum had been testing AI voice technology for two years. By then, over 100 Taco Bell drive-thrus in 13 states had already implemented the technology. As the AI race intensifies among tech giants, restaurants are increasingly adopting the technology to stay competitive.

This partnership marks Nvidia’s first venture into the restaurant sector. It also signals a strategic shift for Yum, which has historically built its tech operations through acquisitions. By partnering with Nvidia, Yum will own the AI intelligence created, allowing it to customize the technology to its needs.

2025-03-20T21:48:02Z;HCA Healthcare Is One Healthy Business;CHINA - 2024/06/23: In this photo illustration, the American healthcare business HCA Healthcare ... More (NYSE: HCA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images One of the biggest losers from the Mag 7 during earnings season was Nvidia (NVDA). I called a top for NVDA back in August 2024 and am not surprised to see it fall precipitously after reporting excellent earnings. The narrative that valuation does not matter is being disproved before our very eyes – along with many other false narratives that have plagued our society. If you’ve been following my reports on the company’s stock, you would know that the recent drop in price is still not nearly enough to make the stock attractive.   NVDA is not alone. Crowded trades and overvalued stocks are everywhere. Good stocks are harder and harder to find as the market was hitting new highs. Accordingly, I see opportunity in market pull backs. I see a golden era for stocks over the next couple of years as markets exorcise more false narratives (remember NFTs…haha) and embrace fundamentals again.  Meanwhile, my firm’s proven-superior research continues to give an edge in finding good stocks. I work harder and smarter with my firm’s Robo-Analyst AI to scour the markets and the data to identify the stocks, ETFs and mutual funds with the best risk/reward.   I previously made HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA) a Long Idea in June 2020, and have reiterated my bullish view on the stock many times. Since my original report, HCA has outperformed as a Long Idea by 137%, rising 224% while the S&P is up 87%. Even after outpacing the overall market, HCA Healthcare remains a strong business and very attractive stock.  HCA offers favorable Risk/Reward based on the company’s:  consistent top- and bottom-line growth, growing patient and hospital numbers, strong position as the industry leader, high dividend and share repurchase yields on shares, and cheap stock valuation.  What’s Working MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel Users‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10Microsoft’s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users  Consistently Growing Fundamentals HCA Healthcare has steadily grown its top- and bottom-line since 2007.  HCA Healthcare has grown revenue by 6% and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 8% compounded annually since 2007. See Figure 1. The company has improved its NOPAT margin from 10.2% in 2007 to 11.9% in 2024 while increasing invested capital turns from 1.32 to 1.48 over the same time. Rising operational and capital efficiency drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 13% in 2007 to 18% in 2024.   Figure 1: HCA Healthcare’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2007HCA Revenue & NOPAT 2007-2024New Constructs, LLC Patient Admissions and Hospital Locations on the Rise Year-over-year (YoY) in 2024, HCA Healthcare’s:  same facility revenue increased 7.9% same facility admissions increased 4.9% same facility inpatient surgical volumes increased 2.2% same facility emergency room visits increased 4.9%  Longer-term, the company has grown its admissions (general measure of inpatient volume) YoY in 8 out of the last 10 years. HCA Healthcare’s total admissions grew from 1.8 million in 2014 to 2.2 million in 2024, or 2% compounded annually. Over the same time, the company has expanded the number of hospitals it operates from 166 to 190. See Figure 2. Figure 2: HCA Healthcare’s Number of Admissions and Hospitals: 2014 – 2024HCA Admissions & Hospitals 2014-2024New Constructs, LLC Medical Spending Tailwinds Hospital operators, such as HCA Healthcare, benefit from consistent, and long-term, tailwinds of an aging population and rising healthcare costs. In 2022, 17% of the U.S population was 65 years or older. That percentage is expected to increase to 22% by 2040. The population of those aged 85+ is also expected to double from 2022 to 2040. As populations age, healthcare spending increases. In fact, per capita healthcare spending for those aged 65-84 is 1.6x higher than those aged 45-64 and 3.1x higher than those aged 19-44. Rising spend from an aging population drives projections for continued growth in hospital spending. According to the Peterson KFF Health System Tracker, the annual hospital spending is expected to grow:  4.8% in 2025 4.6% in 2026 5.9% in 2027 5.7% in 2028 5.8% in 2029 5.4% in 2030 5.3% in 2031 5.4% in 2032  With its industry leading position and superior profitability (more on that below), HCA Healthcare is well-positioned to capitalize on steady growth in healthcare spending for years to come. Attractive Dividend and Repurchase Yield Since 2018, HCA Healthcare has paid $3.8 billion (5% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.35/share in February 2018 to $0.72/share in March 2025. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.8% yield. HCA also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. From 2018 through 2024, the company repurchased $28.1 billion (34% of market cap) of shares. $16.9 billion of this repurchase activity occurred from 2022-2024. In January 2025, HCA Healthcare’s board of directors authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program. Management noted in the 4Q24 earnings call that they “anticipate completing a significant portion in 2025.” Should the company repurchase shares at its 2024 rate, it would repurchase $6.0 billion of shares in 2025, which equals 7.3% of the current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 8.1%. Long Track Record of Quality Cash Flow Generation HCA generates enough free cash flow (FCF) to cover both its share repurchases and regular dividend payments. From 2018 to 2024, HCA generated $30.9 billion in FCF while paying $3.8 billion in dividends and $28.1 billion in repurchases, for total capital return of $31.9 billion. I like companies that choose to return so much capital to shareholders instead of spending it on executive bonuses or acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: HCA Healthcare’s Free Cash Flow Vs. Cash Dividends Paid: 2018 Through 2024HCA FCF and Dividends 2018-2024New Constructs, LLC HCA Healthcare has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) in every year of my model on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, the company has generated positive FCF in 46 of the past 52 quarters. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare generated $30.9 billion (23% of enterprise value) in FCF. See Figure 4. Figure 4: HCA Healthcare’s Cumulative FCF Since 2018HCA Free Cash Flow 2018-2024New Constructs, LLC Proven Industry Leader HCA Healthcare was the most profitable healthcare company amongst its peers when I originally wrote my Long Idea report, and it remains #1 today. It is also the largest hospital operator by revenue and number of locations. HCA Healthcare’s ROIC and invested capital turns are higher than all peers, while the company’s NOPAT margin surpasses all but one of its publicly traded competitors. Competitors in this analysis include Encompass Health (EHC), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Universal Health Services (UHS), and more, per Figure 5. Figure 5: HCA Healthcare’s Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM)HCA Profitability vs CompetitorsNew Constructs, LLC What’s Not Working Skilled Labor Is Hard to Come by in Healthcare Skilled labor in the healthcare industry remains in short supply. Job satisfaction for Registered Nurses (RN) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) remains low since COVID-19 due to increased levels of stress and excessive work hours. Many nurses also left the workforce after Covid. Worse yet, a significant segment of the nursing workforce is nearing retirement age, while too few new nurses are entering the workforce. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), nursing enrollment is not growing fast enough to meet the projected demand for RN and APRN services. Hiring enough labor continues to be a headwind for the whole healthcare industry, including HCA. However, the company is taking steps to recruit and retain quality employees. In the 4Q24 earnings call, management noted that employee engagement is “at an all-time high”, which has allowed the company to “reduce turnover and improve the capabilities of our facilities with having continuity and staffing…” Furthermore, the company continues to hire nurses from Galen College, one of the largest nursing schools in the U.S., in which HCA Healthcare acquired a majority stake in 2020. Unknown Costs of Tariffs The cost of goods is rising, and the potential for newly administered tariffs to drive costs even higher remains a risk for many companies. In the 4Q24 earnings call, HCA Healthcare management noted that they’ve been working on tariff mitigation strategies for years to manage the cost of supplies needed to operate its hospitals. Importantly, management noted that in 2025, 70% of its supplies are already contracted with firm pricing, which could help mitigate any increased supply cost when and if mass tariffs are enacted. Importantly, HCA Healthcare is already priced as if tariffs and labor costs will hurt the business and result in deteriorating profitability. Management’s ability to mitigate these challenges creates increased upside in shares, as I’ll show below. Shares Are Pricing in Zero Growth Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for HCA. At its current price, HCA’s price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio is 1.0, which means the market expects its NOPAT to never grow from current levels. For context, HCA has grown its NOPAT by 8% compounded annually since 2014 and 7% compounded annually since 2007. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume:  NOPAT margin immediately falls to 9% (equal to lowest ever NOPAT margin vs.12% in 2024 and average of the past five years) through 2034, and revenue grows at 4% a year through 2034 (compared to 7% compounded annually in the last five and ten years) then  the stock is worth $319/share today – nearly equal to the current stock price. For reference, the revenue growth in this scenario would be below consensus expectations of 5.7% growth in 2025 and 5.1% growth in 2026. In this scenario, HCA’s NOPAT grows just 1% compounded annually from 2025 – 2034, which is well below historical growth rates. Shares Could Go 36%+ Higher at Consensus Growth Rates If I instead assume:  NOPAT margin immediately falls to 10% through 2034, revenue grows at consensus rates in 2025 (5.7%), 2026 (5.1%), and 2027 (5.3%), and revenue grows at 2027 consensus rate (5.5%) each year thereafter through 2034, then  the stock is worth $435/share today – a 36% upside to the current price. In this scenario, HCA’s NOPAT would grow 4% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. Should the company’s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside.

2025-03-23T11:00:00Z;Five Critical Indicators To Gauge Recession Risk;The decline in stock prices combined with plunging consumer sentiment and uncertainty surrounding ... More tariffs has uncreased uncertainty about future economic growth. Since stock prices ultimately depend on earnings, the pace of economic growth is crucial input to future stock performance.getty After briefly hitting correction territory in the previous week, which is defined as a 10% decline from an earlier high, stocks had a modest rebound last week. The S&P 500 sits 7.6% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of 18.5% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks stems from an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs.  Market ReturnsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Stock Correction: Implications Of A 10% Decline In Stock Prices With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high on Thursday, March 13, stocks officially entered a correction. In the twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism regarding future returns. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%.  Average Stock Returns After S&P 500 CorrectionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Weakening Economic Forecasts The strong bond between avoiding recession and better returns following a stock correction makes monitoring the economy's health even more critical. Economists' consensus estimate of 2025 economic growth has dipped slightly to 2.2%, nowhere near recessionary levels. Unfortunately, economists have a poor track record of accurately predicting economic growth with enough lead time, and consensus estimates tend to lag behind real-time data.  Consensus U.S. Economic Growth ForecastsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  Economic models attempting to forecast the current quarter of GDP growth were developed to address the challenges associated with consensus estimates. These estimates adapt to the most recent economic releases to predict growth. This methodology has its challenges but adds additional color to the economic backdrop. The Atlanta Fed model points to a contraction in economic activity in the first quarter, which is probably overstated because much of that downward estimate comes from a marked increase in imports to avoid future tariffs. The St. Louis Fed’s model remains in positive territory. The forecast difference between the two is vast for their first-quarter GDP estimate. After last week's Federal Reserve meeting, the committee noted that “uncertainty around the economy outlook has increased.”    Estimated Frist-Quarter U.S. Economic GrowthGlenview Trust, Bloomberg High-Frequency Recession Indicators While accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging, monitoring some high-frequency data can help get an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators were chosen because they are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available monthly, sometimes with a significant time lag. MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel UsersTrump Approval Rating Tracker: Three Post-Tariff Surveys Show Decline‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10 Jobs The labor market is probably the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. While initial claims are above the lows, the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or at a level consistent with economic woes.Initial Jobless ClaimsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. This indicates that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find a new one. Remember that the number of employees in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The bottom line is that the labor market is softening but has not yet reached recessionary levels.Continuing ClaimsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Credit Spreads The corporate bond market should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn.Corporate Bond SpreadsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Financial Conditions The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels.Financial ConditionsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Cyclical Stock Performance The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn’t at the level seen before past recessions.Performance Of Cyclical StocksGlenview Truat, Bloomberg Yield Curve The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession.The Yield Curve & RecessionsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg What To Watch This Week The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June.Number Of Fed Rate Cuts ExpectedGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Conclusions Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID-19 period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty. So, investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

2025-03-25T13:53:00Z;3 Big Dividends That Have Proven The ‘Experts’ Wrong Again;"MISTAKES TO AVOIDgetty Here’s some good news in these uncertain times: Most investors who’ve invested for the long haul are well-equipped to deal with this selloff. That’s because, over the last five years, stocks have been on an absolute tear.   In that period, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual total return of 19.1%, as of this writing. That’s more than double the average of about 8% in the last century.  Looking At Various Timeframes Can Skew Our View Think back five years for a moment. Back then, the stock market’s prospects looked bleak, indeed, as we were at the beginning of the pandemic-driven selloff. In the middle of March 2020, lockdowns had just begun in the U.S. (the first one was on March 16, in San Francisco, and March 19 was the first statewide lockdown).  Thinking back to that troubled period highlights something important to remember when it comes to investing: Be careful not to take the current circumstances and project them over the long run, because historically the market’s long-term direction is up, especially over periods much longer than five years.   Early 2020 also tells us something when it comes to trying to discern if the stock market is overpriced or underpriced: Just looking at a certain time period of stock returns to try to tell whether or not stocks are a bargain is misleading because of something called base effects.  In other words, your returns will be impacted by where you start looking, which can sometimes cause some big distortions. Hot Performers In A Hot Market That’s always good to bear in mind, of course. But it’s still interesting to look at periods of extreme outperformance and tease out those assets that did better still. Finding one might lead us to a real gem—especially if we can pick it up at a bargain. MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel Users‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10Microsoft’s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users  With that in mind, let’s look at some funds—high-yielding closed-end funds, to be precise—that actually returned more than 19.1% annualized in the last five years.  This is important because many wealth advisors and market gurus say that actively managed funds can’t beat the market. Yet these three funds can—and have—even in an extremely hot market like the one we saw after COVID-19 got real.   I should be honest and say right now that the reason for this outperformance is that these funds invest in corners of the market that have dominated in that time, as well as assets beyond the S&P 500. These are the main reasons why they’ve outperformed. But this precisely points to why diversifying across both sectors and assets is a proven strategy—it gives us exposure to some outperformance, even in the best of times. That, in turn, boosts the value of our overall portfolio in the long term while helping cushion us from sudden, nasty downturns like the one at the start of the pandemic. Or, for that matter, the one we’re seeing now. Plus, these three funds have another compelling feature: big dividends. Two of them yield over 6%, and one yields 9.5%, so you can see how they don’t just give us the ability to diversify—they also give us the opportunity for a massive income stream that index funds just can’t offer. The benchmark S&P 500 index fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), for example, yields just 1.2%. So, let’s jump in, starting with the “worst” performer of our trio and wrapping up with our best. Market-Beating CEF #1: A 6.3%-Paying Tech Fund Returning 25% Annualized Our first fund returned an astounding 205% over the last five years. That’s mainly because the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) focuses on tech stocks: Broadcom (AVGO), NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are all top holdings. With that in mind, its outperformance is no surprise. But unlike most tech funds, STK yields 6.3%—actually on the low side for CEFs, which yield around 8% on average. Even so this fund remains an unusually powerful way to draw a healthy income stream from the reality of tech encroaching on every part of our lives. There’s just one issue here: When it comes to CEFs, we always strive to buy when a fund is trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) and STK trades near par as I write this. This may mean STK will see a market-price decline to bring it to the kind of valuation its peers have. But if this smartly run fund hits a 5% discount to NAV or greater, I see it a “no-brainer” buy. Market-Beating CEF #2: An Energy Fund Dropping A 9.5% Payout The 31.9% annualized return we’ve seen from the Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO), which yields 9.5% today, is astounding on its surface. But if you think for a second, it makes sense: Oil was crashing five years ago and actually hit negative prices a couple weeks after the pandemic began. So crude had nowhere to go but up! And the large cap energy stocks this fund holds—PEO currently has ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and EOG Resources (EOG)—naturally benefited. Plus, this fund’s massive 11.7% discount to NAV is a strong value for that huge income stream, which essentially turns gains from energy stocks into income without you having to buy and sell these stocks yourself. No question about it: Brave contrarians who chose this well-run energy fund five years ago have enjoyed strong gains and healthy income. The fact that we can still get in at a discount means PEO still has appeal, despite that strong run. Market-Beating CEF #3: Massive Returns At An Unusual Discount This last fund is our top performer of the three, and what a performance it’s been. If you’re unfamiliar with PIMCO, it’s a specialist investment firm that operates in the bond market and has a lot of funds that outperform their indices; in the world of credit, it’s considered one of the best, if not the best, there is. So the outperformance of the PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX) isn’t too surprising, but the size of that outperformance certainly is. An unbelievable 47.3% annualized return over the last five years, as of this writing, makes PDX an unquestionably powerful wealth builder. But five years ago, you had to be very brave to buy it. Consider that PDX invests in junk bonds, and buying at the start of a global pandemic, during which bankruptcies were expected to be the norm, took an iron-willed contrarian indeed. As I write this, PDX yields 6%. And it’s worth noting that the fund’s payouts have been volatile since its inception in 2019. However, it currently trades at a 6.8% discount, which is unusual for a PIMCO fund (most trade at a premium), so we’ve got an extra margin of safety and an opportunity for discount-driven upside, too, even after this fund’s incredible five-year run.

That creates a situation where the Fed is torn between curtailing price gains and supporting growth.Advertisement“Today’s report highlights the difficult predicament the Fed is now confronting,” Citigroup (C-5.18%) economists wrote. “Ultimately, we expect Fed officials to dovishly lean toward their full-employment mandate, but that would depend on upcoming data and in particular on ... March spending and inflation.”AdvertisementTrump’s trade war is also weighing on investors. The 25% tariffs on all car, truck, and auto part imports that the president announced Wednesday evening continued to depress automakers’ stocks Friday, with Stellantis (STLA-11.91%) dropping 4.1%, Ford (F-4.53%) down 2%, and General Motors (GM-5.14%) off 1.1%.

The company has scrambled to update its product line to compete with trendier brands, Reuters (TRI-1.54%) reported.AdvertisementChris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, said he was surprised by the relatively benign market reaction to the auto tariffs, which were more hawkish than he’d anticipated. He now expects new duties on April 2 to also be hawkish, possibly followed by another muted reaction from investors.Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers will probably wait longer to see the impact of Trump’s tariffs, especially on inflation, before making any decision on cutting rates, Grisanti told Quartz.Advertisement“The only way I see Trump getting the Fed on his side is if he tanks the economy,” Grisanti said. “We can slice and dice these economic numbers as much as we want, but the Fed is on hold until we get some tariff clarity.”

2025-03-29T15:59:00Z;These 100-Year-Old Funds Are Kicking Out Near-10% Dividends;Different yield and maturities for bonds and interest on stock exchange screen.getty Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen a quiet trend in investing—and today we’re going to tap into it with two funds with near 10% dividends.  That’s right: enough to pay you back just shy of 10% of your initial buy a year in dividends alone.   What’s more, these two income plays—closed-end funds, to be precise—have been around for nearly a century, with one dating from 1927 and the other having launched in 1929. That last date, of course, is notorious, as it heralded the start of the worst market crash in history.  I bring these two CEFs up now because their long institutional memory gives them a level of reliability that few other funds can match. And there’s something else that favors both of them now, too—that quiet shift I mentioned earlier. I’m talking about the move from growth stocks to value stocks that’s started to pick up momentum in recent months.   We can catch a hint of that when we look at the performance of the large caps in the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared to small caps, as shown below by their benchmark index funds: the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA), in orange below, and the small-cap-focused iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple:Large Caps OutperformYcharts MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel Users‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10Microsoft’s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users  That nicely sets the table for our two centenarian funds. ‘Centenarian’ CEF Pick No. 1: General American Investors Company (GAM) The General American Investors Company is the oldest of our two CEFs, but not by much. It’s been around since 1927 and holds reliable cash cows like Republic Services (RSG), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A).  The fund has delivered an annualized return of 8.9% over the past decade, as of this writing. It’s caught our attention now because, at my CEF Insider service, one of the things we look for is a fund with what I like to call “discount momentum.”   That’s where a CEF’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio) is still wide but is slowly moving toward par. And that’s the setup we have with GAM now. Take a look.GAM Discount to NAVYcharts Currently, GAM trades at a massive 13.3% discount, as you can see above, and that discount has been shrinking over the last year as market volatility prompts more investors to favor value over growth. In the past year, GAM has also paid out a 9.3% dividend, which is a massive amount of income for one fund. Now it is true, that most of the fund’s income is paid out in one big yearly special dividend, so you’ll have to hold on to the fund for a full year to be guaranteed the full payout. But that’s a good thing: At CEF Insider, we see funds as something to be held for the long term. ‘Centenarian’ CEF Pick No. 2: Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX) Our second fund, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX) was launched just a couple years after GAM, in 1929. That, of course, sent it headlong into the biggest market crash of them all, and the Great Depression. But that experience was the start of the fund’s build-up of the institutional memory that still helps guide its decisions today. That’s a big part of the reason why we bought ADX in one of our first issues of CEF Insider, back in July 2017. Since then, it has delivered a 193% total return for us, as of this writing, showing its long-term mettle. ADX and GAM take similar approaches, with Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple being common top positions, but ADX also has a large holding of NVIDIA (NVDA), which is part of the reason why the fund has posted a bigger “NAV return” (or the performance of its underlying portfolio, including dividends collected) over the last decade. (ADX’s total NAV return is in orange below.)ADX Outperforms GAMYcharts ADX’s strategy isn’t too risky, though, as it emphasizes investing in high-quality, large-cap companies, ensuring both growth potential and dividend reliability. Plus, its total dividend yield of 10.9% for 2024, combined with a relatively low management fee (for a CEF) of only 0.61%, makes ADX one of the cheaper CEFs on the fee front. On average, these funds have fees around 2% on average. What’s unusual about ADX is that it has outperformed the market over the last decade and, over the last couple of years, the gap between its profits and those of the S&P 500—shown by the performance of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in orange below, has grown wider:ADX Outperforms SPYYcharts ADX should trade at a premium for delivering these gains, yet it sports at an 11.4% discount as I write this. That means there’s upside as this “secret” income monster becomes more widely known. The move from growth to value, which we discussed with GAM above, should also help ADX move on to more people’s radar. A Strategy For Using ADX Or GAM To Build Long-Term Wealth At this point, you might be wondering which fund is ideal: the cheaper GAM or the higher-performing ADX? Ultimately, what matters with CEFs is that we combine the best funds in different asset classes—and funds with different investment strategies—while maintaining a high level of quality among our picks. That way, when one falters due to a selloff, you can rebalance toward that dip-buying opportunity as another CEF outperforms. CEFs are particularly useful for this kind of rebalancing due to their high dividends (yields average around 8% as I write this). You’ll not only compound your returns by following this approach—you’ll build up a healthy income stream over time, too. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

2025-03-30T12:15:52Z;Liberation Day: Market Implications Of Tariffs;According to Strategas Research Partners, the size of the contemplated tariffs to be announced on ... More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Getty Images While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day,” scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five-percentage-point increase in tariffs trims 1% to 2% from S&P 500 earnings growth. So, Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP.   U.S. Trade China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 MonthsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets.  Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP. If sizable tariffs crimp their net exports to the U.S., as would be expected, their economic growth will suffer.   The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs this week. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. If value-added taxes are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S.Glenview Trust, Bloomberg   MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel Users‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10Trump Approval Rating Tracker: Three Post-Tariff Surveys Show Decline Tariffs: Policy Uncertainty President Trump’s use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it.U.S. Policy UncertaintyGlenview Trust, Bloomberg According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism.Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy UncertaintyGlenview Trust, Strategas Research Partners Market Reaction After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December.Market ReturnsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn’t yet at levels seen before past recessions.Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive StocksGlenview Trust, Bloomberg What To Watch This Week Beyond Wednesday’s highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday’s monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness.U.S. Unemployment RateGlenview Trust, Bloomberg While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week’s releases.Number Of Fed Rate Cuts ExpectedGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Dealing With Uncertainty If you own your stocks as an investment — just like you’d own an apartment, house, or a farm — look at them as a business. – Warren Buffett Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham’s most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a “silent partner” in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company’s intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market’s fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a “margin of safety” enable investors to ignore the market’s emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the “margin of safety” meant buying at a price below the “indicated or appraised value,” which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Conclusion Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week’s tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn’t avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.

2025-03-31T09:00:00Z;Nvidia Hit Hard By China?;NVDA StockTrefis Nvidia stock has fallen around 5% in the past week and is currently down nearly 12% over the last month. So, what has triggered the recent sell-off in Nvidia shares?   China Headwinds for Nvidia Trefis Nvidia is facing mixed developments in China. According to the Financial Times, China's National Development and Reform Commission has introduced new energy-efficiency standards for advanced chips used in data centers. These new regulations could effectively prevent Nvidia’s H20 chip from being used by Chinese firms expanding or building new data centers. The H20 is Nvidia’s leading chip tailored for China, featuring scaled-back capabilities to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors. Compared to Nvidia’s top-tier Blackwell processors available elsewhere, the H20 is less advanced.   Resellers operating in the gray market have reportedly been using entities registered outside of China to acquire Nvidia’s newest chips, including the Blackwell GPUs—which are prohibited from being sold to Chinese customers—via companies based in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Recently, Singapore charged three individuals in connection with a fraud case involving the suspected resale of Nvidia chips through Malaysia to China. Under pressure from the U.S., Malaysia is now working with both the U.S. and Singapore to monitor the distribution of Nvidia’s high-end chips and to strengthen semiconductor regulations. These concerns are particularly noteworthy, as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, contributing approximately $23 billion in revenue for FY’25 (ended January 26), accounting for 18% of total sales—an increase from $2.3 billion, or about 8% of revenue, in FY’23. In contrast, China officially made up 13% of revenue in FY’25. Increased regulatory attention on these transactions could have implications for Nvidia stock.  Data Center Demand Concerns There is increasing skepticism about the sustainability of the current AI spending surge. Evidence suggests that the massive capital allocation by major U.S. tech companies could begin to taper. In January, Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced an AI model that operates at a significantly lower cost than those of most Western competitors. This development could encourage companies to shift away from hardware-heavy strategies and focus on more efficient solutions. Moreover, returns from AI investments have been underwhelming so far, causing concern among investors—particularly if the U.S. economy weakens. With inflation expected to rise again and economic growth potentially slowing under new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, market apprehensions are growing. Reports this week noted that Microsoft canceled several data center projects across the U.S. and Europe in the last six months, citing demand not matching supply. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s Chairman Joe Tsai also recently warned of a potential bubble in AI and data center investments.  MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel Users‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10Microsoft’s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users  Preserve & Grow Wealth with Risk-Focused Quality Portfolios  The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period.   Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or will it see a strong jump? Nvidia Stock’s Volatility We currently value Nvidia stock at around $101 per share, which is roughly 10% below its current market price of $112. See our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons behind our slightly bearish view on the stock right now. One is the potential decline in the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI rally seen over the past two years, due to diminishing performance returns from increasingly large models and challenges in accessing high-quality training data. A transition toward more efficient AI models could amplify headwinds for GPU producers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia may encounter increased competition from companies such as AMD and even some of its own customers like Amazon, which are developing and deploying proprietary AI chips. While Nvidia benefits from a strong software ecosystem that complements its AI hardware—helping retain customers—it may still face pressures. At its current premium valuation, the stock might not fully account for these risks.NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Trefis Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades

General Motors (GM-4.74%) and Stellantis (STLA-11.81%) also moved lower.Advertisement“One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.”AdvertisementThat said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output.“I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” AdvertisementThe baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET.China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing.AdvertisementTrump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-3.15%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading.David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market.Advertisement“There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said."

Big Tech will be vulnerable to retaliation by the European Union.Advertisement“Trump’s tariff plan probably represents a shift for markets to quickly move from max uncertainty to max pessimism, although if countries retaliate — and Europe and China are talking like they will — rates could go up even further and drive another leg down for markets,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial (LPLA-4.75%).AdvertisementBuchbinder expects stocks to stabilize provided negotiations bear fruit and take tariff rates down, assuming markets are assured that no meaningful tariff rates will be increased because of retaliation, he wrote in an email distributed to the media.Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%), isn’t so sanguine as she expects the levies to actually go into effect as announced. “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk,” she told Quartz on Wednesday after the news.Advertisement“I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.”Trump showed no signs of backing down on Thursday, saying, “It’s going very well,” comparing the imposition of tariffs to surgery, and claiming “the markets are going to boom” along with the country. The president’s early claims that the import taxes will bring back jobs is debatable, and duties have a poor historical track record of boosting manufacturing employment.AdvertisementThe baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the EU will be slapped with 20%. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%, respectively.The large tariffs on Asian countries will weigh heavily on shoe and apparel makers, which do much of their manufacturing in the region. Shares of Nike (NKE-9.02%) plunged 14%, while those of Lululemon (LULU-6.28%) plummeted 9.6%, and those of Uggs- and Hoka-maker Deckers (DECK-6.64%) tumbled 14%. AdvertisementRestoration Hardware’s parent RH (RH-12.17%) tumbled 40% on Thursday on a double whammy of earnings and tariffs. Williams-Sonoma (WSM-6.27%) plunged 16%, and at the other end of the retail spectrum Dollar Tree (DLTR+1.54%) fell 13%.Auto uncertaintyExisting import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. General Motors (GM-4.74%), Ford (F-4.37%) and Stellantis (STLA-11.81%) nonetheless extended their declines — by 4.3%, 5.9% and 9.4%, respectively — as Canada retaliated in kind for Trump’s new 25% tariffs on cars and trucks.Advertisement“The tariff announcement was intended to give clarity on tariff policy,” Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at Cornell University, said via an email sent to the media. “Unfortunately, it has created more questions and confusion.” Stellantis has already suspended plants in Canada and Mexico, he added.  Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free from China. The shares of PDD (PDD-3.15%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.5%.AdvertisementThe Fed’s dilemmaThe the stock market — and the economy — isn’t certain to get help from the Federal Reserve in the form of an interest rate cut, given that the import taxes will probably both boost inflation and weigh on GDP growth. Economists are divided on whether the central bank will prioritize prices or full employment.AdvertisementEconomic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million.The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by  more than expected.Yardeni Research projected that PCED inflation will accelerate to 3% to 4% over the rest of this year, with the potential for a quick deterioration of the labor market. If stagflation sets in, the firm expects it to last six months to a year.Advertisement“The worst-case scenario is a recession if high tariff rates stick, leading to a slowdown in business and consumer spending that cause layoffs,” the firm wrote in a QuickTakes note. “We raised our odds of a stagflation/recession scenario from 35% to 45% on Monday.”"

Jefferies (JEF-7.69%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.”Advertisement“The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that  if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume,  its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%.Advertisement“It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.”

However, that pricing power could have less of an impact in the future, as the company hasn’t raised average selling prices.

2025-04-07T20:29:22Z;Is Nvidia Stock Worth Buying The Dip?;"Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving ... More that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation.&nbsp;SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images You can buy Nvidia stock on the cheap right now, but should you? That’s the question many investors have been asking since the once-unstoppable NVDA stock fell to its lowest P/E ratio since early 2019.   Get your answer now with this look at what happened to Nvidia, factors that could spark a rebound and risks ahead for the company.  Why Has Nvidia Stock Dropped? Nvidia stock gained 168% in the first 10 months of 2024 as investors bought up shares to get their piece of the AI boom. The stock price rally peaked in early November and then turned south when investors got nervous about lingering high interest rates.  The negative trend for Nvidia deepened in 2025 as a series of headlines prompted many to question the chip designer’s growth outlook:   DeepSeek. In January, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released an AI chatbot that requires relatively low computing power. DeepSeek's innovation, if replicated, could mean lesser demand for Nvidia's premium, high-powered hardware. Tighter export restrictions. In February, Bloomberg reported the Trump administration may tighten existing restrictions on semiconductor exports to China. Tariffs. In March, President Trump ramped up the tariff commentary, culminating with the ""Liberation Day"" announcement of sweeping reciprocal tariffs. Semiconductors are excluded from the latest tariff plan, but that could change. Although Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press briefing that he doesn't expect a big tariff impact, investors were still spooked. Global economic uncertainty. Even prior to the Liberation Day announcements, investors were becoming increasingly nervous about the tariff rhetoric from the U.S. presidential administration. The investing climate has become increasingly volatile as a result. Growth stocks, Nvidia included, have been hit as investors seek shelter in safer assets.  January through early April, Nvidia stock is down almost 30%.  MORE FOR YOUGoogle’s Android Update—Bad News For Samsung And Pixel Users‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 10Microsoft’s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users Factors Which May Impact A Nvidia Rebound The AI buildout has driven Nvidia's growth in recent years. Nvidia's AI data center sales are still increasing, but the pace has slowed and competition could become a factor soon. A full Nvidia rebound will likely require a different kind of breakthrough. Three opportunity areas to watch are robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving. Robotics Huang recently valued the opportunity in AI-powered robotics and automation at $50 trillion. The CEO says these technologies will ""transform manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other industries."" Nvidia has two platforms, Isaac and Cosmos, that support robotics and other types of physical AI.  Cloud Gaming Nvidia’s GeForce Now service uses the cloud to upgrade the gaming experience on any PC. Gamers connect their PC gaming accounts at Steam, Epic Games Store or Ubisoft Connect to GeForce Now for added hardware support—essentially turning any device into a gaming PC.  Nvidia announced expanded GeForce Now device support and capabilities at the 2025 CES trade show. Autonomous Driving Nvidia’s automotive line-up includes a platform for in-vehicle computing plus solutions for training AI driving models and simulating environments for testing. In 2025, the company announced automotive AI partnerships with Toyota, Aurora, Continental, GM, Gatik and Torc.   Nvidia expects its automotive business to deliver fiscal 2026 revenue of $5 billion, up from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2025. Risks And Challenges To Nvidia Alongside these opportunities, Nvidia faces some challenges. Regulatory changes, cheaper AI solutions and in-house chip development top the list. Regulatory Changes and Export Bans Changing Trump administration policies could pressure Nvidia’s stock price. Reciprocal tariffs, even with semiconductors excluded, could raise input costs and reduce margins. While Huang seems unbothered by the trade war developments, he also said he could move manufacturing to the U.S. if needed. That is a long-term solution. Unfortunately, growth investors are not known for their patience. A transition to domestic manufacturing would impact the NVDA stock price. More concerning than tariffs is the potential for export bans to China and import bans by China. Reports indicate Trump has considered tighter limits on chip sales to China. Meanwhile, Chinese regulators are discouraging sales of Nvidia's H20 chip—a product designed for export to China—because it doesn't meet efficiency standards, according to the Financial Times. Cheaper AI Solutions The rollout of DeepSeek caused angst for Nvidia shareholders. At issue was the $5.6 million total investment quoted by the AI app’s creator. The price tag seems tiny next to, say, Microsoft's $80 billion AI budget for fiscal 2025. The discrepancy prompted questions about Nvidia's growth outlook. If DeepSeek can do it, why can't big tech spend far less on Nvidia's AI hardware for the same results? Some experts have said the $5.6 million number from DeepSeek is misleading. Still, there will be a time when cost-efficiency enters the AI fray. That could create space for competitors to chip away at Nvidia's AI dominance. In-House Chip Development Big tech companies don’t want Nvidia to be the only AI chip game in town. It's too risky. They are mitigating that risk by developing in-house solutions. Alphabet (GOOG) recently introduced a collection of lightweight open-source AI models, Meta (META) is testing an AI chip and OpenAI has nearly finalized the design of its AI chip. These solutions will reduce Nvidia's business with existing customers over time. Nvidia will have to improve on performance and price as a result. Is Nvidia Stock A Buy During This Dip? Nvidia is an attractive, long-term buy right now despite regulatory and competitive challenges. The stock may not return to its pre-Trump growth rates, but it is an innovative, healthy company with a forward-thinking leader—and those qualities usually create shareholder value over time. Like many growth stocks, NVDA is volatile. Its per-share price can fall as quickly as it rises. You can see that dynamic in play for NVDA stock since it went public in 1999. So this stock is best suited for hardy, patient investors and those who already own NVDA and want to reduce their average cost basis. If you don't feel quite ready for NVDA, see this list of best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas. Bottom Line Nvidia is down nearly 30% this year as investors worry about tariffs, trade bans and lower-cost AI models. But the chip designer is not down for the count. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)Is Nvidia stock overvalued? After the recent downturn, Nvidia’s P/E ratio is about 32. That compares favorably to other semiconductor companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Arm Holdings (ARM).  Should I buy Nvidia stock now or wait? Nvidia is a well-run company that can navigate financial downturns and industry shifts. Relative to its history, the company's current valuation is appealing. If you don't mind volatility and believe in the AI promise as well as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, now is a good time to buy Nvidia stock. What are the biggest risks for Nvidia? The biggest risks for Nvidia are margin degradation from tariffs, the global impact of tariffs,  import and export bans and waning demand if others can replicate DeepSeek's low-power AI model.  Read Next  Missed Nvidia’s Stock Price Rally?

For instance, GuruFocus research shows that Broadcom has received a “Strong Buy” rating from nearly 88% of brokerage analysts.AdvertisementTrump’s trade war had sunk chip stocks as fears over slowing demand and high prices took hold. However, semiconductors are exempt from new tariff rates imposed on a slate of countries, which should insulate chip makers from some tariff turmoil.Also of concern: Data centers planned by major IT companies have been delayed or shelved as uncertainty surrounding ROI increases.AdvertisementMicrosoft (MSFT-3.14%) announced yesterday that it has abandoned its $1 billion data center project in Licking County, Ohio, citing a strategic investment review. Data centers are a key driver of chip manufacturing growth. 
2025-04-08T15:48:39Z;Is Nvidia Stock Too Cheap?;GERMANY - 2025/04/06: In this photo illustration, Nvidia Corporation logo is seen displayed on a ... More monitor. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Trefis  Question: Why would an investor pay 30 times earnings for Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) when Nvidia stock is trading at 33 times earnings? It wouldn't make much sense, especially when considering these three key points:   Growth: Nvidia’s revenue has been growing at an impressive rate of over 80% annually for the past three years, while Amazon’s growth rate is about 11%. Margins: Nvidia enjoys profit margins above 60%, meaning a greater share of revenue growth turns into shareholder profit. In comparison, Amazon’s operating margins are roughly 11%, so even with growth, a smaller slice becomes net profit. Tariffs: Nvidia’s revenue may be less vulnerable to international tariffs than Amazon’s. Amazon’s expansive global e-commerce operations expose it to more trade-related risks. Nvidia, while also operating internationally, likely faces less direct exposure to such tariffs.  Is Nvidia A Safe Bet? Some might consider Nvidia a “safe haven,” but its track record during market downturns tells a different story. For example, Nvidia stock dropped more than 65% during the 2022 inflation crisis. In 2020, amid pandemic uncertainty, the stock fell over 35%. Most significantly, during the 2008–2009 financial meltdown, Nvidia shares plummeted by 85%. Clearly, NVDA isn't a safe stock. For more detail, see our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? along with analysis of previous market crashes.   That said, Nvidia’s stock has already seen a considerable correction, falling from nearly $150 at the start of the year to below $100. For investors looking for a potentially steadier, high-performing approach, the Trefis High Quality portfoliomay be worth considering. This strategy has delivered over 75% returns since inception, as shown in its HQ performance metrics.  Nvidia: The AI Arms Provider If you believe in the continued rise and expansion of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be an attractive long-term play at current valuation levels. Nvidia essentially serves as an “arms supplier” in the AI arena. Investing in Nvidia is not a bet on any one player like OpenAI, Google, or Amazon, but rather on the backbone that supports them all. The AI race is still developing, and companies are pouring in resources. For example, Google’s infrastructure-related capital expenditure is approximately $75 billion, showing the scale of the investment.   Potential Risks to Consider Despite the optimism, Nvidia does face risks. Earnings could fall short of expectations, or growth might slow from 50% to around 30% as businesses tighten spending. Additionally, clients might pursue more efficient AI models, lessening the need for Nvidia’s chips. Unpredictable events could also negatively impact the stock. These factors suggest that downside risk—as much as 40%—is possible. Selling during such dips could hurt investors more than holding through volatility.

Those interested in navigating downturns or potentially gaining from them might look into the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has beaten its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices). Consulting with a financial advisor experienced in bear markets may also be wise.

Apple, which relies on factories in China to build its iPhones, is among the tech giants most vulnerable to sweeping tariffs. A temporary workaround for the Cupertino firm may include sending more of its India-built iPhones to the U.S. market to dodge the worst of the president’s tariffs. Temporarily exempt chipmakers and advertising giants (think: Nvidia and Meta) may fare better than hardware-focused companies such as Apple, but no tech giant is invulnerable to the fallout. Tariffs could take a bite out of the corporate ad budgets that firms like Meta subsist on, while tariffs-induced price hikes could slow gadget sales and ultimately hit chipmakers’ bottom lines."

AdvertisementRelated ContentWalmart and Warren Buffett on tariffs, a Target boycott, Starbucks layoffs: Business news roundupTarget's price hikes, Walmart's China strategy, and Starbucks' tough love: Retail news roundupRelated ContentWalmart and Warren Buffett on tariffs, a Target boycott, Starbucks layoffs: Business news roundupTarget's price hikes, Walmart's China strategy, and Starbucks' tough love: Retail news roundupTariffs hammer techPremarket moves among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were broadly lower Wednesday, with Tesla (TSLA-6.64%) off 1% and Apple slipping 2% in early trading. Amazon (AMZN-3.41%), Microsoft (MSFT-3.14%), and Nvidia (NVDA-5.47%) were also in the red. The renewed tariff war and surging yields have weighed heavily on growth names, reversing much of the sector’s 2025 momentum.AdvertisementBond yields also surged, with the 30-year Treasury topping 4.75% — its highest since mid-February. “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed,” economist Peter Schiff wrote on X. “The plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too.”Delta Air Lines plans to reduce capacityDelta kicked off the day with better-than-expected earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $0.46 versus the $0.38 expected by Wall Street. Adjusted revenue came in at $12.98 billion, matching forecasts, while net income jumped to $240 million, up from $37 million a year earlier. Shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading.AdvertisementBut while the headline numbers suggest resilience, Delta also said it plans to reduce flight capacity in the second quarter, signaling caution amid rising costs and shifting travel patterns. The airline cited the need to “restore operational reliability” and more tightly manage fuel and labor expenses.Cracking a Corona — or cutting back? Constellation knowsConstellation, the beverage giant behind Corona, Modelo, Kim Crawford, and Robert Mondavi, will report after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS of $2.27 on $2.12 billion in revenue. Watch for commentary on U.S. beer and wine sales — consumer staples that often shift in tone during periods of economic stress. Results could offer clues about household confidence as inflation lingers and real wages cool.AdvertisementShifting retail signals from Walmart and Big LotsEarly Wednesday, Walmart said it was pulling its Q1 guidance due to uncertainty surrounding newly imposed Trump tariffs on Chinese goods, particularly electric vehicles and consumer electronics. The move underscores how trade policy is clouding visibility for even the most dominant U.S. retailers.AdvertisementMeanwhile, Big Lots (BIG) also reports earnings today, though its place on the OTC market is a reminder of how far it’s fallen. Once a national discount heavyweight, Big Lots was delisted from the NYSE late last year and now trades as a penny stock. Its collapse adds to the growing wave of “retail wreckage” — from Red Lobster’s closures to Macy’s and Foot Locker (FL-8.43%), both of which are shuttering hundreds of stores across the country. Together, these developments highlight the pressure facing retailers: rising input costs, unpredictable trade policy, and a consumer base increasingly cautious about spending.AdvertisementBank earnings incomingThe first-quarter results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM-2.88%) and Wells Fargo (WFC-4.21%) land Friday. Analysts will be watching for loan growth, consumer credit quality, and recession contingency plans. With rate cut expectations pushed deeper into the year, margin commentary will be critical. These earnings may also help set the tone for Q2 investor sentiment.
